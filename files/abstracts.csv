1,A,"Parenting behaviors have been shown to moderate the association between sensation seeking and antisocial behaviors. Data were obtained from the Boricua Youth Study, a longitudinal study of 2,491 Puerto Rican youth living in the South Bronx, New York, and the metropolitan area of San Juan, Puerto Rico. First, we examined the prospective relationship between sensation seeking and antisocial behaviors across 3 yearly waves and whether this relationship varied by sociodemographic factors. Second, we examined the moderating role of parenting behaviors-including parental monitoring, warmth, and coercive discipline-on the prospective relationship between sensation seeking and antisocial behaviors. Sensation seeking was a strong predictor of antisocial behaviors for youth across two different sociocultural contexts. High parental monitoring buffered the association between sensation seeking and antisocial behaviors, protecting individuals with this trait. Low parental warmth was associated with high levels of antisocial behaviors, regardless of the sensation seeking level. Among those with high parental warmth, sensation seeking predicted antisocial behaviors, but the levels of antisocial behaviors were never as high as those of youth with low parental warmth. Study findings underscore the relevance of person-family context interactions in the development of antisocial behaviors. Future interventions should focus on the interplay between individual vulnerabilities and family context to prevent the unhealthy expression of a trait that is present in many individuals."
2,A,"Sleep variables have been linked to improved functioning of learning and memory throughout life, with most studies focusing on older children and adults. Since infancy is a time of outstanding plasticity, sleep variables could be particularly important for cognitive development in that age group. This is a longitudinal study collecting data from 40 infants at four different time points of 4, 6, 8 and 10 months. Sleep variables were assessed using actigraphy for a week, as well as a sleep questionnaire. Eye-tracking was employed to examine developmental cognitive trajectories. Infants had to remember the location of a toy that had previously been linked to a sound and an eye-tracker recorded whether they were searching the correct location upon hearing the sound. Based on their trajectories between 4 and 10 months, infants were divided into two groups who shifted their response strategies at different time points. Those two groups also differed in other aspects of their looking patterns and scored increasingly differently in the Ages & Stages Questionnaire over time. Time spent awake in the night early in life was reduced in the group who changed their strategy earlier. While previous research examined the relation of infant sleep and cognitive functioning measured once, this paper provides first evidence that night wake time can serve as a marker for different cognitive trajectories."
3,A,"Childhood risk factors are associated with elevated inflammatory biomarkers in adulthood, but it is unknown whether these risk factors are associated with increased adult levels of the chronic inflammation marker soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR). We aimed to test the hypothesis that childhood exposure to risk factors for adult disease is associated with elevated suPAR in adulthood and to compare suPAR with the oft-reported inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein (CRP). Prospective study of a population-representative 1972-1973 birth cohort; the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study observed participants to age 38 years. Main childhood predictors were poor health, socioeconomic disadvantage, adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), low IQ, and poor self-control. Main adult outcomes were adulthood inflammation measured as suPAR and high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP). Participants with available plasma samples at age 38 were included (N = 837, 50.5% male). suPAR (mean 2.40 ng/ml; SD 0.91) was positively correlated with hsCRP (r 0.15, p < .001). After controlling for sex, body mass index (BMI), and smoking, children who experienced more ACEs, lower IQ, or had poorer self-control showed elevated adult suPAR. When the five childhood risks were aggregated into a Cumulative Childhood Risk index, and controlling for sex, BMI, and smoking, Cumulative Childhood Risk was associated with higher suPAR (b 0.10; SE 0.03; p = .002). Cumulative Childhood Risk predicted elevated suPAR, after controlling for hsCRP (b 0.18; SE 0.03; p < .001). Exposure to more childhood risk factors was associated with higher suPAR levels, independent of CRP. suPAR is a useful addition to studies connecting childhood risk to adult inflammatory burden."
4,A,"The 'dysregulation profile' (DP) is a measure of emotional and behavioral dysregulation that may cut across diagnostic boundaries. Siblings of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) who do not develop ASD themselves are at risk for atypical outcomes including behavioral challenges and therefore may be a useful population in which to investigate the structure of the DP in preschoolers. We sought to examine the factor structure and predictors of the DP in a sample enriched for a wide range of phenotypic variation-36-month-olds with and without family histories of ASD-and to determine whether children with genetic liability for ASD are at risk for a phenotype characterized by elevated dysregulation. Data were collected from 415 children with (n = 253) and without (n = 162) an older sibling with ASD, all without ASD themselves, at 18, 24, and 36 months of age. Our findings replicate prior reports, conducted in predominantly clinically referred and older samples, supporting the superiority of a bifactor model of the DP in the preschool period compared to the second-order and one-factor models. Examiner ratings were longitudinally and concurrently associated with the DP at 36 months of age. Family history of ASD was associated with higher dysregulation in the Anxious/Depressed dimension. These findings support the relevance of examining the structure of psychopathology in preschoolers and suggest that examiner observations as early as 18 months of age, particularly of overactivity, may help identify risk for later DP-related concerns. Non-ASD preschoolers with family histories of ASD may be at risk for a phenotype characterized by elevated dysregulation particularly in the Anxious/Depressed dimension by age 3."
5,A,"Health anxiety (HA) is an increasing public health problem related to increased health service costs, and associated with functional somatic symptoms (FSS) and considerable personal suffering. Abnormal bodily experiences which may resemble HA and FSS are common in psychotic disorders, but a potential link between HA and psychosis vulnerability in childhood is largely unexplored. The current study estimates the association between subclinical psychotic experiences (PE) and HA and FSS in a general population cohort of preadolescents. The study population consisted of 1,572 11-12-year-old children from the Copenhagen Child Cohort 2000. PE were comprehensibly assessed as either present or not present using the Kiddie Schedule of Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia psychosis section. HA and FSS were assessed by self-report on validated questionnaires. Additional variables on general psychopathology, puberty, and chronic somatic illness were also obtained. Psychotic experiences were associated with the top 10% high scores of HA (Odds Ratio (OR) 3.2; 95% CI: 2.1-4.8) and FSS (OR 4.6; 95% CI: 3.1-6.9) in univariate analyses. After mutual adjustment, the association was reduced to (HA: OR 2.3; 95% CI: 1.5-3.5; FSS: OR 3.7; 95% CI: 2.4-4.7), suggesting interdependence. Further adjustment for potential confounders and general psychopathology only reduced the associations slightly: HA OR 2.2 (95% CI: 1.4-3.4); FSS OR 3.3 (95% CI: 2.1-5.2). Secondary analyses of subdimensions of HA showed that PE were associated with fears (OR 3.0; 95% CI: 2.0-4.6) and daily impact of HA symptoms (OR 5.0; 95% CI: 3.4-7.5), but not help seeking (OR 1.2; 95% CI: 0.7-2.1). This is the first study to investigate the associations between PE and HA and FSS, respectively. PE were significantly associated with HA and FSS over and above general psychopathology in preadolescence. Individuals with PE expressed high levels of health-related fears and daily impact, but no corresponding help-seeking behavior."
6,A,"The aim of this study is to provide a better understanding of the central symptoms of DSM-5 posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in children and adolescents from the perspective of the child and its caregiver. Identifying core symptoms of PTSD can help clinicians to understand what may be relevant targets for treatment. PTSD may present itself differently in children and adolescents compared to adults, and no study so far has investigated the DSM-5 PTSD conceptualization using network analysis. The network structure of DSM-5 PTSD was investigated in a clinical sample of n = 475 self-reports of children and adolescents and n = 424 caregiver-reports using (a) regularized partial correlation models and (b) a Bayesian approach computing directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). (a) The 20 DSM-5 PTSD symptoms were positively connected within the self-report and the caregiver-report sample. The most central symptoms were negative trauma-related cognitions and persistent negative emotional state for the self-report and negative trauma-related cognitions, intrusive thoughts or memories and exaggerated startle response for the caregiver-report. (b) Similarly, symptoms in the negative alterations in cognitions and mood cluster (NACM) have emerged as key drivers of other symptoms in traumatized children and adolescents. As the symptoms in the DSM-5 NACM cluster were central in our regularized partial correlation networks and also appeared to be the driving forces in the DAGs, these might represent important symptoms within PTSD symptomatology and may offer key targets in PTSD treatment for children and adolescents."
7,A,"Evidence supporting clinical relevance and persistence of disinhibited social engagement behavior (DSEB) pertains mostly to children reared in institutions and foster care. This study examined the course of DSEB in clinically referred home-reared children from early into middle childhood, and associations with neglect/emotional maltreatment, effortful control, Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, and Autism Spectrum Disorder. Disinhibited social engagement behavior was examined in 124 children (82% boys, M = 4.06 years, SD = 0.89), referred for treatment of emotional and behavioral problems, by use of the Disturbances of Attachment Interview (DAI) with biological parents. Neglect and emotional maltreatment were assessed from case records and effortful control by use of the Child Behavior Questionnaire. At follow-up, on average 4 years later, DSEB was examined by use of DAI as well as two observational ratings: the Stranger at the Door procedure (SatD) and a structured home observation of stranger approach. Psychiatric disorders were assessed by means of the Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia. Persistence of parent-reported DSEB was found in 57% (n = 27) of the children with DSEB at baseline (n = 47). Parent-reported DSEB at follow-up was significantly related to DSEB observed in the SatD (r(pb) = .31, p = .001) and to observed stranger approach (r(s) = .41, p < .001), but only stranger approach was associated with baseline DSEB. The course of DSEB was not related to neglect/emotional maltreatment, nor to the level of effortful control. There was no association between DSEB and Autism Spectrum Disorder, but course of DSEB was associated with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder/Oppositional Defiant Disorder at follow-up (chi(2) = 13.08, p = .004). Although explanations for the onset and course of DSEB in home-reared children remain elusive, findings suggest that DSEB is part of a complex of clinically significant problem behaviors in referred home-reared preschool children."
8,B,"This Article argues that international investment agreements (IIAs) serve a dual economic function-to discipline host country policies that impose international externalities on foreign investors, and to curtail inefficient risks associated with agency costs, risk aversion, asymmetric information, and time inconsistency problems that uneconomically increase the cost of imported capital in host countries. It draws on the economic analysis to explain central features of IIAs and their evolution over time, and to address various controversial issues in international investment litigation."
9,B,"In 1822, the Russian czar resolved a dispute over compensation for slaves fleeing to British lines during the War of 1812. American observers have long asserted that this canonical decision favored the United States. But new debate has recently arisen among historians. Uncovering evidence from diplomatic archives, this Article concludes that the czar did indeed side with the United States. Moreover, the case demonstrates how nineteenth-century American statesmen pressed international law into service in support of slavery."
10,A,"This study evaluated whether clinical and economic outcomes from CBT for child anxiety disorders in the context of maternal anxiety disorders are improved by adding treatment focused on (a) maternal anxiety disorders or (b) mother-child interactions. Two hundred and eleven children (7-12 years, 85% White British, 52% female) with a primary anxiety disorder, whose mothers also had a current anxiety disorder, were randomised to receive (a) child-focused CBT with nonspecific control interventions (CCBT+Con), (b) CCBT with CBT for the maternal anxiety disorder (CCBT+MCBT), or (c) CCBT with an intervention targeting the mother-child interaction (CCBT+MCI). A cost-utility analysis from a societal perspective was conducted using mother/child combined quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). [Trial registration: ]. MCBT was associated with immediate reductions in maternal anxiety compared to the nonspecific control; however, after children had also received CCBT, maternal outcomes in the CCBT+MCI and CCBT+Con arms improved and CCBT+MCBT was no longer superior. Neither CCBT+MCBT nor CCBT+MCI conferred a benefit over CCBT+Con in terms of child anxiety disorder diagnoses post-treatment [primary outcome] (adj RR: 1.22 (95% CI: 0.88, 1.67), p = .23; adj RR: 1.21 (95% CI: 0.88, 1.65), p = .24, respectively) or global improvement ratings (adj RR: 1.25 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.57), p = .06; adj RR: 1.18 (95% CI: 0.93, 1.50), p = .17) or six and 12 months later. No significant differences between the groups were found on the main economic outcome measures (child/mother combined QALY mean difference: CCBT+MCBT vs. CCBT+Con: -0.04 (95% CI: -0.12, 0.04), p = .29; CCBT+MCI vs. CCBT+Con: 0.02 (95% CI: -0.05, -0.09), p = .54). CCBT+MCI was associated with nonsignificantly higher costs than CCBT (mean difference: 154 pound (95% CI: -1,239 pound, 1,547) pound, p = .83) but, when taking into account sampling uncertainty, it may be cost-effective compared with CCBT alone. Good outcomes were achieved for children and their mothers across treatment arms. There was no evidence of significant clinical benefit from supplementing CCBT with either CBT for the maternal anxiety disorder or treatment focussed on mother-child interactions, but the addition of MCI (and not MCBT) may be cost-effective."
11,A,"Strengthening social integration could prevent suicidal behavior. However, minimal research has examined social integration through relationship network structure. To address this important gap, we tested whether structural characteristics of school networks predict school rates of ideation and attempts. In 38 US high schools, 10,291 students nominated close friends and trusted adults to construct social networks. We used mixed-effects logistic regression models to test individual student networks and likelihood of suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempts (SA); and linear regression models to estimate associations between school network characteristics and school rates of SI, SA, and SA among all with ideation. Lower peer network integration and cohesion increased likelihood of SI and SA across individual and school-level models. Two factors increased SA: student isolation from adults and suicidal students' popularity and clustering. A multivariable model identified higher SA in schools where youth-adult relationships were concentrated in fewer students (B = 4.95 [1.46, 8.44]) and suicidal students had higher relative popularity versus nonsuicidal peers (B = 0.93 [0.10, 1.77]). Schools had lower SA rates when more students named the same trusted adults named by friends and many students named the same trusted adults. When adjusting for depression, violence victimization and bullying, estimates for adult network characteristics were substantially unchanged whereas some peer effects decreased. Schoolwide peer and youth-adult relationship patterns influence SA rates beyond individual student connections. Network characteristics associated with suicide attempts map onto three theory-informed domains: social integration versus thwarted relational needs, group cohesion, and suicidal students' social influence. Network interventions addressing these processes, such as maximizing youth-adult connections schoolwide and heightening influence of youth with healthy coping, could create more protective schools. Longitudinal and intervention studies are needed to determine how schools differentiate in network structure and clarify reciprocal dynamics between network characteristics and suicidal behavior."
12,A,"In a large body of previous research, cross-lagged panel models (CLPMs) have been used to provide empirical support for developmental models that posit a cascade from externalising-to-internalising problems. These developmental models, however, arguably refer to within-person processes whereas CLPMs provide a difficult-to-interpret blend of within- and between- person effects. We used autoregressive latent trajectory models with structured residuals (ALT-SR) to evaluate whether there is evidence for externalising-to-internalising cascades at the within-person level when disaggregating between- and within- person effects. We used eight waves of data (age 7-15) from the Zurich Project on Social Development from Childhood to Adulthood (z-proso). ALT-SR fit better than the corresponding CLPMs. Using an ALT-SR, we found evidence for externalising-to-internalising cascades, consistent with previous CLPM studies. However, we also found some evidence for effects in the ALT-SR that were not apparent in the CLPM, including a negative effect of externalising on internalising problems in adolescence. In addition, a negative effect of internalising on externalising problems in adolescence was found in both the CLPM and ALT-SR. Within-person results were largely consistent with previous evidence from CLPMs; however, at the within-person level, externalising and internalising may negatively influence one another in adolescence."
13,A,"Previous research demonstrated atypical attention in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Regarding visual orienting, findings suggest a differential impairment: Atypical orienting to relatively unexpected targets in ASD, and atypical processing of alerting cues in ADHD. The locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system plays an important role in exploiting alerting cues to increase attention and task performance. The present study's aim was to examine differential subcortical processes underlying visual orienting in ASD and ADHD with pupil dilation (PD) as index of LC activity. Pupil dilation (PD) progression metrics during visual orienting were calculated for task-evoked PD locked to cue, stimulus onset, and behavioral response. Group differences in PD and reaction time (RT) were compared between children with ASD without ADHD (ASD-) (N = 18), ADHD without ASD (ADHD-) (N = 28), both disorders (ASD + ADHD) (N = 14), and typically developing children (TD) (N = 31) using linear mixed models (LMM). To further explore the modulatory role of the LC-NE system group differences in the effect of task-evoked PD metrics on RT were examined exploratively. ASD (+ADHD) showed slower orienting responses to relatively unexpected spatial target stimuli as compared to TD, which was accompanied by higher PD amplitudes relative to ADHD- and TD. In ADHD-, shorter cue-evoked PD latencies relative to ASD-, ASD + ADHD, and TD were found. Group differences in the effect of cue- and stimulus-evoked PD amplitudes on RT were found in ASD- relative to TD. Study findings provide new evidence for a specific role of the LC-NE system in impaired reflexive orienting responses in ASD, and atypical visual processing of alerting cues in ADHD."
14,A,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may be phenotypically and etiologically linked. However, due to the absence of prospective studies, it remains unclear whether the elevation of autistic traits in AN is evident in early childhood. Here, we prospectively investigated autistic traits before and after the first diagnosis of AN. In a population-based sample of 5,987 individuals (52.4% female) from the Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden, parents reported autistic traits at ages 9 and 18. AN and ASD diagnoses were retrieved from the Swedish National Patient Register. In addition, AN diagnoses were ascertained by parent-reported treatment for AN. We compared whether individuals with and without AN differed in autistic traits before the first diagnosis of AN (age 9) and after the first diagnosis of AN (age 18). We did not find evidence for elevated autistic traits in 9-year-old children later diagnosed with AN. At age 18, however, there was a marked elevation in restricted/repetitive behavior and interests, but only in the subgroup of individuals with acute AN. A less pronounced elevation was observed for social communication problems. Coping strategies in individuals with ASD and the somewhat different female ASD phenotype may explain why we did not find elevated autistic traits in children who later developed AN. Alternatively, it is possible that elevated autistic traits were not present prior to the onset of AN, thus questioning the previously reported elevated prevalence of ASD in AN. Future studies should use tailored measurements in order to investigate whether autistic traits in individuals with AN are best conceptualized as an epiphenomenon of the acute AN phase or whether these symptoms indeed represent ASD as a clinically verifiable neurodevelopmental disorder."
15,A,"Aggression in children has genetic and environmental causes. Studies of aggression can pool existing datasets to include more complex models of social effects. Such analyses require large datasets with harmonized outcome measures. Here, we made use of a reference panel for phenotype data to harmonize multiple aggression measures in school-aged children to jointly analyze data from five large twin cohorts. Individual level aggression data on 86,559 children (42,468 twin pairs) were available in five European twin cohorts measured by different instruments. A phenotypic reference panel was collected which enabled a model-based phenotype harmonization approach. A bi-factor integration model in the integrative data analysis framework was developed to model aggression across studies while adjusting for rater, age, and sex. Finally, harmonized aggression scores were analyzed to estimate contributions of genes, environment, and social interaction to aggression. The large sample size allowed adequate power to test for sibling interaction effects, with unique dynamics permitted for opposite-sex twins. The best-fitting model found a high level of overall heritability of aggression (similar to 60%). Different heritability rates of aggression across sex were marginally significant, with heritability estimates in boys of similar to 64% and similar to 58% in girls. Sibling interaction effects were only significant in the opposite-sex twin pairs: the interaction effect of males on their female co-twin differed from the effect of females on their male co-twin. An aggressive female had a positive effect on male co-twin aggression, whereas more aggression in males had a negative influence on a female co-twin. Opposite-sex twins displayed unique social dynamics of aggressive behaviors in a joint analysis of a large, multinational dataset. The integrative data analysis framework, applied in combination with a reference panel, has the potential to elucidate broad, generalizable results in the investigation of common psychological traits in children."
16,A,"Low educational attainment in parents is associated with child psychopathology. It is not clear whether the associations are due to risk factors that family members share or due to effects of maternal or paternal education on the offspring. We investigate whether associations between maternal and paternal educational attainment and child symptoms of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, and academic problems are due to shared genetic factors, shared family environmental factors, or effects of the parental phenotype educational attainment itself. This study is based on the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). The sample comprised 34,958 children (17,128 girls) in 28,372 extended-family units. We used data from related nuclear families linked by siblings in the parent generation. We applied a quasi-experimental extended children-of-twins design that included siblings in both generations and took account of nonrandom mating by including partners. Educational attainment was self-reported by mothers and fathers. Mothers reported children's symptoms of ADHD, symptoms of depression, and academic problems by questionnaire when the children were 8 years old. Children of lowly educated parents scored higher on all outcomes and had an approximate doubling of the risk of high symptom levels. The association between maternal and paternal educational attainment and child symptoms of ADHD and academic problems persisted after controlling for shared genetic and family environmental factors. Phenotypic transmission to depression was weaker and in the best fitting model fully explained by genetic factors shared by the two generations. Associations between educational attainment of mothers and fathers and child symptoms of ADHD and academic problems could not be ascribed to shared familial risk factors, whereas associations with symptoms of depression could. Parental education or resources and behaviors resulting from low education might be targets of interventions aimed at reducing symptoms of ADHD and academic problems."
17,A,"Autism Spectrum Disorder is highly heterogeneous, no more so than in the complex world of adult life. Being able to summarize that complexity and have some notion of the confidence with which we could predict outcome from childhood would be helpful for clinical practice and planning. Latent class profile analysis is applied to data from 123 participants from the Early Diagnosis Study (Lord et al., Archives of General Psychiatry, 2006, 63, 694) to summarize in a typology the multifacetted early adult outcome of children referred for autism around age 2. The form of the classes and their predictability from childhood is described. Defined over 15 measures, the adult outcomes were reduced to four latent classes, accounting for much of the variation in cognitive and functional measures but little in the affective measures. The classes could be well and progressively more accurately predicted from childhood IQ and symptom severity measurement taken at age 2 years to age 9 years. Removing verbal and nonverbal IQ and autism symptom severity measurement from the profile of adult measures did not change the number of the latent classes; however, there was some change in the class composition and they were more difficult to predict. While an empirical summary of adult outcome is possible, careful consideration needs to be given to the aspects that should be given priority. An outcome typology that gives weight to cognitive outcomes is well predicted from corresponding measures taken in childhood, even after account for prediction bias from fitting a complex model to a small sample. However, subjective well-being and affective aspects of adult outcome were weakly related to functional outcomes and poorly predicted from childhood."
18,A,"Adolescence is characterized by substantial changes in sleep behavior, heightened exposure to stressful life events (SLEs), and elevated risk for internalizing problems like anxiety and depression. Although SLEs are consistently associated with the onset of internalizing psychopathology, the mechanisms underlying this relationship remain poorly understood, especially at the within-person level. Here, we leverage a high-frequency longitudinal design to examine sleep as a potential mechanism linking SLEs to increases in anxiety and depression symptoms over a one-year period. Thirty female adolescents aged 15-17 years completed 12 monthly in-laboratory assessments of exposure to SLEs and symptoms of anxiety and depression (n = 355 monthly assessments), and wore an actigraphy wristband for continuous monitoring of sleep for the duration of the study (n = 6,824 sleep days). Multilevel models examined concurrent and lagged within-person associations between SLEs, sleep duration and timing regularity, and anxiety and depression symptoms. Within-person fluctuations in SLEs were associated with variability in sleep duration both concurrently and prospectively, such that when adolescents experienced greater SLEs than was typical for them, they exhibited more variable sleep duration that same month as well as the following month. In turn, within-person increases in sleep duration variability predicted greater anxiety symptoms in the same month and mediated the association between SLEs and anxiety. These findings highlight sleep disruptions as a mechanism underlying the longitudinal associations between SLEs and anxiety symptoms, and suggest that interventions promoting sleep schedule consistency may help mitigate risk for stress-related psychopathology in adolescence."
19,A,"The heritability of language and literacy skills increases from early-childhood to adolescence. The underlying mechanisms are little understood and may involve (a) the amplification of genetic influences contributing to early language abilities, and/or (b) the emergence of novel genetic factors (innovation). Here, we investigate the developmental origins of genetic factors influencing mid-childhood/early-adolescent language and literacy. We evaluate evidence for the amplification of early-childhood genetic factors for vocabulary, in addition to genetic innovation processes. Expressive and receptive vocabulary scores at 38 months, thirteen language- and literacy-related abilities and nonverbal cognition (7-13 years) were assessed in unrelated children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC,N-individuals <= 6,092). We investigated the multivariate genetic architecture underlying early-childhood expressive and receptive vocabulary, and each of 14 mid-childhood/early-adolescent language, literacy or cognitive skills with trivariate structural equation (Cholesky) models as captured by genome-wide genetic relationship matrices. The individual path coefficients of the resulting structural models were finally meta-analysed to evaluate evidence for overarching patterns. We observed little support for the emergence of novel genetic sources for language, literacy or cognitive abilities during mid-childhood or early adolescence. Instead, genetic factors of early-childhood vocabulary, especially those unique to receptive skills, were amplified and represented the majority of genetic variance underlying many of these later complex skills (<= 99%). The most predictive early genetic factor accounted for 29.4%(SE = 12.9%) to 45.1%(SE = 7.6%) of the phenotypic variation in verbal intelligence and literacy skills, but also for 25.7%(SE = 6.4%) in performance intelligence, while explaining only a fraction of the phenotypic variation in receptive vocabulary (3.9%(SE = 1.8%)). Genetic factors contributing to many complex skills during mid-childhood and early adolescence, including literacy, verbal cognition and nonverbal cognition, originate developmentally in early-childhood and are captured by receptive vocabulary. This suggests developmental genetic stability and overarching aetiological mechanisms."
20,A,"Findings from primarily cross-sectional studies have linked more extensive social media use to poorer sleep and affective wellbeing among adolescents and young adults. This study examined bedtime social media use, sleep, and affective wellbeing, using an experience sampling methodology with the aim of establishing a day-to-day temporal link between the variables. The study hypothesized a positive association between increased bedtime social media use and lower affective wellbeing the following day, mediated by poorer sleep. Using a smartphone application, 101 undergraduate students (M-age = 19.70 years,SD = 1.09 years), completed daily questionnaires assessing the previous night's bedtime social media use and sleep duration and satisfaction (one measurement per day, questionnaire sent at 08:00), and momentary affective wellbeing (five measurements per day, at randomly varying times between 08:00 and 22:00 on weekdays and 10:00 and 22:00 on weekends), for 14 consecutive days. Objective assessments of total sleep time and sleep efficiency were obtained via wrist-worn actigraphs. By means of separate multilevel models, it was tested whether increased bedtime social media use predicted poorer sleep the same night, whether poorer sleep was predictive of positive and negative affect the following day, and whether sleep mediated the relationship between social media use and affective wellbeing. Increased bedtime social media use was not associated with poorer sleep the same night. Apart from subjective sleep satisfaction, no other sleep variable (i.e., subjective sleep duration, objective total sleep time and objective sleep efficiency) predicted positive or negative affect the following day. This study found that bedtime social media use is not detrimental to the sleep and affective wellbeing of healthy young adults. However, it is possible that bedtime social media use may be harmful to the sleep of vulnerable individuals."
21,A,"The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and the consequent global lockdown posed a particular challenge for youths with mental health problems. Crucial interference with their everyday lives likely increased psychological distress while accessibility of conventional mental health care was limited. Ongoing online trials offer a unique opportunity to analyse mental health status and help-seeking behaviour of adolescents during the pandemic. The ProHEAD-online trial aims at improving help-seeking behaviour of children and adolescents with significant psychological impairment. From January to May 2020, 1,042 students had access to the ProHEAD-online platform providing information on mental illness, monitoring, peer support and professional counselling. In the week from 11 March, when schools were closed in Germany, a drastic (more than 2 standard deviations) but time-limited increase in utilization of the ProHEAD-online services became apparent. This may indicate a worsened mental health status and an increased help seeking via digital services during the lockdown. Although this finding is purely observational, it speaks to the importance of evidence-based online service in the field of mental health within the current crisis and beyond."
22,A,"Autism is more prevalent in males than in females. Hypotheses related to the extreme male brain theory of autism suggest that heightened androgen exposure during early development contributes to autistic traits. Whilst prior research focused mostly on the prenatal period, the current study tests the influences of androgen exposure during both the prenatal and the early postnatal periods on autistic traits during childhood. Anthropometric measures that are putative biomarkers of early androgen exposure were employed. Anogenital distance (AGD) was measured at birth and 3 months of age in boys and girls. Penile length at birth and 3 months of age was also measured in boys. When the children were 9-13 years old, a parent-reported questionnaire (the 10-item children's version of the Autism Spectrum Quotient; AQ-10 Child) was used to assess autistic traits in 97 boys and 110 girls. There were no significant associations between any of the AGD or penile length measures and scores on the AQ-10 Child in boys, girls or the entire sample. The current study provides the first test of whether early measurements of AGD and/or penile length predict subsequent autistic traits. The current findings do not support a relationship between prenatal or early postnatal androgen exposure and autistic traits. The current study augments prior research showing no consistent relationship between early androgen exposure and autistic traits."
23,C,"Star clusters have long been considered to comprise a simple stellar population, but this paradigm is being challenged, since in addition to multiple populations in Galactic globular clusters', a number of younger star clusters exhibit a significant colour spread at the main sequence turn-off(2-9). A sequential evolution of multiple generations of stars formed over 100-200 Myr is a natural explanation of this colour spread(10). Another approach to explain this feature is to introduce the effect of stellar rotation(11). However, its effectiveness has not yet been proven due to the lack of direct measurements of rotational velocities. Here, we report the distribution of projected rotational velocities (V-eq sin i) of stars in the Galactic open cluster M11, measured by Fourier transform analysis. Cluster members display a broad V-eg sin i distribution, and fast rotators, including Be stars, have redder colours than slow rotators. Monte Carlo simulations infer that cluster members have highly aligned spin axes and a broad distribution of equatorial velocities biased towards high velocities. Our synthetic cluster simulation further demonstrates how stellar rotation affects the colours of cluster members, suggesting that the colour spread observed in populous clusters can be understood in the context of stellar evolution without introducing multiple stellar populations."
24,C,"Clouds and aerosols provide unique insight into the chemical and physical processes of gas-giant planets. Mapping and characterizing the spectral features indicative of the cloud structure and composition enables an understanding of a planet's energy budget, chemistry and atmospheric dynamics(1-4). Current space missions to Solar System planets produce high-quality datasets, yet the sheer amount of data obtained often prohibits detailed 'by hand' analyses. Current techniques rely mainly on two approaches: identifying the existence of spectral features by dividing the fluxes of two or more spectral channels, and performing full radiative transfer calculations for individual spectra. The first method is not sufficiently accurate and the second is not easily scalable to the entire planetary surface. Here we have developed a deep learning algorithm, PlanetNet, that is able to quickly and accurately map spatial and spectral features across large, heterogeneous areas of a planet. We use PlanetNet to delineate the major components of the 2008 storm on Saturn(5), enhancing the scope of the area previously studied and indicating regions that can be probed more deeply with radiative transfer models. Our spectral-component maps indicate compositional and cloud variations of the vast region affected by the storm, showing regions of vertical upwelling, and diminished clouds at the centre of compact substorms."
25,C,"Although their parent stars no longer exist, the isotopic and chemical compositions and microstructure of individual stardust grains identified in meteorites provide unique constraints on dust formation and thermodynamic conditions in stellar outflows(1-5). Novae are stellar explosions that take place in the hydrogen-rich envelope accreted onto the surface of a white dwarf in a close binary system(6). The energy released by a suite of nuclear processes operating in the envelope powers a thermonuclear runaway, resulting in the ejection of processed material into the interstellar medium. Spectral fitting of features observed in the infrared spectra of dust-forming novae provided evidence of the co-condensation of both carbonaceous and silicate dust in stellar outflows within 50 to 100 days after explosion(7-9). Although novae appear as prolific producers of both carbon-and oxygen-rich dust, very few presolar grains that can be attributed to novae have been found in meteorites thus far(10-16). Here, we report the identification of an oxygen-rich inclusion, composed of both silicate and oxide nanoparticles, inside a graphite spherule that originated in the ejecta of a low-mass carbon- and oxygen-rich (CO) nova. This observation establishes laboratory evidence of the co-condensation of oxygen- and carbon-rich dust in nova outbursts and is consistent with large-scale transport and mixing of materials between chemically distinct clumps in the nova ejecta."
26,C,"Small stellar systems such as dwarf galaxies are suggested to be the main building blocks of our Galaxy according to numerical simulations(1) in Lambda cold dark matter models and observational support for this hypothesis comes from the existence of stellar streams such as the Sagittarius tidal stream(2). However, it is unclear how many and what kind of stars in our Galaxy originate from satellite dwarf galaxies, something that could be constrained by analysing chemical abundances of metal-poor stars. Here we report on the discovery of a metal-poor star with an extreme r-process enhancement and alpha-element deficiency. In this star, the abundance ratio of the r-process element Eu with respect to Fe is more than one order of magnitude larger than the Sun and the metallicity is 1/20 of solar metallicity. Stars like this one have been found in present-day dwarf galaxies, providing the clearest chemical signature of past accretion events onto the Milky Way. The long timescale of chemical evolution of the host dwarf galaxy expected from the abundance of alpha-elements with respect to Fe suggests that the accretion occurred in a relatively late phase compared with most of the accretions that formed the bulk of the Milky Way halo."
27,C,"Close binary systems often show linear polarization varying over the binary period, usually attributed to light scattered from electrons in circumstellar clouds(1-3). One of the brightest close binary systems is Spica (alpha Virginis) consisting of two B-type stars orbiting with a period of just over four days. Past observations of Spica have shown low polarization with no evidence for variability(4-6). Here we report new high-precision polarization observations of Spica that show variation with an amplitude of about 200 parts per million. By including polarized radiative transfer in a binary star model, we show that the phase-dependent polarization is mainly due to light reflected from the primary component of the binary system off the secondary component and vice versa. The stars reflect only a few per cent of the incident light, but the reflected light is very highly polarized. The polarization results show that the binary orbit is clockwise and the position angle of the line of nodes is 130.4 degrees +/- 6.8 degrees, in agreement with intensity interferometer results(7). We suggest that reflected light polarization may be much more important in binary systems than has previously been recognized and may be a way of detecting previously unrecognized close binaries."
28,C,"The Sun is an active star that can launch large eruptions of magnetized plasma into the heliosphere, known as corona! mass ejections (CMEs). These can drive shocks that accelerate particles to high energies, often resulting in radio emission at low frequencies (<200 MHz). So far, the relationship between the expansion of CMEs, shocks and particle acceleration is not well understood, partly due to the lack of radio imaging at low frequencies during the onset of shock-producing CMEs. Here, we report multi-instrument radio, white-light and ultraviolet imaging of the second largest flare in solar cycle 24 (2008-present) and its associated fast CME (3,038 +/- 288 km s(-1)). We identify the location of a multitude of radio shock signatures, called herringbones, and find evidence for shock-accelerated electron beams at multiple locations along the expanding CME. These observations support theories of non-uniform, rippled shock fronts driven by an expanding CME in the solar corona."
29,C,"The massive evolved Wolf-Rayet stars sometimes occur in colliding-wind binary systems in which dust plumes are formed as a result of the collision of stellar winds(1). These structures are known to encode the parameters of the binary orbit and winds(2-4). Here we report observations of a previously undiscovered Wolf-Rayet system, 2XMM J160050.7-514245, with a spectroscopically determined wind speed of similar to 3,400 km s(-1). In the thermal infrared, the system is adorned with a prominent similar to 12 '' spiral dust plume, revealed by proper motion studies to be expanding at only similar to 570 km s(-1). As the dust and gas appear to be coeval, these observations are inconsistent with existing models of the dynamics of such colliding-wind systems(5-7). We propose that this contradiction can be resolved if the system is capable of launching extremely anisotropic winds. Near-critical stellar rotation is known to drive such winds(8,9), suggesting that this Wolf-Rayet system may be a Galactic progenitor system for long-duration gamma-ray bursts."
30,C,"In September 2017, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory recorded a very-high-energy neutrino in directional coincidence with a blazar in an unusually bright gamma-ray state, TXS0506 + 056 (refs(1,2)). Blazars are prominent photon sources in the Universe because they harbour a relativistic jet whose radiation is strongly collimated and amplified. High-energy atomic nuclei known as cosmic rays can produce neutrinos; thus, the recent detection may help in identifying the sources of the diffuse neutrino flux(3) and the energetic cosmic rays. Here we report a self-consistent analysis of the physical relation between the observed neutrino and the blazar, in particular the time evolution and spectral behaviour of neutrino and photon emission. We demonstrate that a moderate enhancement in the number of cosmic rays during the flare can yield a very strong increase in the neutrino flux, which is limited by co-produced hard X-rays and teraelectronvolt gamma rays. We also test typical radiation models(4,5) for compatibility and identify several model classes(6,7) as incompatible with the observations. We investigate to what degree the findings can be generalized to the entire population of blazars, determine the relation between their output in photons, neutrinos and cosmic rays, and suggest how to optimize the strategy of future observations."
31,B,"On May 30, 2018, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (Court) ordered Peru to review the presidential pardon granted to former president and dictator Alberto Fujimori, who had been convicted and imprisoned for his role in serious human rights violations. The Peruvian Supreme Court obliged and, after examining the merits of the presidential pardon through a special procedure set up to assess the pardon's conformity with international human rights law, invalidated the pardon, effectively reinstating Fujimori's imprisonment for crimes against humanity."
32,B,"In Cortec v. Kenya, an investor-state arbitral tribunal established under a bilateral investment treaty (BIT) held it lacked jurisdiction to hear a dispute concerning a mining project that the tribunal found did not comply with domestic environmental law. The award raises significant issues of public international law, including how questions of investor compliance are considered in investor-state dispute settlement and the legal implications of investor noncompliance. The issues resonate with wider debates about balancing investor rights and obligations in the international investment regime."
33,C,"Recently, gas disks have been discovered around main-sequence stars well beyond the usual protoplanetary disk lifetimes (that is, greater than or similar to 10 Myr), when planets have already formed(1-4). These gas disks, mainly composed of CO, carbon and oxygen(5-7), seem to be ubiquitous(3) in systems with planetesimal belts (similar to our Kuiper belt), and can last for hundreds of millions of years(8). Planets orbiting in these gas disks will accrete(9,10) a large quantity of gas that will transform their primordial atmospheres into new secondary atmospheres with compositions similar to that of the parent gas disk. Here we quantify how large a secondary atmosphere can be created for a variety of observed gas disks and for a wide range of planet types. We find that gas accretion in this late phase is very important and an Earth's atmospheric mass of gas is readily accreted on terrestrial planets in very tenuous gas disks. In slightly more massive disks, we show that massive CO atmospheres can be accreted, forming planets with up to sub-Neptune-like pressures. Our results demonstrate that new secondary atmospheres with high metallicities and high C/O ratios will be created in these late gas disks, resetting their primordial compositions inherited from the protoplanetary disk phase, and providing a new birth to planets that lost their atmosphere to photoevaporation or giant impacts. We therefore propose a new paradigm for the formation of atmospheres on low-mass planets, which can be tested with future observations (James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), Atmospheric Remote-sensing Infrared Exoplanet Large-survey (ARIEL). We also show that this late accretion would show a very clear signature in sub-Neptunes or cold exo-Jupiters. Finally, we find that accretion creates cavities in late gas disks, which could be used as a new planet detection method, for low-mass planets a few to a few tens of astronomical units from their host stars.The exoplanet atmospheres we study may not be primary atmospheres. Models show that the accretion of gas late in a planetary system's formation may completely replace the primary atmospheres of terrestrial planets. These secondary atmospheres are likely to have high metallicities and high C/O ratios."
34,C,"Laboratory experiments show that the inclusion of even small quantities of sulfur in the atmospheres of exoplanets at 800 K significantly increases photochemical complexity, both in the vapour and in the solid phase: many sulfur gas products are created (including potential biosignature gases) and the production of organic haze particles increases threefold. Sulfur gases substantially affect the photochemistry of planetary atmospheres in our Solar System, and are expected to be important components in exoplanet atmospheres. However, sulfur photochemistry in the context of exoplanets is poorly understood due to a lack of chemical kinetics information for sulfur species under relevant conditions. Here, we study the photochemical role of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in warm CO2-rich exoplanet atmospheres (800 K) by carrying out laboratory simulations. We find that H2S plays a prominent role in photochemistry, even when present in the atmosphere at relatively low concentrations (1.6%). It participates in both gas and solid phase chemistry, leading to the formation of other sulfur gas products (CH3SH/SO, C2H4S/OCS, SO2/S-2 and CS2) and to an increase in solid haze particle production and compositional complexity. Our study shows that we may expect thicker haze with small particle sizes (20-140 nm) for warm CO2-rich exoplanet atmospheres that possess H2S."
35,D,"The unfolding COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the vulnerability of the Pacific food system to externalities and has had far-reaching impacts, despite the small number of COVID-19 cases recorded thus far. Measures adopted to mitigate risk from the pandemic have had severe impacts on tourism, remittances, and international trade, among other aspects of the political economy of the region, and are thus impacting on food systems, food security and livelihoods. Of particular concern will be the interplay between loss of incomes and the availability and affordability of local and imported foods. In this paper, we examine some of the key pathways of impact on food systems, and identify opportunities to strengthen Pacific food systems during these challenging times. The great diversity among Pacific Island Countries and Territories in their economies, societies, and agricultural potential will be an important guide to planning interventions and developing scenarios of alternative futures. Bolstering regional production and intraregional trade in a currently import-dependent region could strengthen the regional economy, and provide the health benefits of consuming locally produced and harvested fresh foods - as well as decreasing reliance on global supply chains. However, significant production, processing, and storage challenges remain and would need to be consistently overcome to influence a move away from shelf-stable foods, particularly during periods when human movement is restricted and during post-disaster recovery."
36,D,"Dietary health and sustainability are inextricably linked. Food systems that are not sustainable often fail to provide the amount or types of food needed to ensure population health. The ongoing pandemic threatens to exacerbate malnutrition, and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). This paper discusses threats and opportunities for food environments and health status across the WHO European Region in the current context . These opportunities and threats are focused around four key areas: NCDs and health systems; dietary behaviour; food insecurity and vulnerable groups; and food supply mechanisms. Food systems were already under great stress. Now with the pandemic, the challenges to food systems in the WHO European Region have been exacerbated, demanding from all levels of government swift adaptations to manage healthiness, availability, accessibility and affordability of food. Cities and governments in the Region should capitalize on this unique opportunity to 'build back better' and make bold and lasting changes to the food system and consequently to the health and wellbeing of people and sustainability of the planet."
37,D,"Graduation model programmes deliver a package of support to poor households, including cash and asset transfers, training and coaching, and access to savings facilities. They have been shown to reduce extreme poverty but evidence for their impacts on household food security is limited. Drawing on multiple-round evaluations of graduation projects in Burundi and Rwanda, this paper demonstrates statistically significant impacts on several food security indicators, including months of hunger, meals per day and dietary diversity. Importantly, positive impacts were sustained for households that were re-interviewed 2years after they exited the programme."
38,A,"Our understanding of suicidal ideation (SI) and its risk precursors is largely informed by studies spanning over wide time intervals (weeks, months, years). Little is known about SI as it occurs in daily lives of individuals at risk for suicide, the extent to which suicidal thoughts are dynamic over short periods of time, and the degree to which theoretically informed risk factors predict near-term SI. Thirty-four adolescents hospitalized due to last-month suicide attempt and/or last-week SI (76% female; ages 13-17) responded to daily surveys sent to their cell phones for four consecutive weeks after discharge (n = 652 observations). There was notable variability in day-to-day SI, with half of ideation ratings changing at least one within-person standard deviation from one day to the next. of mixed effects models revealed concurrent (same-day), but not short-term prospective (next-day), associations between SI (frequency, duration, urge) and well-established predictors (connectedness, burdensomeness, hopelessness). However, synergistic effects of low connectedness with either high burdensomeness or high hopelessness were reliably associated with more severe same- and next-day suicidal ideation. This study adds to emerging literature indicating that suicidal thoughts fluctuate considerably among individuals at risk for suicide, further extending it by focusing on adolescents in the critical posthospitalization period. Fostering high-risk adolescents' sense of connectedness to others may be an especially promising intervention target. Frequent assessment of SI and its predictors, independently and in combination, could help identify promising predictors of short-term risk and meaningful intervention targets in high-risk teens."
39,A,"Insomnia has been associated in cross-sectional studies with increased beta (15-35 Hz) electroencephalogram (EEG) power during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, an index of cortical hyperarousal. However, it is unknown whether this cortical hyperarousal is present before individuals with insomnia develop the disorder. To fill this gap, we examined the association of childhood sleep high-frequency EEG activity with incident insomnia symptoms (i.e., absence of insomnia symptoms in childhood but presence in adolescence). We studied a case-control subsample of 45 children (6-11 years) from the Penn State Child Cohort, a population-based random sample of 421 children, who were followed up after 8 years as adolescents (13-20 years). We examined low-beta (15-25 Hz) and high-beta (25-35 Hz) relative power at central EEG derivations during NREM sleep and, in secondary analyses, during sleep onset latency, sleep onset, and REM sleep. Incident insomnia symptoms were defined as the absence of parent-reported difficulty falling and/or staying asleep during childhood and a self-report of these insomnia symptoms during adolescence. Childhood high-beta power during NREM sleep was significantly increased in children who developed insomnia symptoms in adolescence (n = 25) as compared to normal sleeping controls (n = 20; p = .03). Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models showed that increased childhood high-beta EEG power during NREM sleep was associated with a threefold increased odds (95% CI = 1.12-7.98) of incident insomnia symptoms in adolescence. No other significant relationships were observed for other sleep/wake states or EEG frequency bands. Increased childhood high-frequency EEG power during NREM sleep is associated with incident insomnia symptoms in adolescence. This study indicates that cortical hyperarousal during sleep may be a premorbid neurophysiological sign of insomnia, which may mediate the increased risk of psychiatric disorders associated with insomnia."
40,A,"The prenatal period is a period of vulnerability during which neurotoxic exposures exert persistent changes in brain development and behavior. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), used as flame retardants in commercial products, are known to be developmental neurotoxicants. PBDEs were phased out of use in the United States a decade ago, but exposure remains widespread due to their release from existing products and biopersistence. Despite consistent animal and epidemiological evidence of developmental neurotoxicity, the neural substrates linking prenatal PBDE serum concentrations to impaired neurodevelopment are poorly understood. In the present study, we used resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine associations between prenatal PBDE concentrations measured in maternal serum and intrinsic functional network organization (i.e., global and local efficiency; estimated using a graph-theoretical approach) in 5-year-old children (n = 34). We explored whether PBDE serum concentrations were associated with executive functioning (EF) assessed using a parent-report questionnaire (BRIEF-P) (n = 106) and whether changes in intrinsic functional network organization linked the association between prenatal PBDE serum concentrations and EF problems. Children with higher prenatal PBDE serum concentrations showed: (a) increased global efficiency of brain areas involved in visual attention (e.g., inferior occipital gyrus) (beta's = .01, FDR-corrected p's <= .05); (b) more reported EF problems (beta's = .001, FDR-corrected p's <= .05). Higher global efficiency of brain areas involved in visual attention was associated with more EF problems (beta's = .01, FDR-corrected p's < .05). Intrinsic functional network organization of visual attention brain areas linked prenatal PBDE concentrations to EF problems in childhood. Visual attention may contribute to the development of higher-order cognitive functions, such as EF, which could be explored in future studies."
41,A,"Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) experience greater sleep problems than their peers. Although adolescence is generally a developmental period characterized by insufficient sleep, few studies have used a multi-informant, multi-method design, to examine whether sleep differs in adolescents with and without ADHD. Targeted recruitment was used to enroll an approximately equal number of eighth-grade adolescents (mean age = 13 years) with (n = 162) and without ADHD (n = 140). Adolescents and parents completed global ratings of sleep problems; adolescents, parents, and teachers completed ratings of daytime sleepiness. Adolescents wore actigraphs and completed a daily sleep diary for approximately 2 weeks. Adolescents with ADHD were more likely than adolescents without ADHD to obtain insufficient sleep on school days (per diary) and weekends (per diary and actigraphy). Adolescents with ADHD were also more likely to report falling asleep in class and to have stayed up all night at least twice in the previous 2 weeks (14% and 5% reported all-nighters for ADHD and comparison, respectively). In regression analyses controlling for a number of variables known to impact sleep (e.g. pubertal development, sex, medication use, having an externalizing, anxiety, or depression diagnosis), ADHD remained associated with shorter diary and actigraphy school night sleep duration, adolescent- and parent-reported daytime sleepiness, and parent-reported difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep and total sleep disturbance. Controlling for other variables, the odds of being classified with clinically elevated parent-reported sleep disturbance were 6.20 times greater for adolescents with ADHD. Findings provide some of the clearest evidence yet that adolescents with ADHD experience more sleep problems and sleepiness than their peers without ADHD. It may be especially important to assess for sleep problems in adolescents with ADHD and to evaluate whether existing sleep interventions are effective, or can be optimized, for use in adolescents with ADHD who also have sleep problems."
42,A,"Little is known about genetic and environmental influences on the components of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD), tonic irritability (i.e., irritable mood) and phasic irritability (i.e., temper outbursts). This study examined prevalence, stability, and heritability of tonic irritability, phasic irritability, and a DMDD proxy (pDMDD) based on DSM-5 criteria. pDMDD was derived using data from clinical interviews of parents and their twins (N = 1,431 twin pairs), ages 8-17, participating in Waves 1 and 2 of the Virginia Twin Study of Adolescent Behavioral Development. Biometrical modeling was used to compare a common pathway model (CPM) and an independent pathway model (IPM), and heritability estimates were obtained for pDMDD using the symptoms of irritable mood (tonic irritability; DMDD Criterion D), intense temper outbursts (phasic irritability; DMDD Criterion A), and frequent temper outbursts (phasic irritability; DMDD Criterion C). Lifetime prevalence of pDMDD was 7.46%. The stability of DMDD symptoms and the pDMDD phenotype across approximately one year were moderate (.30-.69). A CPM was a better fit to the data than an IPM. Phasic irritability loaded strongly onto the pDMDD latent factor (.89-.96) whereas tonic irritability did not (.28). Genetic influences accounted for approximately 59% of the variance in the latent pDMDD phenotype, with the remaining 41% of the variance due to unique environmental effects. The heritability of tonic irritability (54%) was slightly lower than that of frequent and intense temper (components of phasic irritability; 61% and 63%, respectively). Compared to tonic irritability, phasic irritability appears to be slightly more stable and heritable, as well as a stronger indicator of the latent factor. Furthermore, environmental experiences appear to play a substantial role in the development of irritability and DMDD, and researchers should seek to elucidate these mechanisms in future work."
43,A,"Early adversity consistently predicts youth psychopathology. However, the pathways linking unique dimensions of early adversity, such as deprivation, to psychopathology are understudied. Here, we evaluate a theoretical model linking early deprivation exposure with psychopathology prospectively through language ability. Participants included 2,301 youth (47.5% female) enrolled in the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study. We include data from assessment points at ages 1, 3, 5, 9, and 15. Latent factors for deprivation and threat were modeled from multiple indicators at ages 1 and 3. Youth language ability was assessed at Age 5. Indicators of psychopathology were assessed at ages 5, 9, and 15. A structural equation model tested longitudinal paths to internalizing and externalizing psychopathology from experiences of deprivation and threat. Deprivation from birth to Age 3 was associated with an indirect effect on internalizing and externalizing symptoms in early childhood (Age 5), later childhood (Age 9), and adolescence (Age 15) via language ability in early childhood (Age 5). Early threat exposure was associated with increased internalizing and externalizing psychopathology across all ages. There was no significant indirect effect from threat to psychopathology via language ability. The effects of deprivation on psychopathology during early childhood, late childhood, and adolescence are explained, in part, through early childhood language ability. provide insight into language ability as a possible opportunity for intervention."
44,A,"Psychotic experiences are common in childhood and an important risk indicator of adverse mental health outcomes. However, little is known about the association of psychotic experiences with functional outcomes in childhood, particularly regarding school performance. The aim of the present study was to examine whether psychotic experiences were prospectively related to school performance in childhood. This study was embedded in the population-based Generation R Study (N = 2,362). Psychotic experiences were assessed using self-reports on hallucinations at age 10 years. School performance was assessed using a standardized national school performance test at age 12 years. We considered the total school performance score, as well as language and mathematics subscales. Analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, maternal nonverbal IQ, nonverbal IQ at age 6 years and co-occurring psychopathology at age 10 years. Psychotic experiences were prospectively associated with poorer school performance scores (B = -0.61, 95% CI [-0.98;-0.25],p = .001), as well as poorer language (B-percentile rank score = -2.00, 95% CI [-3.20;-0.79],p = .001) and mathematical ability (B-percentile rank score = -1.75, 95% CI [-2.99;-0.51],p = .006). These associations remained after additional adjustment for nonverbal IQ at age 6 years (B = -0.51, 95% CI [-0.86;-0.16],p = .005), and co-occurring internalizing (B = -0.40, 95% CI [-0.77;-0.03],p = .036) and externalizing problems (B = -0.40, 95% CI [-0.75;-0.04],p = .029), but not attention problems (B = -0.10, 95% CI [-0.47;0.26],p = .57). Children with psychotic experiences had lower school performance scores than their nonaffected peers. The finding was independent of sociodemographic characteristics, intelligence and co-occurring internalizing and externalizing problems, but not attention problems. This study suggests that psychotic experiences are associated with childhood functional impairments, although the relatively small effects and the role of attention problems warrant further exploration."
45,A,"Internet gaming disorder (IGD) is highlighted as a condition for further study in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM-5). Some studies indicate that IGD appears comorbid with other psychiatric disorders. We examine concurrent and prospective links between symptoms of IGD and symptoms of common psychiatric disorders in childhood and adolescence to determine whether observed comorbidity is a result of (a) reciprocal relations or (b) common underlying causes. A community sample (n = 702) of Norwegian children completed the Internet Gaming Disorder Interview (IGDI) to assess DSM-5 defined IGD symptoms at ages 10, 12 and 14 years. The Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment (CAPA) assessed symptoms of depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD) at the same time points. A Random Intercept Cross-lagged Panel Model (RI-CLPM), which captures pure within-person changes and adjusts for all unmeasured time-invariant factors (e.g., genetics, parent education) revealed no associations between IGD symptoms and psychopathology, except that increased IGD symptoms at ages 10 and 12 predicted decreased symptoms of anxiety two years later. No support emerged for concurrent or prospective relations between IGD and psychiatric symptoms, except in one case: increased IGD symptoms forecasted reduction in anxiety symptoms. Observed co-occurrence between IGD symptoms and mental health problems can mainly be attributed to common underlying factors."
46,A,"Cross-sectional associations have been documented between cybervictimization and suicidal risk; however, prospective associations remain unclear. Participants were members of the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development (QLSCD), a prospective birth cohort of 2,120 individuals followed from birth (1997/98) to age 17 years (2014/15).Cybervictimization and face-to-face victimization experienced since the beginning of the school year, as well as serious suicidal ideation and/or suicide attempt were self-reported at ages 13, 15 and 17 years. In cross-sectional analyses at 13, 15 and 17 years, adolescents cybervictimized at least once had, respectively, 2.3 (95% CI = 1.64-3.19), 4.2 (95% CI = 3.27-5.41) and 3.5 (95% CI = 2.57-4.66) higher odds of suicidal ideation/attempt after adjusting for confounders including face-to-face victimization, prior mental health symptoms and family hardship. Sensitivity analyses suggested that cybervictimization only and both cyber- and face-to-face victimization were associated with a higher risk of suicidal ideation/attempt compared to face-to-face victimization only and no victimization; however, analyses were based on small n. In prospective analyses, cybervictimization was not associated with suicidal ideation/attempt 2 years later after accounting for baseline suicidal ideation/attempt and other confounders. In contrast, face-to-face victimization was associated with suicidal ideation/attempt 2 years later in the fully adjusted model, including cybervictimization. The cross-sectional association between cybervictimization and suicidal ideation/attempt is independent from face-to-face victimization. The absence of a prospective association suggested short-term effects of cybervictimization on suicidal ideation/attempt."
47,A,"Leaving infant to cry it out has been the subject of discussion among researchers and parents. Nevertheless, there is paucity of empirical research investigating the association between leaving infant to cry it out and consequent crying duration and frequency, mother-infant attachment and behavioural development. The sample with complete longitudinal data comprised 178 infants and their caretakers. Parental use of 'leaving infant to cry out' and cry duration were assessed with maternal report at term, 3, 6 and 18 months, and frequency of crying was assessed at term, 3 and 18 months of age. Attachment was measured at 18 months using the strange situation procedure. Behavioural development of the infant was assessed with two observational measures and a parent-report questionnaire at 18 months. The use of 'leaving infant to crying' was rare at term and increased over the next 18 months. 'Leaving infants to cry it out' at term was associated with a decrease in crying frequency at 3 months. Furthermore, leaving infants to cry it out a few times at term and often at 3 months was associated with shorter fuss/cry duration at 18 months of age. No adverse impacts of leaving infants to cry it out in the first 6 months on infant-mother attachment and behavioural development at 18 months were found. Contemporary practice of some parents in the United Kingdom to occasionally or often 'leaving infant to cry it out' during the first 6 months was not associated with adverse behavioural development and attachment at 18 months. Increased use of 'leaving to cry it out' with age may indicate differential responding by parents related to infant self-regulation."
48,A,"Children adopted from orphanages or other such institutions tend to display blunted reactivity to stressors - even years after arriving in their generally supportive and highly resourced postadoption homes. Puberty, a proposed sensitive period for environmental influences on stress-mediating systems, may provide an opportunity for postinstitutionalized children to recalibrate stress response systems in accordance with their now more supportive living situations. This cross-sectional study examined the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA)-axis reactivity of 280 children ages 7 through 14 years; 122 children were adopted from institutions in 14 countries between the ages of 6 months and 5 years, after spending an average of 95% of their lives in institutional care, and 158 children of similarly high socioeconomic status in their biological families served as the nonadopted comparison group. All of the children were assessed by nurses for Tanner stage and, on a different day, completed the Trier Social Stress Test for Children. Using a linear mixed-effects model and seven measures of salivary cortisol, results indicated that early-pubertal postinstitutionalized children showed blunted HPA axis reactivity compared to nonadopted children, but mid/late-pubertal postinstitutionalized children displayed higher reactivity similar to the nonadopted comparison children. This is the first evidence of possible pubertal recalibration of HPA axis reactivity to a psychosocial stressor in postinstitutionalized children, which provides a promising avenue for future research regarding the protective factors of the postadoption environment and subsequent physiological, behavioral, and psychopathological outcomes."
49,C,"Dark matter cannot be observed directly, but its weak gravitational lensing slightly distorts the apparent shapes of background galaxies, making weak lensing one of the most promising probes of cosmology. Several observational studies have measured the effect, and there are currently running(1,2) and planned efforts(3,4) to provide even larger and higher-resolution weak lensing maps. Owing to nonlinearities on small scales, the traditional analysis with two-point statistics does not fully capture all of the underlying informations(5). Multiple inference methods have been proposed to extract more details based on higher-order statistics(6,7), peak statisticss(8-13), Minkowski functionals(14-16) and recently convolutional neural networks(17,18). Here we present an improved convolutional neural network that gives significantly better estimates of the Omega(m) and sigma(8) cosmological parameters from simulated weak lensing convergence maps than state-of-art methods and that is also free of systematic bias. We show that the network exploits information in the gradients around peaks, and with this insight we have constructed an easy-to-understand and robust peak-counting algorithm based on the steepness of peaks, instead of their heights. The proposed scheme is even more accurate than the neural network on high-resolution noiseless maps. With shape noise and lower resolution, its relative advantage deteriorates, but it remains more accurate than peak counting."
50,A,"Children with developmental disabilities are at heightened risk for maltreatment. However, little is known regarding the prevalence of maltreatment among specific groups, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and/or intellectual disability (ID). Information about maltreatment in these groups can aid in the development of supports and prevention strategies for vulnerable children and their families. Using record linkage between the Department of Social Services (DSS) and the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) network, this study compares the prevalence and characteristics of maltreatment among children with ASD-only (n = 316), ASD and comorbid ID (ASD+ID; n = 291), ID-only (n = 1,280), and controls (n = 3,101). Behavioral correlates of maltreatment are examined. Controlling for demographic factors, this study found significantly higher odds of reported and substantiated maltreatment among children with ASD-only (odds ratio = 1.86 for reported, 1.51 for substantiated), ASD+ID (odds ratio = 2.35 for reported, 1.97 for substantiated), and ID-only (odds ratio = 2.45 for reported, 2.49 for substantiated) relative to a population control group, with large effects. In particular, children with ASD+ID and ID-only were between two and three times more likely to experience maltreatment. All groups were more likely to experience physical neglect, and children in the ASD+ID and ID-only groups were more likely to experience all forms of abuse. Children in the ASD-only group were more likely to experience physical abuse. Maltreated children in the ASD-only and ID-only groups experienced more cases of physical abuse and neglect, and were victimized by more perpetrators compared to other maltreated youth. Maltreatment was associated with higher likelihood of aggression, hyperactivity, and tantrums for children with ASD. Children with ASD and/or ID are at heightened risk for maltreatment. Empirically-supported assessment and intervention approaches for identifying and addressing traumatic stress related to maltreatment in ASD are urgently needed."
51,B,"In July of 2019, the U.S. Senate gave advice and consent to protocols updating tax treaties with Spain, Switzerland, Japan, and Luxembourg, after a nearly decade-long period during which no tax treaties were approved by the Senate. This drought was primarily due to the privacy concerns of a single senator, Rand Paul of Kentucky, who deployed the Senate's procedural rules to increase the difficulty of the advice and consent process. Tax treaties with Hungary, Chile, and Poland, as well as a protocol to a multilateral tax convention, remained pending in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee as of mid-August of 2019."

53,A,"Williams syndrome (WS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that has been attributed to heterozygous deletions in chromosome 7q11.23 and exhibits a variety of physical, cognitive, and behavioral features. However, the genetic basis of this phenotypic variability is unclear. In this study, we identified genetic clues underlying these complex phenotypes. Neurobehavioral function was assessed in WS patients and healthy controls. Total RNA was extracted from peripheral blood and subjected to microarray analysis, RNA-sequencing, and qRT-PCR. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was performed to identify specific alterations related to intermediate disease phenotypes. To functionally interpret each WS-related module, gene ontology and disease-related gene enrichment were examined. We also investigated the micro (mi)RNA expression profiles and miRNA co-expression networks to better explain the regulation of the transcriptome in WS. Our analysis identified four significant co-expression modules related to intermediate WS phenotypes. Notably, the three upregulated WS-related modules were composed exclusively of genes located outside the 7q11.23 region. They were significantly enriched in genes related to B-cell activation, RNA processing, and RNA transport. BCL11A, which is known for its association with speech disorders and intellectual disabilities, was identified as one of the hub genes in the top WS-related module. Finally, these key upregulated mRNA co-expression modules appear to be inversely correlated with a specific downregulated WS-related miRNA co-expression module. Dysregulation of the mRNA/miRNA network involving genes outside of the 7q11.23 region is likely related to the complex phenotypes observed in WS patients."
54,A,"Children with the temperament of behavioral inhibition (BI) face increased risk for social anxiety. However, not all children with BI develop anxiety symptoms. Inhibitory control (IC) has been suggested as a moderator of the pathway between BI and social anxiety. This study uses longitudinal data to characterize development of IC and tests the hypothesis that IC moderates associations between early BI and later social anxiety symptoms. Children completed a Go/Nogo task at ages 5, 7, and 10 years as part of a longitudinal study of BI (measured at 2-3 years) and social anxiety symptoms (measured at 12 years). To assess IC development, response strategy (criterion) and inhibitory performance (d ') were characterized using signal detection theory. Latent growth models were used to characterize the development of IC and examine relations among BI, IC parameters, and social anxiety symptoms. IC response strategy did not change between 5 and 10 years of age, whereas IC performance improved over time. BI scores in toddlerhood predicted neither initial levels (intercept) nor changes (slope) in IC response strategy or IC performance. However, between ages 5 and 10, rate of change in IC performance, but not response strategy, moderated relations between BI and later parent-reported social anxiety symptoms. Specifically, greater age-related improvements in IC performance predicted higher levels of social anxiety in high BI children. IC development in childhood occurs independent of BI levels. However, rapid increases in IC performance moderate risk for social anxiety symptoms in children with BI. Implications for theory and practice are discussed."
55,A,"Callous-Unemotional (CU) and psychopathic traits are consistently associated with impaired recognition of others' emotions, specifically fear and sadness. However, no studies have examined whether the association between CU traits and emotion recognition deficits is due primarily to genetic or environmental factors. The current study used data from 607 Caucasian twin pairs (N = 1,214 twins) to examine the phenotypic and genetic relationship between the Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits (ICU) and facial emotion recognition assessed via the laboratory-based Facial Expression Labeling Task (FELT). The uncaring/callous dimension of the ICU was significantly associated with impaired recognition of happiness, sadness, fear, surprise, and disgust. The unemotional ICU dimension was significantly associated with improved recognition of surprise and disgust. Total ICU score was significantly associated with impaired recognition of sadness. Significant genetic correlations were found for uncaring/callous traits and distress cue recognition (i.e. fear and sadness). The observed relationship between uncaring/callous traits and deficits in distress cue recognition was accounted for entirely by shared genetic influences. The results of the current study replicate previous findings demonstrating impaired emotion recognition among youth with elevated CU traits. We extend these findings by replicating them in an epidemiological sample not selected or enriched for pathological levels of CU traits. Furthermore, the current study is the first to investigate the genetic and environmental etiology of CU traits and emotion recognition, and results suggest genetic influences underlie the specific relationship between uncaring/callous traits and distress cue (fear/sadness) recognition in others."
56,A,"Current theories in neuroscience emphasize the crucial role of individual differences in the brain contributing to the development of risk taking during adolescence. Yet, little is known about developmental pathways through which family risk factors are related to neural processing of risk during decision making, ultimately contributing to health risk behaviors. Using a longitudinal design, we tested whether neural risk processing, as affected by family multi-risk index, predicted delay discounting and substance use. Method One hundred and fifty-seven adolescents (aged 13-14 years at Time 1, 52% male) were assessed annually three times. Family multi-risk index was measured by socioeconomic adversity, household chaos, and family risk-taking behaviors. Delay discounting was assessed by a computerized task, substance use by questionnaire data, and risk-related neural processing by blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) responses in the amygdala during a lottery choice task. Family multi-risk index at Time 1 was related to adolescent substance use at Time 3 (after controlling for baseline substance use) indirectly through heightened amygdala sensitivity to risks and greater delay discounting. Our results elucidate the crucial role of neural risk processing in the processes linking family multi-risk index and the development of substance use. Furthermore, risk-related amygdala activation and delay discounting are important targets in the prevention and treatment of substance use among adolescents growing up in high-risk family environments."
57,A,"Prenatal exposure to maternal adverse life events has been associated with offspring ADHD, but the role of familial confounding is unclear. We aimed to clarify if adverse life events during pregnancy are related to ADHD symptoms in offspring, taking shared familial factors into account. Method Data were collected on 34,751 children (including 6,427 siblings) participating in the population-based Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study. During pregnancy, mothers reported whether they had experienced specific life events. We assessed ADHD symptoms in five-year-old children with the Conners' Parent Rating Scale-Revised: short form. We modeled the associations between life events and mean ADHD scores with ordinary linear regression in the full cohort, and with fixed-effect linear regression in sibling comparisons to adjust for familial confounding. Children exposed to adverse life events had higher ADHD scores at age 5, with the strongest effect observed for financial problems (mean differences 0.10 [95% CI: 0.09, 0.11] in adjusted model), and the weakest for having lost someone close (0.02 [95% CI 0.01, 0.04] in adjusted model). Comparing exposure-discordant siblings resulted in attenuated estimates that were no longer statistically significant (e.g. mean difference for financial problems -0.03 [95% CI -0.07, 0.02]). ADHD scores increased if the mother had experienced the event as painful or difficult, and with the number of events, whereas sibling-comparison analyses resulted in estimates attenuated toward the null. These results suggest that the association between adverse life events during pregnancy and offspring ADHD symptoms is largely explained by familial factors."
58,A,"Cross-sectional associations between anxiety disorders and eating disorders (EDs) have been well documented; however, limited research has examined whether symptoms of anxiety disorders are prospectively associated with EDs. Identifying these longitudinal associations can aid in discerning relationships among eating and anxiety disorders and point toward a mechanistic understanding of developmental psychopathology. This study investigated the prospective associations between parent-reported anxiety in mid-childhood (age 10) and child-reported ED behaviors and disorders in adolescence (at ages 14 and 16 years) in a population-based sample. Participants were individuals enrolled in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a population-based, prospective study of women and their children; 7,767 children whose parents provided data at age 10 were included in current analyses. An exploratory factor analysis identified latent anxiety factors at age 10, followed by a path analysis that evaluated associations between these factors and eating disorder symptoms and cognitions at age 14. Parent-reported anxiety symptoms at age 10 yielded 5 factors: obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms related to symmetry and checking (Factor 1); OCD symptoms associated with aversion to dirt and germs (Factor 2); physical anxiety symptoms (Factor 3); worries (Factor 4); and social phobia symptoms (Factor 5). Factors 3 and 4 showed the most consistent, positive associations with a range of ED symptoms at age 14. Factor 3 predicted diagnosis of bulimia nervosa by age 16 (OR = 1.11, p = .007), whereas Factor 4 predicted diagnoses of anorexia nervosa (OR = 1.10, p = .01) and disordered eating by age 16 (OR = 1.08, p = .001). indicate that symptoms of generalized anxiety in middle childhood may predict adolescent-onset ED symptoms and ED diagnoses."
59,A,"Childhood maltreatment is one of the most potent predictors of future psychopathology, including internalizing disorders. It remains unclear whether heightened amygdala reactivity to threat and elevated stress exposure may be implicated in the pathogenesis and maintenance of internalizing disorders among individuals with a history of childhood maltreatment. Using data from a sample of 1,144 young adults, we investigated the contribution of baseline threat-related amygdala reactivity and prospective major stressful life events to internalizing symptoms severity 1 year later (on average) in individuals with a history of maltreatment (n = 100) and propensity score matched nonmaltreated peers (n = 96). Even after stringently matching for several potentially confounding variables - including baseline internalizing symptoms, socioeconomic status and IQ - childhood maltreatment status predicted increased amygdala reactivity at baseline, elevated post-baseline exposure to major stressful life events and internalizing symptoms at follow-up. We also showed, for the first time, that amygdala reactivity at baseline and also post-baseline exposure to major stressful life events mediated the association between a history of maltreatment and future internalizing symptoms. These findings provide support for the view that maltreatment is a potent developmental insult leading to long-lasting neurocognitive recalibrations of the threat processing system. It is possible that such alterations, over time, may impact mental health functioning by compromising the ability to effectively negotiate everyday challenges (stress susceptibility). These alterations were not, however, found to sensitize an individual to the impact of major stressful life events. The results of this study also lend compelling support to the view that increased psychiatric risk, in the context of childhood maltreatment, follows from an increased propensity to experience major stressful life events (stress generation)."
60,A,"ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a complex pathogenesis. Individual differences in temperamental reactivity - in particular, anger reactivity - are predictive of ADHD. The goal of this study was to examine the moderating (maternal caregiving behaviors; MCB) and mediating (inhibitory control) variables of reactivity using a 9-year multimethod prospective longitudinal design. Participants included 291 children (135 male; 156 female) who participated in a larger study of temperament and social-emotional development. Anger reactivity was assessed by observation of facial anger during an arm restraint task, and MCB were observed during a series of semi-structured mother-infant tasks, both at 9 months of age. Inhibitory control was assessed by performance on a go/no-go task at 5 years of age. ADHD symptoms were assessed by parent and teacher report questionnaires at 7 and 9 years, respectively. Anger reactivity and poor inhibitory control were predictive of later ADHD symptoms. supported a moderated mediation model, in which the indirect effects of anger reactivity on ADHD symptoms through inhibitory control were conditional on quality of early MCB. Inhibitory control mediated the effect of anger reactivity on ADHD symptoms, but only among children exposed to lower-quality MCB. Infant anger reactivity exerts a direct effect on later ADHD from infancy, suggesting anger reactivity as a very early indicator of ADHD risk. Higher-quality caregiving did not buffer against the direct risk of anger reactivity on ADHD but did buffer against the indirect risk by reducing the negative effect of anger reactivity on inhibitory control. Thus, in the developmental pathway from anger reactivity to ADHD, more sensitive, less intrusive parenting supports the development of protective mechanisms (i.e. inhibitory control) to remediate ADHD risk."
61,A,"Psychotic experiences (PEs) such as paranoia and hallucinations, and negative symptoms (NS) such as anhedonia and flat affect are common in adolescence. Psychotic experiences and negative symptoms (PENS) increase risk for later psychiatric outcomes, particularly when they persist. The extent to which genetic and environmental influences contribute to the stability of PENS in mid-to-late adolescence is unknown. Using the Specific Psychotic Experiences Questionnaire (SPEQ) twice across similar to 9 months in adolescence, N = 1,448 twin pairs [M = 16.32 (0.68)] reported experiences of paranoia, hallucinations, cognitive disorganization, grandiosity and anhedonia, and their parents reported on a range of NS. Individuals were split into low-scoring, decreasing, increasing and persistent groups for each subscale. Frequencies and mean differences in distress, depression traits and emotional problems were investigated across groups. Longitudinal structural equation modelling was used to estimate the aetiological components underlying the stability of PENS. Phenotypic stability was moderate for all PENS (r = .59-.69). Persistent PENS across 9 months were associated with greater levels of distress (V = 0.15-0.46, for PEs only), depression traits (d = 0.47-1.67, except grandiosity) and emotional problems (d = 0.47-1.47, except grandiosity and anhedonia) at baseline compared to groups with transitory or low levels of PENS. At both ages PENS were heritable and influenced by shared and nonshared environment. Genetic influences contributed 38%-62% and shared environment contributed 13%-33% to the stability of PENS. Nonshared environment contributed 34%-41% (12% for parent-rated NS). There was strong overlap of genetic and shared environmental influences across time, and lower overlap for nonshared environment. Imperfect stability of PENS was at least partly due to nonshared environmental influences. When adolescent PENS persist over time, they are often characterized by more distress, and higher levels of other psychopathology. Both genetic and environmental effects influence stability of PENS."
62,A,"This study examined associations between permissive parenting, deviant peer affiliations, and externalizing behavior across mid to late adolescence in a plausible indirect effects model of change over time with deviant peer affiliation serving as the mediator. We also evaluated potential conditional indirect effects wherein these relationships may be moderated by sex and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity, indexed by skin conductance level (SCL) reactivity. Method Participants included 242 community-sampled adolescents (M = 15.79 years; 48% boys; 66% European American, 34% African American) with two additional longitudinal assessments lagged by 1 year. Permissive parenting, SCL reactivity, and sex were considered as time invariant predictors of repeated measures of deviant peer affiliation and externalizing behavior in latent growth models that tested whether any of the direct or indirect associations were conditional on sex or SCL reactivity. Evidence was found for indirect effects of permissive parenting on externalizing behavior via deviant peer affiliation, but only for males with lower SCL reactivity to stress. Additionally, these effects were found on latent intercepts, but not slopes indexing change over time, perhaps reflecting established individual differences in relationships among these variables. Findings are discussed in the context of biosocial models of adolescent development and risk factors that may inform interventions for vulnerable youth."
63,A,"Immune system dysfunction may be associated with eating disorders (ED) and could have implications for detection, risk assessment, and treatment of both autoimmune diseases and EDs. However, questions regarding the nature of the relationship between these two disease entities remain. We evaluated the strength of associations for the bidirectional relationships between EDs and autoimmune diseases. In this nationwide population-based study, Swedish registers were linked to establish a cohort of more than 2.5 million individuals born in Sweden between January 1, 1979 and December 31, 2005 and followed up until December 2013. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to investigate: (a) subsequent risk of EDs in individuals with autoimmune diseases; and (b) subsequent risk of autoimmune diseases in individuals with EDs. We observed a strong, bidirectional relationship between the two illness classes indicating that diagnosis in one illness class increased the risk of the other. In women, the diagnoses of autoimmune disease increased subsequent hazards of anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and other eating disorders (OED). Similarly, AN, BN, and OED increased subsequent hazards of autoimmune diseases.Gastrointestinal-related autoimmune diseases such as, celiac disease and Crohn's disease showed a bidirectional relationship with AN and OED. Psoriasis showed a bidirectional relationship with OED. The previous occurence of type 1 diabetes increased the risk for AN, BN, and OED. In men, we did not observe a bidirectional pattern, but prior autoimmune arthritis increased the risk for OED. The interactions between EDs and autoimmune diseases support the previously reported associations. The bidirectional risk pattern observed in women suggests either a shared mechanism or a third mediating variable contributing to the association of these illnesses."
64,A,"Child mental health problems are common. Previous studies have examined secular changes in their prevalence but have not assessed whether later outcomes have changed. We therefore aimed to test whether outcomes of child mental health problems have changed over a 40-year period. Three cohorts were utilized: The National Child Development Study (NCDS: N = 14,544, aged 7 in 1965), the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC: N = 8,188, aged 7 in 1998), and the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS: N = 13,192, aged 7 in 2008). Mental health problems at age 7 were identified using the parent-reported Rutter-A scale (NCDS) and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (ALSPAC and MCS). Associated outcomes were compared across cohorts: age 11 social functioning, age 16 exam attainment and age 16 mental health. Child mental health problems were common in each cohort (boys: 7.0%-9.7%; girls: 5.4%-8.4%). Child mental health problems became more strongly associated with social functioning problems (boys: NCDS OR = 1.95 (1.50, 2.53), MCS OR = 3.77 (2.89, 4.92); interaction p NCDS OR = 1.69 (1.22, 2.33), MCS OR = 3.99 (3.04, 5.25), interaction p < .001), lower academic attainment for boys (NCDS OR = 0.49 (0.31, 0.78), ALSPAC OR = 0.30 (0.22, 0.41), interaction p = .009), and age 16 mental health problems (boys: NCDS d ' = 0.55 (0.38, 0.72), ALSPAC d ' = 0.95 (0.73, 1.16); interaction p = .004; girls: NCDS d ' = 0.50 (0.34, 0.65), ALSPAC d ' = 0.99 (0.78, 1.20); interaction p < .001). Child mental health problems have become more strongly associated with negative social, educational and mental health outcomes in recent generations."
65,A,"A recent genome-wide association study identified molecular-genetic associations with age-at-first-birth. However, the meaning of these genetic discoveries is unclear. Drawing on evidence linking early pregnancy with disinhibitory behavior, we tested the hypothesis that genetic discoveries for age-at-first-birth predict disinhibition. We included participants with genotype data from the two-decade-long Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Study (N = 1,999) and the four-decade-long Dunedin Study (N = 918). We calculated a genome-wide polygenic score for age-at-first-birth and tested whether it was associated with a range of disinhibitory outcomes across the life course, including low childhood self-control; risk for externalizing psychopathology; officially recorded criminal offending; substance dependence; informant reports of disinhibitory problems; and number of lifetime sexual partners. We further tested whether associations were attributable to accelerated pubertal maturation. In both cohorts, the age-at-first-birth polygenic score predicted low childhood self-control, externalizing psychopathology, officially recorded criminal offending, substance dependence, and number of sexual partners. Associations were modest, but robust across replication. Childhood disinhibition partly mediated associations between the polygenic score and reproductive behaviors. In contrast, associations were not attributable to accelerated pubertal timing. Genomic discoveries for age-at-first-birth are about more than reproductive biology: They provide insight into the disinhibitory traits and behaviors that accompany early parenthood. Age-at-first-birth is a useful proxy phenotype for researchers interested in disinhibition. Further, interventions that improve self-regulation abilities may benefit young parents and their children."
66,A,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is likely to have negative health consequences way beyond those caused by the virus per se - including significant psychological distress. Children and adolescents who already live with a mental illness may be particularly vulnerable to the distress associated with the pandemic - due to, for example, fear of the virus as well as the significant societal changes launched to minimize spread of the virus (social distancing and quarantine). In this editorial perspective, we (a) provide data on COVID-19 pandemic-related psychopathology in children and adolescents from a large psychiatric treatment setting in Denmark, (b) give advice on how the likely harmful effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of children and adolescents may be minimized, and (c) propose six lines of research into pandemic-related psychopathology with emphasis on children and adolescents. Finally, we underline the necessity of politicians, health authorities, and funding bodies supporting these research initiatives here and now."
67,A,"Concerns have been raised regarding the potential negative impacts of parents' smartphone use on the parent-child relationship. A scoping literature review indicated inconsistent effects, arguably attributable to different conceptualizations of parent phone use and conflation of phone use with technological interference. Based on a sample ofn = 3, 659 parents collected in partnership with a national public broadcaster, we conducted a multiverse analysis. We explored 84 different analytic choices to address whether associations were weak versus robust, and provide clearer direction for measurement, theory, and practice. Effects were assessed in relation topvalues, effect sizes, and AIC; we further conducted a meta-analytic sensitivity check. Direct associations between smartphone use and parenting were relatively weak and mixed. Instead, the relation between use and parenting depended on level of technological interference. This pattern was particularly robust for family displacement. At low levels of displacing time with family using technology, more smartphone use was associated withbetter(not worse) parenting. Our results indicate fragility in findings of risks for parental smartphone use on parenting; there were few concerns in this regard. Rather, at low levels of technological interference, more phone use was associated with higher parenting quality. Scholars should avoid generalized narratives of family risk and seek to uncover real effects of smartphone use on family outcomes across diverse households and contexts."
68,A,"Adversity experiences (AEs) are major risk factors for psychiatric illness, and ample evidence suggests that adversity-related changes in brain structure enhance this vulnerability. To achieve greater understanding of the underlying biological pathways, increased convergence among findings is needed. Suggested future directions may benefit from the use of large population samples which may contribute to achieving this goal. We addressed mechanistic pathways by investigating the associations between multiple brain phenotypes and retrospectively reported AEs in early life (child adversity) and adulthood (partner abuse) in a large population sample, using a cross-sectional approach. The UK Biobank resource was used to access imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs) from 6,751 participants (aged:M = 62.1,SD = 7.2, range = 45-80), together with selected reports of childhood AEs and adult partner abuse. Principal component analysis was used to reduce the dimensionality of the data prior to multivariate tests. The data showed that participants who reported experiences of childhood emotional abuse ('felt hated by family member as a child') had smaller cerebellar and ventral striatum volumes. This result was also depicted in a random subset of participants; however, we note small effect sizes (eta p2( )< .01), suggestive of modest biological changes. Using a large population cohort, this study demonstrates the value of big datasets in the study of adversity and using automatically preprocessed neuroimaging phenotypes. While retrospective and cross-sectional characteristics limit interpretation, this study demonstrates that self-perceived adversity reports, however nonspecific, may still expose neural consequences, identifiable with increased statistical power."
69,A,"Background: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorder sharing genetic risk factors with other common psychiatric disorders. However, intergenerational recurrence patterns of ADHD from parents to sons and daughters are not known. We aimed to examine the risk of ADHD in offspring of parents with ADHD and parents with other psychiatric disorders by parental and offspring sex, using parents without the specific disorders as comparison. Methods: In a generation study linking data from several population-based registries, all Norwegians born 1967-2011 (n = 2,486,088; Medical Birth Registry of Norway) and their parents were followed to 2015. To estimate intergenerational recurrence risk, we calculated prevalence differences (PD) and the relative risk (RR) of ADHD in offspring by parental ADHD, bipolar disorder (BD), schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SCZ), major depression (MDD), all by parental and offspring sex. Results: The absolute prevalence of ADHD in offspring of parents with ADHD was very high, especially in sons of two affected parents (41.5% and 25.1% in sons and daughters, respectively), and far higher than in offspring of parents with BD, SCZ or MDD. Intergenerational recurrence risks were higher for maternal than paternal ADHD (RRmaternal 8.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 8.2-8.6 vs. RRpaternal 6.2, 6.0-6.4) and this was also true on the absolute scale (PDmaternal 21.1% (20.5-21.7) vs. PDpaternal 14.8% (14.3-15.4)). RRs were higher in daughters, while PDs higher in sons. Parental SCZ, BD and MDD were associated with an approximately doubled risk of offspring ADHD compared to parents without the respective disorders, and estimates did not differ significantly between daughters and sons. Conclusions: The intergenerational recurrence risks of ADHD were high and higher from mothers with ADHD than fathers with ADHD. Other parental psychiatric disorders also conferred increased risk of offspring ADHD, but far lower, indicating a sex- and diagnosis-specific intergenerational recurrence risk in parents with ADHD."
70,A,"Early regulatory problems (RPs) are associated with childhood internalising and externalising symptoms. Internalising and externalising symptoms, in turn, are associated with adolescent psychopathology (e.g. personality disorders, depression). We examined whether RPs are directly associated with adolescent psychopathology, or whether associations are indirect via childhood internalising and externalising symptoms. We used data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Mothers reported on their child's RPs at 6, 15-18 and 24-30 months, and internalising and externalising symptoms at 4, 7, 8 and 9.5 years. Adolescent psychotic, depression and BPD symptoms were assessed at 11-12 years. Children were grouped by their patterns of co-developing internalising and externalising symptoms using parallel process latent class growth analysis (PP-LCGA). Path analysis was used to examine direct and indirect associations from RPs to the three adolescent outcomes. There were four groups of children with distinct patterns of co-developing internalising and externalising (INT/EXT) symptoms. Most children (53%) demonstrated low-moderate and stable levels of INT/EXT symptoms. A small proportion (7.7%) evidenced moderate and increasing INT and high stable EXT symptoms: this pattern was strongly predictive of adolescent psychopathology (e.g. depression at 11 years: unadjusted odds ratio = 5.62; 95% confidence intervals = 3.82, 8.27). The other two groups were differentially associated with adolescent outcomes (i.e. moderate-high increasing INT/moderate decreasing EXT predicted mother-reported depression at 12, while low stable INT/moderate-high stable EXT predicted child-reported depression at 11). In path analysis, RPs at each time-point were significantly indirectly associated with symptoms of BPD and child- and mother-reported depression symptoms via the most severe class of INT/EXT symptoms. Consistent with a cascade model of development, RPs are predictive of higher levels of co-developing INT/EXT symptoms, which in turn increase risk of adolescent psychopathology. Clinicians should be aware of, and treat, early RPs to prevent chronic psychopathology."

72,A,"Anxiety in parents is associated with anxiety in offspring, although little is known about the mechanisms underpinning these intergenerational associations. We conducted the first genetically sensitive study to simultaneously examine the effects of mother, father and child anxiety symptoms on each other over time. Method Adoptive parent and child symptoms were measured at child ages 6, 7 and 8 years from 305 families involved in the Early Growth and Development Study, using a prospective adoption design. Children were adopted at birth to nonrelatives, and composite data on internalising problems within birth families were used as a proxy measure of offspring inherited risk for anxiety. Structural equation models were fitted to the data to examine prospective associations between adoptive mother, father and child symptoms, whilst accounting for individuals' symptom stability over time. Child anxiety symptoms at age 7 predicted adoptive mothers' anxiety symptoms at age 8. No mother-to-child or child-to-father effects were observed. These results were consistent in sensitivity analyses using only paternal offspring reports and using a second measure of child anxiety symptoms. Fathers' anxiety symptoms at child age 6 prospectively predicted child symptoms, but only when paternal offspring reports were included in the model. Composite data on birth family internalising problems were not associated with child anxiety symptoms. show environmentally mediated associations between parent and child anxiety symptoms. support developmental theories suggesting that child anxiety symptoms can exert influence on caregivers, and mothers and fathers may play unique roles during the development of child symptoms. Further research is needed on the role of genetic transmission associated with anxiety symptoms in biologically related families. In the meantime, researchers and clinicians should strive to include fathers in assessments and consider the effects of child symptoms on caregivers."
73,A,"BackgroundChildren in the UK go through rigorous teacher assessments and standardized exams throughout compulsory (elementary and secondary) education, culminating with the GCSE exams (General Certificate of Secondary Education) at the age of 16 and A-level exams (Advanced Certificate of Secondary Education) at the age of 18. These exams are a major tipping point directing young individuals towards different lifelong trajectories. However, little is known about the associations between teacher assessments and exam performance or how well these two measurement approaches predict educational outcomes at the end of compulsory education and beyond. MethodsThe current investigation used the UK-representative Twins Early Development Study (TEDS) sample of over 5,000 twin pairs studied longitudinally from childhood to young adulthood (age 7-18). We used teacher assessment and exam performance across development to investigate, using genetically sensitive designs, the associations between teacher assessment and standardized exam scores, as well as teacher assessments' prediction of exam scores at ages 16 and 18, and university enrolment. ResultsTeacher assessments of achievement are as reliable, stable and heritable (~60%) as test scores at every stage of the educational experience. Teacher and test scores correlate strongly phenotypically (r ~ .70) and genetically (genetic correlation ~.80) both contemporaneously and over time. Earlier exam performance accounts for additional variance in standardized exam results (~10%) at age 16, when controlling for teacher assessments. However, exam performance explains less additional variance in later academic success, ~5% for exam grades at 18, and ~3% for university entry, when controlling for teacher assessments. Teacher assessments also predict additional variance in later exam performance and university enrolment, when controlling for previous exam scores. ConclusionsTeachers can reliably and validly monitor students' progress, abilities and inclinations. High-stakes exams may shift educational experience away from learning towards exam performance. For these reasons, we suggest that teacher assessments could replace some, or all, high-stakes exams."
74,A,"Longitudinal investigations of relatively large typical-risk (e.g., Booth-LaForce & Roisman, 2014) and higher-risk samples (e.g., Raby et al., 2017; Roisman et al., 2017) have produced evidence consistent with the claim that attachment states of mind in adolescence and young adulthood, as measured by the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI), are associated with the quality of caregiving experienced during childhood. None of these studies, however, has examined whether such associations are consistent across sex and/or race, as would be expected in light of the sensitivity hypothesis of attachment theory. We examine whether sex or race moderates previously reported links between caregiving and AAI states of mind in two longitudinal studies (pooled N = 1,058) in which caregiving was measured either within (i.e., observed [in]sensitive care) or outside (i.e., childhood maltreatment) of the normative range of caregiving experiences. Hierarchical moderated regression analyses in both longitudinal cohorts provided evidence that maternal insensitivity and experiences of maltreatment were prospectively associated with dismissing and preoccupied states of mind in adolescence, as hypothesized. Moreover, these associations were generally comparable in magnitude for African American and White/non-Hispanic participants and were not conditional on participants' biological sex. Both maternal insensitivity and the experience of maltreatment increased risk for insecure attachment states of mind in adolescence. Moreover, our analyses provided little evidence that either participant race or participant sex assigned at birth moderated these nontrivial associations between measures of the quality of experienced caregiving and insecure attachment states of mind in adolescence. These findings provide support for the sensitivity hypothesis of attachment theory and inform the cultural universality hypothesis of attachment processes."
75,A,"Previous research has suggested that children exposed to more early-life stress show worse mental health outcomes and impaired cognitive performance in later life, but the mechanisms subserving these relationships remain poorly understood. Method Using miniaturised microphones and physiological arousal monitors (electrocardiography, heart rate variability and actigraphy), we examined for the first time infants' autonomic reactions to environmental stressors (noise) in the home environment, in a sample of 82 12-month-old infants from mixed demographic backgrounds. The same infants also attended a laboratory testing battery where attention- and emotion-eliciting stimuli were presented. We examined how children's environmental noise exposure levels at home related to their autonomic reactivity and to their behavioural performance in the laboratory. Individual differences in total noise exposure were independent of other socioeconomic and parenting variables. Children exposed to higher and more rapidly fluctuating environmental noise showed more unstable autonomic arousal patterns overall in home settings. In the laboratory testing battery, this group showed more labile and short-lived autonomic changes in response to novel attention-eliciting stimuli, along with reduced visual sustained attention. They also showed increased arousal lability in response to an emotional stressor. Our results offer new insights into the mechanisms by which environmental noise exposure may confer increased risk of adverse mental health and impaired cognitive performance during later life."
76,A,"An estimated 63.4 million Indian children under 5 years are at risk of poor development. Home visits that use a structured curriculum to help caregivers enhance the quality of the home stimulation environment improve developmental outcomes. However, achieving effectiveness in poor urban contexts through scalable models remains challenging. Using a cluster randomised controlled trial, we evaluated a psychosocial stimulation intervention, comprising weekly home visits for 18 months, in urban slums of Cuttack, Odisha, India. The intervention is complementary to existing early childhood services in India and was run and managed through a local branch of a national NGO. The study ran from August 2013 to July 2015. We enrolled 421 children aged 10-20 months from 54 slums. Slums were randomised to intervention or control. Primary outcomes were children's cognitive, receptive language, expressive language and fine motor development assessed using the Bayley-III. Prespecified intent-to-treat analysis investigated impacts and heterogeneity by gender. Trial registrations: ISRCTN89476603, AEARCTR-0000169. Endline data for 378 (89.8%) children were analysed. Attrition was balanced between groups. We found improvements of 0.349 of a standard deviation (SD; p = .005, stepdown p = .017) to cognition while impacts on receptive language, expressive language and fine motor development were, respectively, 0.224 SD (p = .099, stepdown p = .184), 0.192 SD (p = .085, stepdown p = .184) and 0.111 (p = .385, stepdown p = .385). A child development factor improved by 0.301 SD (p = .032). Benefits were larger for boys. The quality of the home stimulation environment also improved. This study shows that a potentially scalable home-visiting intervention is effective in poor urban areas."
77,A,"Both 'early-onset persistent' and 'adolescent-onset' conduct problems (CPs) are associated with alcohol-related problems in emerging adulthood. The escalation of early CPs into criminal behaviour and heavy alcohol consumption prior to emerging adulthood are both likely to be important pathways. Data were analysed from 3,038 young people in a UK birth cohort, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. The exposure was developmental trajectories of CPs ('low', 'childhood-limited', 'adolescent-onset' and 'early-onset persistent') between ages 4 and 13 years. The mediator was latent classes representing heavy alcohol consumption and/ or criminal behaviour at age 15 years. For the outcome, a quadratic latent growth curve was estimated to capture nonlinear change in alcohol-related problems between ages 18 and 23 years. Those with 'early-onset persistent' [b(95% CI) = 1.16 (0.17, 2.14)] and 'adolescent-onset' CPs [b(95% CI) = 1.31 (0.17, 2.45)] had higher levels of alcohol-related problems at age 18 years compared to those with 'low' CPs', but there was little evidence of an association with alcohol-related problems after age 19 years. There was evidence for an indirect effect of 'early-onset persistent' CPs [b(95% CI) = 1.12 (0.52, 1.72)] on alcohol-related problems at age 18 years via the latent classes of alcohol and criminal behaviour in adolescence. This was not found for 'adolescent-onset' CPs [b(95% CI) = 0.35 (-0.36, 1.07)]. Strong associations exist between early CPs, adolescent alcohol consumption and criminal behaviour and alcohol-related problems at age 18 years. Associations between early CPs and alcohol-related problems weakened considerably across emerging adulthood."
78,A,"Research to date has largely conceptualized irritability in terms of intraindividual differences. However, the role of interpersonal dyadic processes has received little consideration. Nevertheless, difficulties in how parent-child dyads synchronize during interactions may be an important correlate of irritably in early childhood. Innovations in developmentally sensitive neuroimaging methods now enable the use of measures of neural synchrony to quantify synchronous responses in parent-child dyads and can help clarify the neural underpinnings of these difficulties. We introduce the Disruptive Behavior Diagnostic Observation Schedule: Biological Synchrony (DB-DOS:BioSync) as a paradigm for exploring parent-child neural synchrony as a potential biological mechanism for interpersonal difficulties in preschool psychopathology. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) 4- to 5-year-olds (N = 116) and their mothers completed the DB-DOS:BioSync while assessing neural synchrony during mild frustration and recovery. Child irritability was measured using a latent irritability factor that was calculated from four developmentally sensitive indicators. Both the mild frustration and the recovery contexts resulted in neural synchrony. However, less neural synchrony during the recovery context only was associated with more child irritability. Our results suggest that recovering after a frustrating period might be particularly challenging for children high in irritability and offer support for the use of the DB-DOS:BioSync task to elucidate interpersonal neural mechanisms of developmental psychopathology."
79,A,"This study examined the 6-month follow-up outcomes of the Transdiagnostic Sleep and Circadian Intervention (TranS-C), compared to Psychoeducation about sleep and health (PE). Adolescents (mean [SD] = 14.77 [1.84] years) with eveningness chronotype and """"at-risk"""" in at least one of five health domains were randomized to receive TranS-C (n = 89) or PE (n = 87) at a university-based clinic. Primary outcomes were average weeknight total sleep time and bedtime calculated from sleep diary, a questionnaire measure of circadian preference, and composite risks in five health domains. Secondary outcomes were selected sleep diary indices, sleepiness, and self- and parent-reported sleep, parent-reported risks in five health domains. Relative to PE, TranS-C showed treatment effects through 6-month follow-up on only one primary outcome; namely eveningness circadian preference. TranS-C also showed treatment effects on two sleep and circadian secondary outcomes, including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and sleep-diary measured weeknight-weekend discrepancy in wakeup time. TranS-C did not show treatment effects on self-report or parent-report composite risks in five health domains. PE showed benefit, relative to TranS-C, from posttreatment to 6-month follow-up for reducing parent-reported behavioral health risk (secondary outcome). In at-risk adolescents, the evidence supports the TranS-C treatment effects over six months on improving sleep and circadian functioning on selected outcomes but not on reducing risk in five health domains."
80,A,"This study evaluated the acceptability and effectiveness of a relationship-focussed mobile phone application (WeClick) for improving depressive symptoms and other mental health outcomes in adolescents. A randomised controlled trial involving 193 youth (M age: 14.82, SD: 0.94, 86.5% female) from Australia was conducted. Youth were recruited via the Internet and randomly allocated to the intervention or a 4-week wait list control condition, stratified for age and gender. The primary outcome was change in depressive symptom scores measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire for Adolescents (PHQ-A) at baseline, 4-week post-test and 12-week follow-up. Secondary outcomes included anxiety, psychological distress, wellbeing, help-seeking intentions for mental health, social self-efficacy and social support. Participants in the intervention condition received access to the intervention for four weeks. Thematic analysis was utilised to identify and examine acceptability. The change in PHQ-A scores from baseline to 4-week post-test did not differ significantly (d = 0.26,p = .138) between the intervention (Mchange = -2.9,SD = 5.3) and wait list control conditions (Mchange = -1.7,SD = 4.3). However, significant between-group improvements were observed in wellbeing (d = 0.37,p = .023), help-seeking intentions (d = 0.36,p = .016) and professional help-seeking intentions for mental health problems (d = 0.36,p = .008). Increases in help-seeking intentions were sustained at follow-up in the intervention condition. No differential effects were found for generalised anxiety, separation anxiety, social self-efficacy or for any social support outcomes. Over 90% of participants indicated the app was enjoyable, interesting and easy to use. The app provided 'advice and direction' (n = 42; 46.15%), an 'opportunity for self-reflection' (n = 33; 36.3%) and 'normalised experiences' (n = 21; 23.1%). The WeClick app was found to be effective for improving wellbeing and help-seeking intentions for mental health in adolescents. A larger, adequately powered trial is now required to establish differential effects on depressive symptoms. This trial was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR): ACTRN12618001982202."
81,A,"Difficulties with facial expression processing may be associated with the characteristic social impairments in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Emotional face processing in ASD has been investigated in an abundance of behavioral and EEG studies, yielding, however, mixed and inconsistent results. We combined fast periodic visual stimulation (FPVS) with EEG to assess the neural sensitivity to implicitly detect briefly presented facial expressions among a stream of neutral faces, in 23 boys with ASD and 23 matched typically developing (TD) boys. Neutral faces with different identities were presented at 6 Hz, periodically interleaved with an expressive face (angry, fearful, happy, sad in separate sequences) every fifth image (i.e., 1.2 Hz oddball frequency). These distinguishable frequency tags for neutral and expressive stimuli allowed direct and objective quantification of the expression-categorization responses, needing only four sequences of 60 s of recording per condition. Both groups show equal neural synchronization to the general face stimulation and similar neural responses to happy and sad faces. However, the ASD group displays significantly reduced responses to angry and fearful faces, compared to TD boys. At the individual subject level, these neural responses allow to predict membership of the ASD group with an accuracy of 87%. Whereas TD participants show a significantly lower sensitivity to sad faces than to the other expressions, ASD participants show an equally low sensitivity to all the expressions. Our results indicate an emotion-specific processing deficit, instead of a general emotion-processing problem: Boys with ASD are less sensitive than TD boys to rapidly and implicitly detect angry and fearful faces. The implicit, fast, and straightforward nature of FPVS-EEG opens new perspectives for clinical diagnosis."
82,A,"Top-down volitional command of eye movements may serve as a candidate endophenotype of ADHD, an important function underlying goal-directed action in everyday life. In this twin study, we examined the relation between performance on a response inhibition eye-tracking paradigm and parent-rated ADHD traits in a population-based twin sample. We hypothesized that altered eye movement control is associated with the severity of ADHD traits and that this association is attributable to genetic factors. A total of 640 twins (320 pairs, 50% monozygotic) aged 9-14 years) from the Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden (CATSS) participated. Twins performed the antisaccade task indexing inhibitory alterations as either direction errors (following exogenous cues rather than instructions) or premature anticipatory eye movements (failure to wait for cues). We calculated the associations of eye movement control and ADHD traits using linear regression mixed-effects models and genetic and environmental influences with multivariate twin models. Premature anticipatory eye movements were positively associated with inattentive traits (beta = .17; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.31), while controlling for hyperactive behaviors and other covariates. Both premature anticipatory eye movements and inattention were heritable (h(2) = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.22, 0.56; h(2) = 0.55; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.65; respectively), and their genetic correlation was small but statistically significant (r = .19, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.36). However, the genetic correlation did not remain significant after adjusting for covariates (age, sex, hyperactivity traits, IQ). No link was found between direction errors and ADHD traits. This study indicates that there is a specific, genetically influenced, relation between top-down eye movement control and the inattentive traits typical of ADHD."
83,A,"Sleep problems are common in adolescence, and frequently comorbid with both anxiety and depression. Research studies have suggested a bidirectional relationship between sleep and psychopathology, which includes evidence that sleep interventions can alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, little is known about the nature of sleep problems amongst adolescents with anxiety and depression, and whether specific sleeping difficulties are involved in the longitudinal relationship between sleep, anxiety and depression. Method The sample was derived from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a population-based, prospective, birth cohort study of children born in 1991-1992. Data were explored from a subset of participants who took part in a clinical assessment at age 15, on self-report sleep patterns and quality, and diagnostic outcomes of anxiety and depression (N = 5,033). Subsequent diagnostic and symptom severity data on anxiety and depression at ages 17, 21 and 24 were also examined. Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses were conducted to explore the relationship between sleep problems, anxiety and depression. revealed that adolescents aged 15 with depression experience difficulties with both sleep patterns and sleep quality, whereas adolescents with anxiety only reported problems with sleep quality. A range of sleep variables at age 15 predicted the severity of anxiety and depression symptoms and the diagnoses of anxiety and depressive disorders at age 17, 21 and 24 years. The results provide further insight into the nature of sleep problems amongst adolescents with anxiety and depression, and the prospective relationship between sleep disturbance and future psychopathology. These data suggest that targeting sleep difficulties during adolescence may have long-term mental health benefits."
84,A,"Although factors such as adverse family background have been widely examined, little is known about the prevalence or potential impact of developmental language disorder (DLD) on risk of recidivism in young people with history of criminal justice system contact. A total of 145 young offenders participated. An adversity score was constructed based on information found in youth justice service records. Data collected included standardised measures of expressive and receptive language, nonverbal IQ and the inventory of callous-unemotional traits. Survival analysis was performed to examine differences in reoffending risk between young offenders with and without DLD. The cumulative incidence of reoffending within a year of the young person's court order was markedly raised in the DLD group (62%; 95% CI 52, 72) versus the non-DLD group (25%; 95% CI 16, 39). Furthermore, in the final multivariable survival analysis the independent elevation in risk linked with DLD was not greatly attenuated with adjustment for nonverbal IQ, adversity score, age at first offence, number of previous offences and deprivation score. DLD was the most significant predictor with an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.61 (95% CI 1.80, 3.78). Young offenders with DLD are more than twice as likely to reoffend than their unaffected offending peers. DLD is a powerful predictor of recidivism above and beyond other known risk factors."
85,A,"and objectives Preterm birth is associated with atypical social cognition in infancy, and cognitive impairment and social difficulties in childhood. Little is known about the stability of social cognition through childhood, and its relationship with neurodevelopment. We used eye-tracking in preterm and term-born infants to investigate social attentional preference in infancy and at 5 years, its relationship with neurodevelopment and the influence of socioeconomic deprivation. A cohort of 81 preterm and 66 term infants with mean (range) gestational age at birth 28(+5)(23(+2)-33(+0)) and 40(+0)(37(+0)-42(+1)) respectively, completed eye-tracking at 7-9 months, with a subset re-assessed at 5 years. Three free-viewing social tasks of increasing stimulus complexity were presented, and a social preference score was derived from looking time to socially informative areas. Socioeconomic data and the Mullen Scales of Early Learning at 5 years were collected. Preterm children had lower social preference scores at 7-9 months compared with term-born controls. Term-born children's scores were stable between time points, whereas preterm children showed a significant increase, reaching equivalent scores by 5 years. Low gestational age and socioeconomic deprivation were associated with reduced social preference scores at 7-9 months. At 5 years, preterm infants had lower Early Learning Composite scores than controls, but this was not associated with social attentional preference in infancy or at 5 years. Preterm children have reduced social attentional preference at 7-9 months compared with term-born controls, but catch up by 5 years. Infant social cognition is influenced by socioeconomic deprivation and gestational age. Social cognition and neurodevelopment have different trajectories following preterm birth."
86,A,"This study investigated mother-infant interactions, including maternal maintaining of infant attentional focus and sensitivity, with infants with congenital severe and profound visual impairment (VI) and the association with developmental trajectories from one to three years. Method Fifty-five infants and mothers were video-recorded playing together with a standard set of toys at Time 1 (T1) mean age 12.95 months (8.13-17.05 months).Maintainwas categorized as the mother following and maintaining the child's focus, andSensitivity, the mother's responsiveness and contingency to infant behaviour. Vision level was measured using the Near Detection Scale. Cognition and language were measured at T1, 12 months later (T2) and 24 months later (T3) using the Reynell-Zinkin Scales. Cross-sectional analyses showed that mothers of infants with severe VI (basic form vision) produced higher rates of Maintain compared to those with children with profound VI (light perception at best). Linear mixed-effects models examining developmental progression from T1 to T3 (controlling for vision level) showed an average increase of 5 DQ points (CI 95%: 1.03-9.08) in verbal comprehension for higher Sensitivity. No significant findings were found for Maintain. The findings suggest that mother-infant interactions (maternal Maintain) are associated with level of vision at infancy, but only maternal Sensitivity has a long-term positive association with advances in verbal comprehension from infancy to about three years. They highlight the need for incorporating strategies related to parent-infant interactions, including increased sensitivity, into early intervention for children with visual impairment."
87,C,"Earth-mass exoplanets are difficult to detect. The Dispersed Matter Planet Project (DMPP) identifies stars that are likely to host the most detectable low-mass exoplanets. The star DMPP-3 (HD 42936) shows signs of circumstellar absorption, indicative of mass loss from ablating planets. Here, we report the radial velocity discovery of a highly eccentric 507 d binary companion and a hot super-Earth-mass planet in a 6.67 d orbit around the primary star. DMPP-3A is a solar-type star while DMPP-3B is just massive enough to fuse hydrogen. The binary, with semi-major axis 1.22 +/- 0.02 au, is considerably tighter than others known to host planets orbiting only one of the component stars. The configuration of the DMPP-3 planetary system is rare and indicates dynamical interactions, though the evolutionary history is not entirely clear. DMPP-3A b is possibly the residual core of a giant planet precursor, consistent with the inferred circumstellar gas shroud. The third target of the Dispersed Matter Planet Project, DMPP-3, is an unusual binary system containing a solar-type star ablating a super-Earth-mass planet, along with a very low mass secondary."
88,C,"Recent studies(1,2) have revealed that all large (over 1,000 km in diameter) trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) form satellite systems. Although the largest Plutonian satellite, Charon, is thought to be an intact fragment of an impactor directly formed via a giant impact(3), whether giant impacts can explain the variations in secondary-to-primary mass ratios (the ratio between the body and its main satellite) and spin/orbital periods among all large TNOs remains to be determined. Here we find that hydrodynamic simulations of giant impacts can reproduce the secondary-to-primary mass ratio of the satellite systems of large TNOs when the impact velocity is approximately the same as the escape velocity. We also reveal that the satellite systems' current distribution of spin/orbital periods and small eccentricity can be most easily explained when their spins and orbits tidally evolve, initially as fluid-like bodies and finally as rigid bodies. The preferred duration of fluidlike behaviour is approximately 10(4) -10(6) yr, and it depends on the secondary-to-primary mass ratio and the initial orbital elements. These results suggest that all satellites of large TNOs were formed via giant impacts before the outward migration of Neptune(4) and that they were fully or partially molten during the giant impact era."
89,B,"The recession of 2008 precipitated a political crisis that motivated an unprecedented international project to curb corporate tax dodging. This Article argues, contrary to dominant scholarly views, that this effort transformed international tax-changing its participants, agenda, institutions, norms, and even its legal forms. Perhaps most important, efforts to close corporate tax loopholes widened a rift over revenues that threatens a hundred-year-old tax treaty framework. This Article identifies and critically evaluates these changes."
90,C,"A critical step toward the emergence of planets in a protoplanetary disk is the accretion of planetesimals, bodies 1-1,000 km in size, from smaller disk constituents. This process is poorly understood, partly because we lack good observational constraints on the complex physical processes that contribute to planetesimal formation(1). In the outer Solar System, the best place to look for clues is the Kuiper belt, where icy planetesimals survive to this day. Here we report evidence that Kuiper belt planetesimals formed by the streaming instability, a process in which aerodynamically concentrated clumps of pebbles gravitationally collapse into 100-kilometre-class bodies'. Gravitational collapse has previously been suggested to explain the ubiquity of equal-sized binaries in the Kuiper belt(3-5). We analyse new hydrodynamical simulations of the streaming instability to determine the model expectations for the spatial orientation of binary orbits. The predicted broad inclination distribution with approximately 80% of prograde binary orbits matches the observations of trans-Neptunian binaries(6). The formation models that imply predominantly retrograde binary orbits (for example, ref.(7)) can be ruled out. Given its applicability over a wide range of protoplanetary disk conditions(8), it is expected that the streaming instability also seeded planetesimal formation elsewhere in the Solar System, and beyond."
91,C,"With no analogues in the Solar System, the discovery of thousands of exoplanets with masses and radii intermediate between Earth and Neptune was one of the big surprises of exoplanet science. These super-Earths and sub-Neptunes probably represent the most common outcome of planet formation(1,2). Mass and radius measurements indicate a diversity in bulk composition much wider than for gas giants(3); however, direct spectroscopic detections of molecular absorption and constraints on the gas mixing ratios have largely remained limited to planets more massive than Neptune(4-6). Here we analyse a combined Hubble/Spitzer Space Telescope dataset of 12 transits and 20 eclipses of the sub-Neptune exoplanet GJ 3470 b, whose mass of 12.6M(circle plus) places it near the halfway point between previously studied Neptune-like exoplanets (22-23M(circle plus))(5-7) and exoplanets known to have rocky densities (7M(circle plus))(8). Obtained over many years, our dataset provides a robust detection of water absorption (>5 sigma) and a thermal emission detection from the lowest irradiated planet to date. We reveal a low-metallicity, hydrogen-dominated atmosphere similar to that of a gas giant, but strongly depleted in methane gas. The low metallicity (O/H = 0.2-18.0) sets important constraints on the potential planet formation processes at low masses as well as the subsequent accretion of solids. The low methane abundance indicates that methane is destroyed much more efficiently than previously predicted, suggesting that the CH4/CO transition curve has to be revisited for close-in planets. Finally, we also find a sharp drop in the cloud opacity at 2-3 mu m, characteristic of Mie scattering, which enables narrow constraints on the cloud particle size and makes GJ 3470 b a key target for mid-infrared characterization with the James Webb Space Telescope."
92,C,"Theory suggests that there are two primary modes of accretion through which dark-matter halos acquire the gas to form and fuel galaxies: hot- and cold-flow accretion. In cold-flow accretion, gas streams along cosmic web filaments to the centre of the halo, allowing for the efficient delivery of star-forming fuel. Recently, two quasar-illuminated H1 Lyman alpha (Ly alpha)-emitting objects were reported to have properties of cold, rotating structures(1,2). However, the spatial and spectral resolution available was insufficient to constrain the radial flows associated with connecting filaments. With the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI)(3), we now have eight times the spatial resolution, permitting the detection of these inspirailing flows. To detect these inflows, we introduce a suite of models that incorporate zonal radial flows, demonstrate their performance on a numerical simulation that exhibits cold-flow accretion, and show that they are an excellent match to KCWI velocity maps of two Ly alpha emitters observed around high-redshift quasars. These multi-filament inflow models kinematically isolate zones of radial inflow that correspond to extended filamentary emission. The derived gas flux and inflow path is sufficient to fuel the inferred central galaxy star-formation rate and angular momentum. Thus, our kinematic emission maps provide strong evidence that the inflow of gas from the cosmic web is building galaxies at the peak of star formation."
93,C,"Transport properties, such as viscosity and thermal conduction, of the hot intergalactic plasma in clusters of galaxies are largely unknown. Whereas for laboratory plasmas these characteristics are derived from the gas density and temperature(1), such recipes can be fundamentally different for the intergalactic plasma(2) owing to a low rate of particle collisions and a weak magnetic field(3). In numerical simulations, these unknowns can often be avoided by modelling these plasmas as hydrodynamic fluids(4-6), even though local, non-hydrodynamic features observed in clusters contradict this assumptions(7-)(9). Using deep Chandra observations of the Coma Cluster(10,11), we probe gas fluctuations in intergalactic medium down to spatial scales where the transport processes should prominently manifest themselves-provided that hydrodynamic models(12) with pure Coulomb collision rates are indeed adequate. We do not find evidence of such transport processes, implying that the effective isotropic viscosity is orders of magnitude smaller than naively expected. This indicates either an enhanced collision rate in the plasma due to particle scattering off microfluctuations caused by plasma instabilities(2,13,24) or that the transport processes are anisotropic with respect to the local magnetic field(15). This also means that numerical models with high Reynolds number appear more consistent with observations. Our results demonstrate that observations of turbulence in clusters(16,17) are giving rise to a branch of astrophysics that can sharpen theoretical views on galactic plasmas."
94,C,"Clusters of galaxies are the largest known gravitationally bound structures in the Universe. When clusters collide, they create merger shocks on cosmological scales, which transform most of the kinetic energy carried by the cluster gaseous halos into heat(1-3). Observations of merger shocks provide key information on the merger dynamics, and enable insights into the formation and thermal history of the large-scale structures. Nearly all of the merger shocks are found in systems where the clusters have already collided(4-12); knowledge of shocks in the premerger phase is a crucial missing ingredient(13)(,)(14). Here, we report on the discovery of a unique shock in a cluster pair 1E2216.00401 and 1E 2215.7-0404. The two clusters are observed at an early phase of major merger. Contrary to all the known merger shocks observed ubiquitously on merger axes, the new shock propagates outward along the equatorial plane of the merger. This discovery uncovers an important epoch in the formation of massive clusters, when the rapid approach of the cluster pair leads to strong compression of gas along the merger axis. Current theoretical models(15)(,)(16) predict that the bulk of the shock energy might be dissipated outside the clusters, and eventually turn into heat of the pristine gas in the circum-cluster space."
95,C,"Bars are elongated structures that extend from the centre of galaxies, and about one-third of disk galaxies are known to possess bars(1-3). These bars are thought to form either through a physical process inherent in galaxies(4-6) , or through an external process such as galaxy-galaxy interactions(7-9).( )However, there are other plausible mechanisms of bar formation that still need to be observationally tested. Here we present the observational evidence that bars can form via cluster-cluster interaction(10). We examined 105 galaxy clusters at redshift 0.015 < z < 0.060 that are selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data, and identified 16 interacting clusters. We find that the barred disk-dominated galaxy fraction is about 1.5 times higher in interacting clusters than in clusters with no clear signs of ongoing interaction (42% versus 27%). Our result indicates that bars can form through a large-scale violent phenomenon, and cluster-cluster interaction should be considered an important mechanism of bar formation."
96,C,"The top-shaped morphology characteristic of asteroid (101955) Bennu, often found among fast-spinning asteroids and binary asteroid primaries, may have contributed substantially to binary asteroid formation. Yet a detailed geophysical analysis of this morphology for a fast-spinning asteroid has not been possible prior to the Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) mission. Combining the measured Bennu mass and shape obtained during the Preliminary Survey phase of the OSIRIS-REx mission, we find a notable transition in Bennu's surface slopes within its rotational Roche lobe, defined as the region where material is energetically trapped to the surface. As the intersection of the rotational Roche lobe with Bennu's surface has been most recently migrating towards its equator (given Bennu's increasing spin rate), we infer that Bennu's surface slopes have been changing across its surface within the last million years. We also find evidence for substantial density heterogeneity within this body, suggesting that its interior is a mixture of voids and boulders. The presence of such heterogeneity and Bennu's top shape are consistent with spin-induced failure at some point in its past, although the manner of its failure cannot yet be determined. Future measurements by the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft will provide insight into and may resolve questions regarding the formation and evolution of Bennu's top-shape morphology and its link to the formation of binary asteroids."
97,C,"The Solar System is located within a low-density cavity known as the Local Bubble(1-3), which appears to be filled with an X-ray-emitting gas at a temperature of 10(6) K (ref.(4)). Such conditions are too harsh for typical interstellar atoms and molecules to survive(2,3). The diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs), the carriers of which remain largely unidentified(5), often appear as absorption features in stellar spectra(6-8) and can be used to trace interstellar gas. Here we report the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the Local Bubble using two different DIB tracers (lambda 5,780 and lambda 5,797), which reveals that DIB carriers are present within the Bubble(9-11). The 3D map shows low values of lambda 5,797/lambda 5,780 inside the Bubble compared with the outside. This finding proves that the carrier of the lambda 5,780 DIB can withstand X-ray photodissociation and sputtering by fast ions, whereas the carrier of the lambda 5,797 DIB succumbs. This implies that DIB carriers are more stable than hitherto thought, and that the carrier of the lambda 5,780 DIB must be larger than that of the lambda 5,797 DIB12. Alternatively, small-scale denser (and cooler) structures that shield some of the DIB carriers must be prevalent within the Bubble, suggesting that such structures may be an intrinsic feature of supernova-driven bubbles."
98,C,"Fast radio bursts are extragalactic, sub-millisecond radio impulses of unknown origin(1,2). Their dispersion measures, which quantify the observed frequency-dependent dispersive delays in terms of free-electron column densities, greatly exceed predictions from models(3) of the Milky Way interstellar medium. The excess dispersions are probably accrued as fast radio bursts propagate through their host galaxies, gaseous galactic halos and the intergalactic medium(4,)(5). Despite extensive follow-up observations of the published sample of 72 burst sources(6), only two have been observed to repeat(7,8), and it is unknown whether the remainder are truly one-off events. Here I show that the volumetric occurrence rate of the fast radio bursts that have not been observed to repeat thus far probably exceeds the rates of candidate cataclysmic progenitor events, and also probably exceeds the birth rates of candidate compact-object sources. This analysis is based on the high detection rate of bursts with low dispersion measures by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME)(9). Within the existing suite of astrophysical scenarios for fast radio burst progenitors, I conclude that most observed cases must originate from sources that emit several bursts over their lifetimes."
99,C,"Knowledge of the ages of the stars formed over a galaxy's lifetime is fundamental to an understanding of its formation and evolution. However, stellar ages are difficult to obtain since they cannot be measured from observations, but require comparison with stellar models(1). Alternatively, age distributions can be derived by applying the robust technique of colour-magnitude diagram fitting(2), which until now has been used primarily to study nearby galaxies. Accurate distances to individual Milky Way stars now provided by the Gaia spacecraft mission(3) have allowed us to derive ages from a thick-disk colour-magnitude diagram and from the two-sequenced colour-magnitude diagram of the kinematically hot local halo(4), whose blue sequence has been linked to a major accretion event, GalaEnceladus(5,6). Because accurate stellar ages were lacking, the time of the merger and its role in our Galaxy's early evolution remained unclear. Here we show that the stars in both halo sequences share identical age distributions, and are older than most of the thick-disk stars. The sharp halo age distribution cutoff at ten billion years ago can be identified with the time of accretion of Gaia-Enceladus to the Milky Way. Together with state-of-the-art cosmological simulations of galaxy formation(7), these robust ages allow us to order the early sequence of events that shaped our Galaxy. We identify the red-sequence stars as the first stars formed within the Milky Way progenitor, and their kinematics indicate that these stars constitute the long-sought in situ halo of the Milky Way."
100,B,"By a September 17, 2019 Order (Order), the German Federal Constitutional Court (FCC or Court) rejected challenges to Germany's military involvement in anti-Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) operations in Syria. This outcome was expected and was as such insignificant. What is significant is the FCC's reasoning. The Court used the Order to clarify the constitutional roles of parliament and the executive in German foreign affairs. And it included an intriguing pronouncement on the scope of Article 51 of the UN Charter, which adds a fresh perspective to the polarized debates about self-defense against nonstate actors."
101,C,"The Hubble constant (H-0) measures the current expansion rate of the Universe, and plays a fundamental role in cosmology. Tremendous effort has been dedicated over the past decades to measure H-0 (refs. (1-10)). Gravitational wave (GW) sources accompanied by electromagnetic (EM) counterparts offer an independent standard siren measurement of H-0 (refs. (11-)(13)), as demonstrated following the discovery of the neutron star merger, GW170817 (refs. (14-16)) This measurement does not assume a cosmological model and is independent of a cosmic distance ladder. The first joint analysis of the GW signal from GW170817 and its EM localization led to a measurement of H-0 = 74(-8)(+16) km s(-1) Mpc(-1) (median and symmetric 68% credible interval)(13). In this analysis, the degeneracy in the GW signal between the source distance and the observing angle dominated the H-0 measurement uncertainty. Recently, tight constraints on the observing angle using high angular resolution imaging of the radio counterpart of GW170817 have been obtained(17). Here, we report an improved measurement H-0 = 70.3(-5.0)(+5.3) km s(-1) Mpc(-1) by using these new radio observations, combined with the previous GW and EM data. We estimate that 15 more GW170817-like events, having radio images and light curve data, as compared with 50-100 GW events without such data(18)(,)(19), will potentially resolve the tension between the Planck and Cepheid-supernova measurements."
102,C,"Future astronomical surveys will gather information that will allow gravity to be tested on cosmological scales, where general relativity is currently poorly constrained. We present a set of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations that follow galaxy formation in f(R) modified gravity models and are dedicated to finding observational signatures to help distinguish general relativity from alternatives using this information. The simulations employ the IllustrisTNG model and a new modified gravity solver in AREPO, allowing the interplay of baryonic feedback and modified gravity to be studied in the same simulation, and the degeneracy between them in the matter power spectrum to be resolved. We find that the neutral hydrogen power spectrum is suppressed substantially in f(R) gravity, which allows this model to be constrained using upcoming data from the Square Kilometre Array. Disk galaxies can form in our f(R) gravity simulations, even in the partially screened regime, and their galaxy stellar properties are only mildly affected. We conclude that modified gravity allows the formation of realistic galaxies and leaves observable signatures on large scales."
103,C,"C-type asteroids are among the most pristine objects in the Solar System, but little is known about their interior structure and surface properties. Telescopic thermal infrared observations have so far been interpreted in terms of a regolith-covered surface with low thermal conductivity and particle sizes in the centimetre range. This includes observations of C-type asteroid (162173) Ryugu(1-3). However, on arrival of the Hayabusa2 spacecraft at Ryugu, a regolith cover of sand- to pebble-sized particles was found to be absent(4,5) (R.J. et al., manuscript in preparation). Rather, the surface is largely covered by cobbles and boulders, seemingly incompatible with the remote-sensing infrared observations. Here we report on in situ thermal infrared observations of a boulder on the C-type asteroid Ryugu. We found that the boulder's thermal inertia was much lower than anticipated based on laboratory measurements of meteorites, and that a surface covered by such low-conductivity boulders would be consistent with remote-sensing observations. Our results furthermore indicate high boulder porosities as well as a low tensile strength in the few hundred kilopascal range. The predicted low tensile strength confirms the suspected observational bias(6) in our meteorite collections, as such asteroidal material would be too frail to survive atmospheric entry(7)."
104,C,"Spectacular advances in heterodyne astronomy(1,2) have been largely due to breakthroughs in detector technology(3). To exploit the full capacity of future terahertz (similar to 300 GHz-5 THz) telescope space missions(4), new concepts of terahertz coherent receivers are needed, providing larger bandwidths and imaging capabilities with multipixel focal plane heterodyne arrays(5). Here we show that graphene uniformly doped to the Dirac point, with material resistance dominated by quantum localization and thermal relaxation governed by electron diffusion, enables highly sensitive and wideband coherent detection of signals from 90 to 700 GHz and, prospectively, across the entire terahertz range. We measure on proof-of-concept graphene bolometric mixers an electron diffusion-limited gain bandwidth of 8 GHz (corresponding to a Doppler shift of 480 km s(-1) at 5 THz) and intrinsic mixer noise temperature of 475 K (which would be equivalent to similar to 2 hf/k(B) at f = 5 THz, where h is Planck's constant, f is the frequency and k(B) is the Boltzmann constant), limited by the residual thermal background in our setup. An optimized device will result in a mixer noise temperature as low as 36 K, with the gain bandwidth exceeding 20 GHz, and a local oscillator power of <100 pW. In conjunction with the emerging quantum-limited amplifiers at the intermediate frequency(6,7), our approach promises quantum-limited sensing in the terahertz domain, potentially surpassing superconducting technologies, particularly for large heterodyne arrays."
105,E,"The Leiden Rankings can be used for grouping research universities by considering universities which are not statistically significantly different as homogeneous sets. The groups and intergroup relations can be analyzed and visualized using tools from network analysis. Using the so-called """"excellence indicator"""" PPtop-10%-the proportion of the top-10% most-highly-cited papers assigned to a university-we pursue a classification using (a) overlapping stability intervals, (b) statistical-significance tests, and (c) effect sizes of differences among 902 universities in 54 countries; we focus on the UK, Germany, Brazil, and the USA as national examples. Although the groupings remain largely the same using different statistical significance levels or overlapping stability intervals, these classifications are uncorrelated with those based on effect sizes. Effect sizes for the differences between universities are small (w < .2). The more detailed analysis of universities at the country level suggests that distinctions beyond three or perhaps four groups of universities (high, middle, low) may not be meaningful. Given similar institutional incentives, isomorphism within each eco-system of universities should not be underestimated. Our results suggest that networks based on overlapping stability intervals can provide a first impression of the relevant groupings among universities. However, the clusters are not well-defined divisions between groups of universities."
106,E,"This research article puts forward a method to identify the national heritage of authors based on the morphology of their surnames. Most studies in the field use variants of dictionary-based surname methods to identify ethnic communities, an approach that suffers from methodological limitations. Using the public file of ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID) identifiers in 2015, we developed a surname-based identification method and applied it to infer Russian heritage from suffix-based morphological regularities. The method was developed conceptually and tested in an undersampled control set. Identification based on surname morphology was then complemented by using first-name data to eliminate false-positive results. The method achieved 98% precision and 94% recall rates-superior to most other methods that use name data. The procedure can be adapted to identify the heritage of a variety of national groups with morphologically regular naming traditions. We elaborate on how the method can be employed to overcome long-standing limitations of using name data in bibliometric datasets. This identification method can contribute to advancing research in scientific mobility and migration, patenting by certain groups, publishing and collaboration, transnational and scientific diaspora links, and the effects of diversity on the innovative performance of organizations, regions, and countries."
107,E,"In this study we investigate if articles suffering delayed recognition can at the same time be under-cited influential articles. Theoretically these two types of articles are independent, in the sense that suffering delayed recognition depends on the number and time distribution of received citations, while being an under-cited influential article depends only partially on the number of received (first generation) citations, and much more on second and third citation generations. Among 49 articles suffering delayed recognition we found 13 that are also under-cited influential. Based on a thorough investigation of these special cases we found that so-called authoritative citers play an important role in uniting the two different document types into a special citation chimera. Our investigation contributes to the classification of publications."
108,E,"This study investigates motivations for self-archiving research items on academic social networking sites (ASNSs). A model of these motivations was developed based on two existing motivation models: motivation for self-archiving in academia and motivations for information sharing in social media. The proposed model is composed of 18 factors drawn from personal, social, professional, and external contexts, including enjoyment, personal/professional gain, reputation, learning, self-efficacy, altruism, reciprocity, trust, community interest, social engagement, publicity, accessibility, self-archiving culture, influence of external actors, credibility, system stability, copyright concerns, additional time, and effort. Two hundred and twenty-six ResearchGate users participated in the survey. Accessibility was the most highly rated factor, followed by altruism, reciprocity, trust, self-efficacy, reputation, publicity, and others. Personal, social, and professional factors were also highly rated, while external factors were rated relatively low. Motivations were correlated with one another, demonstrating that RG motivations for self-archiving could increase or decrease based on several factors in combination with motivations from the personal, social, professional, and external contexts. We believe the findings from this study can increase our understanding of users' motivations in sharing their research and provide useful implications for the development and improvement of ASNS services, thereby attracting more active users."
109,E,"Advancements in computer-mediated exercise put forward the feasibility of telerehabilitation, but it remains a challenge to retain patients' engagement in exercises. Building on our previous study demonstrating enhanced engagement in citizen science through social information about others' contributions, we propose a novel framework for effective telerehabilitation that integrates citizen science and social information into physical exercise. We hypothesized that social information about others' contributions would augment engagement in physical activity by encouraging people to invest more effort toward discovery of novel information in a citizen science context. We recruited healthy participants to monitor the environment of a polluted canal by tagging images using a haptic device toward gathering environmental information. Along with the images, we displayed the locations of the tags created by the previous participants. We found that participants increased both the amount and duration of physical activity when presented with a larger number of the previous tags. Further, they increased the diversity of tagged objects by avoiding the locations tagged by the previous participants, thereby generating richer information about the environment. Our results suggest that social information is a viable means to augment engagement in rehabilitation exercise by incentivizing the contribution to scientific activities."
110,E,"Several studies have found that collaboration networks are scale-free, proposing that such networks can be modeled by specific network evolution mechanisms like preferential attachment. This study argues that collaboration networks can look more or less scale-free depending on the methods for resolving author name ambiguity in bibliographic data. Analyzing networks constructed from multiple datasets containing 3.4 M similar to 9.6 M publication records, this study shows that collaboration networks in which author names are disambiguated by the commonly used heuristic, i.e., forename-initial-based name matching, tend to produce degree distributions better fitted to power-law slopes with the typical scaling parameter (2 < alpha < 3) than networks disambiguated by more accurate algorithm-based methods. Such tendency is observed across collaboration networks generated under various conditions such as cumulative years, 5- and 1-year sliding windows, and random sampling, and through simulation, found to arise due mainly to artefactual entities created by inaccurate disambiguation. This cautionary study calls for special attention from scholars analyzing network data in which entities such as people, organization, and gene can be merged or split by improper disambiguation."
111,E,"Text reuse is becoming a serious issue in many fields and research shows that it is much harder to detect when it occurs across languages. The recent rise in multi-lingual content on the Web has increased cross-language text reuse to an unprecedented scale. Although researchers have proposed methods to detect it, one major drawback is the unavailability of large-scale gold standard evaluation resources built on real cases. To overcome this problem, we propose a cross-language sentence/passage level text reuse corpus for the English-Urdu language pair. The Cross-Language English-Urdu Corpus (CLEU) has source text in English whereas the derived text is in Urdu. It contains in total 3,235 sentence/passage pairs manually tagged into three categories that is near copy, paraphrased copy, and independently written. Further, as a second contribution, we evaluate the Translation plus Mono-lingual Analysis method using three sets of experiments on the proposed dataset to highlight its usefulness. Evaluation results (f(1)=0.732 binary, f(1)=0.552 ternary classification) indicate that it is harder to detect cross-language real cases of text reuse, especially when the language pairs have unrelated scripts. The corpus is a useful benchmark resource for the future development and assessment of cross-language text reuse detection systems for the English-Urdu language pair."
112,E,"The connections and contexts surrounding information shared in social settings must be accounted for, and this is particularly true for online communities that are information-centric. This article presents a mixed-methods study of LibraryThing and Goodreads, which have characteristics of information-centric online communities and social digital libraries, with attention to their roles as boundary objects, users' information values, and information behavior, and other boundaries and boundary objects at play. Content analysis of messages, a survey of users, and qualitative interviews show LibraryThing and Goodreads help establish community and organizational structure; support sharing of information values; and facilitate the building and maintenance of social ties. Translation of meanings and understandings within and between communities is a key activity in these roles. Online communities and social digital libraries should highlight translation processes and resources; provide user profiles and off-topic spaces and encourage their use; take a sociotechnical approach to tailor technology and community features to the right audiences; and facilitate the establishment of shared structure, values, and ties and the work of boundary spanners. Further implications exist for research on and theorizing of information-centric online communities, boundaries, and boundary objects as part of the sociotechnical infrastructure surrounding online information sharing."
113,E,"Open-access mega-journals (OAMJs) are characterized by their large scale, wide scope, open-access (OA) business model, and """"soundness-only"""" peer review. The last of these controversially discounts the novelty, significance, and relevance of submitted articles and assesses only their """"soundness."""" This article reports the results of an international survey of authors (n = 11,883), comparing the responses of OAMJ authors with those of other OA and subscription journals, and drawing comparisons between different OAMJs. Strikingly, OAMJ authors showed a low understanding of soundness-only peer review: two-thirds believed OAMJs took into account novelty, significance, and relevance, although there were marked geographical variations. Author satisfaction with OAMJs, however, was high, with more than 80% of OAMJ authors saying they would publish again in the same journal, although there were variations by title, and levels were slightly lower than subscription journals (over 90%). Their reasons for choosing to publish in OAMJs included a wide variety of factors, not significantly different from reasons given by authors of other journals, with the most important including the quality of the journal and quality of peer review. About half of OAMJ articles had been submitted elsewhere before submission to the OAMJ with some evidence of a """"cascade"""" of articles between journals from the same publisher."
114,E,"Two general challenges faced by data analysis are the existence of noise and the extraction of meaningful information from collected data. In this study, we used a multiscale framework to reduce the effects caused by noise and to extract explainable geometric properties to characterize finite metric spaces. We conducted lab experiments that integrated the use of eye-tracking, electrodermal activity (EDA), and user logs to explore users' information-seeking behaviors on search engine result pages (SERPs). Experimental results of 1,590 search queries showed that the proposed strategies effectively predicted query-level user satisfaction using EDA and eye-tracking data. The bootstrap analysis showed that combining EDA and eye-tracking data with user behavior data extracted from user logs led to a significantly better linear model fit than using user behavior data alone. Furthermore, cross-user and cross-task validations showed that our methods can be generalized to different search engine users performing different preassigned tasks."
115,E,"Research activities related to social informatics (SI) are expanding, even as community fragmentation, topical dispersion, and methodological diversity continue to increase. Specifically, the different understandings of SI in regional communities have strong impacts, and each has a different history, methodological grounding, and often a different thematic focus. The aim of this article is to connect three selected perspectives on SI-intellectual (regional schools of thought), methodological, and thematic-and introduce a comparative framework for understanding SI that includes all known approaches. Thus, the article draws from a thematic and methodological grounding of research across schools of thought, along with definitions that rely on the extension and intension of the notion of SI. The article is built on a paralogy of views and pluralism typical of postmodern science. Because SI is forced to continually reform its research focus, due to the rapid development of information and communication technology, social changes and ideologies that surround computerization and informatization, the presented perspective maintains a high degree of flexibility, without the need to constantly redefine the boundaries, as is typical in modern science. This approach may support further developments in promoting and understanding SI worldwide."
116,E,"The materiality of information environments, and its role in information behavior, has received little attention. We present an ethnographic study involving 156 hours of observation and 28 patient interviews in outpatient hemodialysis facilities. Using an extended """"Semiotic Framework for Information Systems Research,"""" the findings show that objects, spaces, and bodies were integral to 6 sociomaterial layers of facility information environments: the physical, empiric, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic, and social world. Objects of importance in the information environments included dialysis machines, instruments, records, paper documents, televisions, furniture, thermostats, lighting, and personal possessions. Spatial features, including compartmentalization, displays, distance, proximity, and spatially-grounded routines, also constituted information environments. The information environments were also shaped by patient immobility, bodily discomforts, and orientation to bodily states. Each sociomaterial layer introduced enablers and constraints to information access, flow, and acceptance; these combined to construct patients primarily as passive recipients of information rather than active seekers and producers of information. A sociomaterial perspective and related focus on objects, spaces, and bodies offers a lens for professional information practice. We contribute information environment design guidance to facilitate such practice and stress that the value of certain sources and types of information can be materially encoded in an environment."
117,E,"Value perception increases when people engage in producing physical objects. However, information differs from physical objects by being intangible and easy-to-copy. Information as an experience good is inherently challenging to evaluate a priori; therefore, comparing value before and after different types of experience is likely to inform theory about users' preferences regarding information. Prior research mostly refers to consuming information and rarely considers the experience of producing information as a factor affecting information value. The current research compares the effect of experiencing online information through production and consumption processes on value perception. In a set of 6 experiments with 178 participants, willingness-to-pay by consumers and willingness-to-accept payment by producers are measured before and after consumption and production of information, independently and as repeated measures. In the experiments, we define and implement a framework for an information production process. The results show that the value of information is dynamic. Value perception increased after experiencing information, especially when people engaged in producing information compared to consuming it. This study offers a window toward the practical design of new digital information products."
118,E,"Human spatial concepts, such as the concept of place, are not immediately translatable to the geometric foundations of spatial databases and information systems developed over the past 50 years. These systems typically rest on the concepts of objects and fields, both bound to coordinates, as two general paradigms of geographic representation. The match between notions of place occurring in everyday where questions and the data available to answer such questions is unclear and hinders progress in place-based information systems. This is particularly true in novel application areas such as the Digital Humanities or speech-based human-computer interaction, but also for location-based services. Although this shortcoming has been observed before, we approach the challenges of relating places to information system representations with a fresh view, based on a set of core concepts of spatial information. These concepts have been proposed in information science with the intent of serving human-machine spatial question asking and answering. Clarifying the relationship of the notion of place to these concepts is a significant step toward geographically intelligent systems. The main result of the article is a demonstration that the notion of place fits existing concepts of spatial information, when these are adequately exploited and combined."
119,E,"We examine how opinion distributions (i.e., opinion polarization and convergence over time) differ across product salient platforms (product platforms) versus product non-salient platforms (non-product platforms). Drawing on the theory of impression management, we hypothesize and explain when and why consumers choose to post their comments on different platforms, and how their behavior will be affected when they choose to post on online platforms. To test the hypotheses, we collected and text-mined online posts from product platforms such as review aggregator sites, discussion forums, and consumer rating websites, and non-product platforms such as microblogs. The results showed that product platforms have more polarized opinions, and exhibit more convergence in opinion across time, compared with non-product platforms. Our findings advise researchers and practitioners to pay attention to the characteristics of online platforms, and how users' perceptions of the purpose of the online platform may affect their online posting behavior."
120,E,"It is a frequently seen scenario that when people are not familiar with their search topics, they use a simple keyword search, which leads to a large amount of search results in multiple pages. This makes it difficult for users to pick relevant documents, especially given that they are not knowledgeable of the topics. To explore how systems can better help users find relevant documents from search results, the current research analyzed document selection behaviors of users with different levels of domain knowledge (DK). Data were collected in a laboratory study with 35 participants each searching on four tasks in the genomics domain. The results show that users with high and low DK levels selected different sets of documents to view; those high in DK read more documents and gave higher relevance ratings for the viewed documents than those low in DK did. Users with low DK tended to select documents ranking toward the top of the search result lists, and those with high in DK tended to also select documents ranking down the search result lists. The findings help design search systems that can personalize search results to users with different levels of DK."
121,F,"The rapid development of e-commerce in China has played a critical role in the development of the national economy and ongoing modernization. The plant industry is unique among industries that employ e-commerce sales models because its products exhibit special characteristics such as high death and damage rates. Therefore, its e-commerce and logistical requirements are stricter than in other industries and, as a result, excess warehouse storage can be extremely difficult for e-commerce-based plant shops to manage. Numerous studies have indicated the need to identify a product's most up-to-date market conditions, as well as the type, function, and size of warehouses. Therefore, based on a case study, this study proposes an optimization plan for solving excess warehouse storage in e-commerce-based plant shops. First, sales volume data of the case company, Enterprise A, were analyzed to predict future sales. Then, entropy and the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution were used to construct the decision-making model. Finally, a cloud warehouse-based optimization plan was proposed to solve excess warehouse storage in e-commerce-based plant shops. This plan can serve as a reference for decision-makers or executives in e-commerce-based plant shops when handling excess warehouse storage."
122,F,"Having forecast of real estate sales done correctly is very important for balancing supply and demand in the housing market. However, it is very difficult for housing companies or real estate professionals to determine how many houses they will sell next year. Although this does not mean that a prediction plan cannot be created, the studies conducted both in Turkey and different countries about the housing sector are focused more on estimating housing prices. Especially the developing technological advances allow making estimations in many areas. That is why the purpose of this study is both to provide guiding information to the companies in the sector and to contribute to the literature. In this study, a 124-month data set belonging to the 2008 (1)-2018 (4) period has been taken into account for total housing sales in Turkey. In order to estimate the time series of sales, ARIMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average as linear model), LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory as nonlinear model) has been used. As to increase the estimation, a HYBRID (LSTM and ARIMA) model created has been used in the application. When MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) and MSE (Mean Squared Error) values obtained from each of these methods were compared, the best performance with the lowest error rate proved to be the HYBRID model, and the fact that all the application models have very close results shows the success of predictability. This is an indication that our study will contribute significantly to the literature."
123,F,"This paper studies the dynamic impacts of financial development, human capital, and economic growth on CO2 emission intensity in China for the period 1978-2015, with a structural breakpoint in 1992, by employing an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach. The estimations show that there exists a long-run cointegration linkage among the variables, with three main findings. First, financial openness measured by net FDI inflows can significantly reduce CO2 emission intensity in both the short-term and the long-term, whereas the effects of both financial scale and financial efficiency are limited and insignificant. Second, there exists an inverted N-shaped relationship between human capital and CO2 emission intensity: improving human capital first decreases CO(2)emission intensity (before 1992), then increases it in the short-run (after 1992), and, finally lessens it in the long-run. Last, raising per capita income can also significantly lower CO2 emission intensity in the long-run. Accordingly, some policy implications are also discussed."
124,F,"With the embedding of internet technology, the entrepreneurial model has been gradually developing from traditional single linear channel into network platform with symbiotic multi-platform. Platform leadership is the most important part of the new one and has been caught greatest attention. This paper put forward a new conception of network entrepreneurial platform leadership innovatively. By the integrated use of the Classical Grounded theory, the Procedure Grounded Theory and the Construction Grounded Theory, it adopted the normative research process of open coding, axial coding and selective coding to refine 34 concept - multi-node interactive, cross-level coupling relationship, etc, and formed 11 fundamental categories which include platform leadership power, network organization entrepreneurial mode, etc. Then, we analyzed the interactions between categories, based on which, a double-level and three-type-characteristics model were ultimately built. The study was finished by both two methods of statistical software and manual operation. In order to improve the reliability and validity of the study, it invited another coder to test the category subordination collaboratively, and used matched group to test the theoretical saturation."
125,F,"This paper studies the volatility spillover and dynamic correlation between EU emission allowance (EUA) prices and energy prices by considering three energy commodities, including oil, gas, and coal. The asymmetric BEKK model is employed for multi-phase analysis of EU ETS, yet only a little empirical evidence backing up the existence of volatility spillover between EU ETS and energy markets, i.e., the establishments of the EU ETS may not effectively restrict and influence energy markets. The time-varying conditional correlation between EUA and each of energy prices is analyzed. The dynamic correlation shows there is a relatively stable, positive correlation between the EUA and Brent oil, natural gas. However, modeling the dynamics correlation also suggests that the correlation between the EUA and the natural gas, coal became weaker and more volatile since second and third phases, especially after the Global Financial Crisis in 2008, which may indicate that the demand reduction in emission allowances caused by the economic slowdown far exceeds the reduction in the annual restraint of EU ETS."
126,F,"This paper helps to achieve a better understanding of the relationships among organizational behaviors, capabilities and the intangible resources of firms as a micro-level origin of the internationalization of enterprises. The resource-based view, strategic management theory, knowledge absorption and establishment practice, trade show issues and model theory development are integrated and implications offered for both scholars and practitioners. It integrates a research model based on trade show practices, and concentrates on the experimental conditions targeted by the respondents. The mediating roles of enterprises' intangible resources are also discussed. Based on a sample of trade development groups, 256 completed questionnaires were used to examine the hypotheses. The hypotheses were tested using structural equation models. The findings show that relationship building positively influences relationship performance. The relationship performance has a significant mediating role on the effects of information sharing on international performance. Moreover, commitment to learning and high absorptive capacity of a firm determines the innovation performance of firms and contributes to their international performance."
127,F,"In the article the authors attempted to develop the neoclassical model of economic growth, repealing two assumptions regarding the Solow growth model. First of all, the authors assume that the growth path of the number of employees is increasing asymptotically to a fixed value, not to infinity as in the Solow model. The growth paths of the number of employees were determined based on demographic forecasts and the economic activity coefficient, which in the paper is understood as the ratio of the number of employees to the number of people. Secondly, the authors repeal the assumption of a fixed investment rate by taking into account the trend of changes in investment rates (a growing or declining trend). The theoretical model obtained was subjected to calibration and then numerical simulations were carried out. It was assumed that investment rates in the Polish economy decrease (from 25 to 15%) or grow (from 15 to 25%). Numerical simulations were based on demographic forecasts for the Polish economy up to 2050. Moreover, two scenarios for shaping the economic activity coefficient were considered: realistic one when in the period 2000-2050 it increased from 0.38 to 0.5. In the second scenario, it was optimistic that the increase would be 50% higher than in the first option and in 2050 it would reach 0.56. Important conclusions from the study can be presented as follows: (i) the population decline can be offset by the growing economic activity rate and therefore does not have a negative impact on economic growth, (ii) the negative impact of demographic changes on economic growth can also be offset by growing investment rates."
128,F,"As the world's largest importer, trading of iron ore occupies a pivotal position in China's international trade. In order to seek the decision power of deciding the price for iron ore, China's Dalian Commodity Exchange (DCE) listed iron ore futures in October 2013, which has become the world's largest iron ore financial derivatives trading market now. Based on VECM and state-space perspective, this paper aims to explore the price discovery function of iron ore futures on the DCE. Comprehensive analysis from the views of long-term equilibrium relationship, short-term information shocks and dynamic contribution share are made in this paper. The empirical results show that: firstly, from the perspective of cointegration test, there is a long-term equilibrium relationship between the futures prices in DCE and the spot prices; secondly, when facing with short-term information shocks, iron ore futures in DCE have an obviously price discovery function by the analysis of impulse response and variance decomposition; finally, by the way of state-space and Kalman filter algorithm, the long-term equilibrium relationship dynamic contribution for price discovery function of DCE's iron ore futures remains stable between 60% and 70% now."
129,F,"This paper investigates the effects of the renewable energy consumption and the tourism investments along with the per capita gross domestic product (GDP), the real effective exchange rate, and trade openness on both tourism revenues (total tourism contribution to GDP) and international tourist arrivals in the sample of the G20 members. The annual data from 1995 to 2015 and the panel econometric techniques are utilized to achieve the objectives of the current paper. The results for the long-run elasticities from the panel fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) estimations suggest that the renewable energy uses and tourism investments have a considerable positive impact on both the tourism revenues and the tourist arrivals. Given these results, it is argued that promoting both renewable energy and tourism investments should be considered as the major driving forces of tourism development in the G20 countries. Given these arguments, policymakers should initiate more of sustainable tourism development policies, which may assist those countries to expand the tourism industry further."
130,F,"The aim of this article is to investigate the impacts of cooperative and non-cooperative R&D strategies on product innovation and firm performance. Based on the industrial economics literature and the optimisation model, R&D competition, R&D cartelisation, and full industry cartelisation strategies of firms operating on a market with differentiated goods and simultaneous price and quality competition are considered. It is showed that R&D cartelisation entails a loss of firm's product innovation compared with R&D competition. However, profit-maximising firms do not prefer the R&D competition strategy. They prefer to pursue either R&D cartelisation or full industry cartelisation strategies, depending on the elasticity of demand with respect to the firm's investment in R&D. The social cost of R&D cartelisation is a loss of product innovation, and the social cost of full industry cartelisation is both the loss of product innovation and the loss of consumer surplus due to a relatively high price and low output of the final product. The latter results carry significant implications for the modern business and public policy."
131,F,"This study aims to identify public financial indicators involved in the investment projects of GCC countries. The data was collected from the IMF and the MEED from 2011-2017. The study measured the impact of public finance based on eight variables and two proxies (national and trade accounts) on the investment project development proxy, which is measured by the total value of projects planned or currently underway and the value of the ten largest projects currently underway. The results showed that Saudi Arabia and the UAE rank high in both proxies of investment project development. The simple regression results also illustrated that real GDP, the real non-oil GDP variables of national account proxy, and the value of the exported goods and services variable of the trade accounts proxy have a significant impact on the total value of projects planned or currently underway. Meanwhile, only three factors of national accounts, gross national savings, CPI inflation, and current account balance, have a significant impact on the value of the ten largest projects currently underway. The overall conclusion of the study is that GCC countries have established high-value development projects in different cities that require a proper public policy to efficiently manage capital expenditure within the public sector."
132,F,"Market knowledge is recognised as an important predictor of new product performance, which existing studies have proven. However, a missing link in this relationship is creativity, and specifically, as a natural process in product innovation. This study aims to examine a model that includes two mediating mechanisms between market knowledge scope and two new product outcomes, respectively: a new product's competitive advantage and its commercial success. In both cases two mediators are used that represent dimensions of creativity - i.e. a product's meaningfulness and novelty. The model was tested on a sample of 374 Polish medium-high- and high-technology companies using structural equation modelling. The results indicated that market knowledge is transferred to both new product outcomes through new product creativity, albeit somewhat differently. The first mediating mechanism, which explains the factor of competitive advantage, operates only through the indirect effects of both the product's meaningfulness and its novelty. The second mechanism works directly, through the market knowledge's effect on commercial success, as well as indirectly, through product meaningfulness. Subsequently, theoretical and managerial implications as well as indications for future research are provided based on these findings."
133,F,"Economic development of countries, regions or entities operating on the market is possible when favourable economic conditions outweigh adverse conditions. Examining the development of European economy, it is possible to observe this regularity in the majority of periods, i.e. the bull market had a more intense and longer impact on the economy in comparison with the bear market, enabling constant economic development of Europe. Globalisation, a relative ease of financing investment activity, financial over-liquidity, negative interest rates: all of them result in the fact that previously verified and correctly operating mechanisms and market models have become unpredictable. During the latest crisis, the European real property market lost some part of its potential. The loss varied in individual EU member-countries. Some of them coped with the crisis quite successfully, others managed to do so on the average, still others have felt its effects until today. Making use of regressive techniques, the author undertook to measure and assess the impact of the global crisis on the property market. Consequently, the effects and intensity of its impact regarding the number of issued building permits, number of the employed in construction industry, value of construction production and prices of real property were measured."
134,F,"A financial report restatement reflects errors in the previous financial statement, and thus it increases investors' doubt about the credibility of the financial statement. The primary objective of this paper is to examine whether restatement announcements imply increased fraud risks in Chinese firms in the context that up to one quarter of listed companies have restated their financial reports in China, and explore the implications of the content, severity and reasons for restatements with respect to fraud. In this paper, firms with financial restatements prove to be more likely to be labeled as fraudulent by regulators in China. Second, the following results also are revealed: (1) financial statements, except balance sheet restatements, provide insights into the revelation of fraudulent behaviors, (2) the severity of restatements is positively correlated with future fraud disclosures, and (3) restatements due to negligence are positively correlated with future fraud occurrences. These results imply that restatement announcements and their different characteristics provide important information for detecting financial statement fraud."
135,F,"Performance measurement encourages Decision Making Units (DMUs) to improve their level of performance by comparing their current financial positions with that of their peers. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is a widely used approach to performance measurement, though it is susceptible when the data is heterogeneous. The main objective of this study is to examine the performance of Mongolian listed companies by combining DEA and a k-medoid clustering method. Clustering facilitates the characterization and patterns of data and identification of homogenous groups. This study applies the integration of k-medoids and performance measurement. The research used 89 Mongolian companies' financial statements from 2012 to 2015 - obtained from the Mongolian Stock Exchange website. The companies are grouped by k-medoids clustering, and efficiency of each cluster is evaluated by DEA. According to the silhouette method, the companies are classified into two clusters which are considered first cluster as small and medium-sized (80), and second cluster as big (9) companies. Both clusters are analyzed and compared by financial ratios. The mean efficiency score of big companies' is much higher than that of small and medium-sized companies. Integrated results show that cluster-specific efficiency provides better performance than pre-clustering efficiency results."
136,F,"This paper assesses the relationship between carbon emissions, economic growth and, energy consumption, in USA and China from the perspective of Granger causality, in a multivariate framework controlling for financial development, urbanization, and trade openness. Econometric techniques employed include unit root tests, Toda and Yamamoto Granger causality, and generalized impulse response and variance decomposition analysis for the time horizon 1980-2017. Test results indicate that governments of the USA and China cannot implement sturdier strategic energy policies in the long run without inhibiting the growth of the economy because of the bidirectional causative linkage between economic growth and energy use. A causal link does not exist between carbon emissions and financial development for both countries. Nevertheless, in the USA, there exists a unidirectional Granger causality controlling from energy consumption to financial development. In both economies, urbanization Granger causes CO2 emissions and energy use but the reverse does not hold. An upsurge in energy consumption and carbon emissions will lead to a surge in trade openness but not vice versa for China. A noteworthy result is that there is a substantiation of unidirectional causality from energy consumption to carbon emissions in both countries. In the USA, impulse response and variance decomposition analysis disclosed the effect of financial development is projected to have diminutive magnitude whiles in the future, energy use, economic growth, trade openness, and urbanization would influence carbon emissions significantly. The impacts of trade openness and financial development are expected to be of little importance in China. The general findings implied that urbanization, economic growth, and energy consumption influenced CO2 emissions significantly in the USA and China. Understanding these similar and contrasting situations is essential to reaching a global agreement on climate change affecting IMF's top 2 biggest economies."
137,F,"This paper applies the composite construction method proposed by Haugen (1999) and its application by Zhao and Wang (2010) for the Chinese stock market. Utilizing the Shanghai A-share market stocks data, this paper first selects the studying samples from January 1, 1997 to December 31, 2017. A portfolio is then built according to the mean variance model of portfolio structure, and simulation results are analysed using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. The relationship between risk and return in the long and short term is explored. Results indicate no significant relationship between the risk and return of the stock portfolio in the short run, which reflects the short-term ambiguity of the Chinese stock market. However, in the long run, the risk and return of the stock portfolios are positively correlated, which means that high returns are accompanied by high risks, indicating that the stock market will eventually return to rationality. In other words, the A-share stock market will eventually return to be value-driven and the short-term speculators would be outweighed by long-term value investors."
138,F,"In the past decade, the importance of social media has increased, especially in knowledge sharing practices. Current massive evolution of computer-mediated communication platforms influenced the ways of how knowledge is managed and shared by individuals. This literature review of published papers in the past decade explores the potential of using social media in knowledge sharing by individuals and, through the mapping of the existing studies, identifies research opportunities for future studies. Primary, tacit and explicit knowledge sharing have been investigated. The findings suggest that there are different ways in which knowledge is shared across social media, but the systematic approach and synthesis is challenging to define. Therefore, there are some open courses of future research that may form the basis for a theoretical framework. The results of the present literature review should increase methodological rigor, and provide the guidelines to academics by identifying research opportunities. They can also serve as a comprehensive collection of findings for knowledge management decision makers."
139,F,"The aim of manuscript is to analyze and identify determinants of honest accounting errors leading to financial restatements based on data from SEC database and from annual reports. Reason for this study is that accounting errors are expensive for companies that need to change already published financial statements and have impact on company reputation and stock price. Most of authors focus on prediction of accounting frauds and financial restatements remain in the background of research. 'I his study initially tests existing accounting fraud detection model of Beneish on a sample of 40 financial restatement companies over 10 years and develops two new pioneer prediction models, one based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and another based on logistic regression. In testing dataset, LDA model has achieved accuracy 70.96%, specificity 25.00% and sensitivity 79.83% and logistic regression model has achieved accuracy 62.22%, specificity 41.66% and sensitivity 66.67%, performance of both models is better than existing Beneish model or other studies in this field. Developed models can be widely used by both internal and external users of financial statements, who would like to determine if financial statements of analyzed company include accounting errors or not, thanks to easily interpretable results in equation form."
140,G,"Objectives: African countries are potential high growth markets for the alcohol and tobacco industries. This study aimed to identify exposures that are associated with initiating use of alcohol and tobacco products in young people living in Ethiopia. As televised football and Internet viewing are media through which products can be promoted to this population efficiently, these risk factors were of particular interest. Study design: This is a cross-sectional study. Methods: Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire of 3967 children aged 13-19 years in 20 high schools in urban and rural Ethiopia on consumption and risk factors for alcohol and tobacco use in 2016, as well as exposure to potential sources of advertising. Results: Eight percent of respondents reported having ever smoked and 3% were current smokers. Twenty-nine percent reported ever having used alcohol, and 14% were current users. Risk factors for ever smoking included father smoking (odds ratio [OR] 1.95; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.21 to 3.15), mother smoking (OR 3.90; 95% CI: 1.63 to 9.33), best friend smoking (OR 5.86; 95% CI: 4.31 to 7.96) and home Internet access (OR 1.75; 95% CI: 1.35 to 2.27). There was a very strong positive association between ever having smoked cigarettes and ever having tried alcohol (P < 0.001). Risk factors for currently drinking alcohol included father drinking (OR 1.45; 95% CI: 1.05 to 2.01), mother drinking (OR 2.00; 95% CI: 1.44 to 2.77), home Internet access (OR 1.53; 95% CI: 1.24 to 1.90) and regular watching of televised football (OR 2.44 compared to those who do not; 95% CI: 1.58 to 3.78). Conclusions: As in rich countries, tobacco and alcohol use among Ethiopian teenagers increases among those exposed to family and peer use but are also more common among those accessing the Internet and, for alcohol, those watching televised football. The effect of watching televised football on alcohol use, at least, is likely to be due to exposure to advertising. (C) 2019 The Authors.

141,G,"Objectives: This study aimed to identify factors associated with attempting to quit and successful smoking cessation in a population-based sample of Brazilian smokers. Study design: This is a prospective cohort study. Methods: Data came from the first two waves of the International Tobacco Control Brazil Survey, conducted in 2009 and 2012/2013 in three cities: Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, and Porto Alegre. Data were collected from 488 adults (aged >= 18 years) who smoked at Wave 1 and who were resurveyed at Wave 2. Crude and adjusted relative risks for two outcomes (making a quit attempt between Wave 1 and Wave 2 and successfully quitting by Wave 2) were estimated. Multivariable multilevel logistic regression models were used, whereby variables were added to the models in a series of blocks. Results: Nearly two-thirds (65.6%) of smokers attempted to quit between waves, and 23.4% had quit at Wave 2. Intention to quit smoking at Wave 1 was the only variable associated with attempt to quit by Wave 2 (odds ratio [OR] = 2.85; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.64-4.94; P < 0.001). Smokers of higher socio-economic status (OR high versus low = 1.80; 95% CI 1.05-3.10; P = 0.03) and lower nicotine dependence (OR low Heaviness of Smoking Index [HSI] versus high HSI = 1.94; 95% CI 1.10-3.43; P = 0.02) were more likely to successfully quit. The presence of another adult smoker at home was negatively related to successful quitting (OR = 0.50; 95% CI 0.26-0.94; P = 0.03). Conclusions: These results are generally consistent with prior research and have potential to inform governmental interventions to promote tobacco cessation, particularly among disadvantaged groups.

142,G,"Objectives: To examine the impacts of housing discrimination experienced by Indigenous postsecondary students on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomology and perceptions of university stress. Study design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: Data were gathered via in-person surveys completed by 142 Indigenous students between 2015 and 2017. Associations were analyzed using phi coefficients and linear regression models adjusted for confounders. Qualitative data were examined using thematic analyses. Results: Indigenous students who had children (almost 50% of the sample), were living with a romantic partner, and/or were between the ages of 25-44 years experienced significantly more racially-motivated housing discrimination than other Indigenous students in the sample. The frequency of housing discrimination in the past 12 months was significantly associated with increased PTSD symptoms; particularly, intrusive recollection and more perceived stress at university in linear regression models adjusted for confounders. Every 1-point increase in the frequency of housing discrimination on a 4-point scale resulted in a 5.4-point increase in PTSD score. Although living with a romantic partner resulted in more housing discrimination, it also served as a resilience factor, buffering the impact of housing discrimination on PTSD symptomology. Qualitative data indicated students faced Racially-motivated housing discrimination that was blunt and deliberate and highlighted the resourceful ways students sought to resist it. Conclusions: Racially-motivated housing discrimination exacerbated PTSD symptomology among Indigenous students and adversely impacted perceptions of their university experience. Efforts are needed to address housing discrimination directly, as well as provide greater family-focused housing and mental wellness supports to Indigenous students to reduce potential impacts of this public health problem on postsecondary success and degree completion.

143,G,"Objectives: The primary objective of this study was to work with tribal communities to define and develop their own healthcare services and strategies for positive change regarding injection drug use, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The secondary objective of this study was to incorporate community capacity building strategies to develop and sustain programming and resources to optimize tribal communities' responsiveness to reduce health disparities. Study design: Semi-structured qualitative interviews. Methods: Interviews were guided by community-based participatory research (CBPR) principles to create programs, projects, and policy recommendations meaningful to American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) people. Results: The study generated a formative understanding of the context of AI/AN people who inject drugs (PWID) in three distinct AI/AN communities as well as developed local capacity for future programming, projects, and policy. Conclusions: This study confirms CBPR methods should be part of an iterative cycle to inform policy and programs. CBPR has helped strengthen local research capacity and has formed ongoing relationships between study investigators, local liaisons, and the community that will be essential for next phases of program design and policy implementation. This cycle of CBPR could be replicated in other tribal communities to bring awareness of the opioid epidemic and its effects and to prioritize local indigenous and community-led responses.

144,G,"Objectives: The aim of this article is to explore perceptions of weight and racism towards Maori, as an indigenous group, and the association between the two. We then propose indigenous solutions as pathways out of fat shaming. Study design: This is a conceptual article supported by a review of literature in the fields of weight stigma, racism and indigenous (Maori) health. Methods: This article is taken from the perspective of three researchers involved in Maori health research, studies on institutional and societal racism and critical research on weight stigma and the weight loss industry. Indigenous peoples in developed nations are more likely to be overweight, obese and disproportionately affected by the comorbidities and physical disorders associated with weight when compared with their counterparts. Beyond the physical ailments are a variety of psychological, emotional and social issues, which are associated with being 'fat ' and/or overweight and/or from subsequent stigmatisation. Results: Long before this world's populations reached the current alarming level of obesity, indigenous peoples in colonised countries were stigmatised because of the colour of their skin, their beliefs and their culture. Stigma is nothing new to indigenous peoples, and so when Maori, or any other indigenous groups are told they are fat and less productive (or moral) because of 'fatness', there is no surprise because they have been told the same thing (albeit for a different reason) for generations. Considering the relatively high proportion of indigenous people in New Zealand, North America and beyond who do not fit the 'recommended weight range', the justification for racist sentiment is seemingly strengthened. Conclusions: A weight loss-centred approach to health has not improved the health of indigenous people. Initiatives that draw on, or are underpinned by local, traditional knowledge are more relevant for indigenous peoples and could lead to better health outcomes for these groups.

145,G,"Objective: The objective of this study was to identify priority social factors contributing to indigenous cardiometabolic diseases. Study design: A three-round Delphi process was used to consolidate and compare the opinions of 60 experts in indigenous cardiometabolic health from Australia, New Zealand and the United States. Methods: Round one: three open-ended questions: (i) historical, (ii) economic and (iii) sociocultural factor contributors to cardiometabolic disease risk. Round two: a structured questionnaire based on the results from the first round; items were ranked according to perceived importance. Final round: the items were reranked after receiving the summary feedback. Results: Several key findings were identified: (i) an important historical factor is marginalisation and disempowerment; (ii) in terms of economic and sociocultural factors, the panellists came to the consensus that the socio-economic status and educational inequalities are important; and (iii) while consensus was not reached, economic and educational factors were also perceived to be historically influential. Conclusion: These findings support the need for multilevel health promotion policy. For example, tackling financial barriers that limit the access to health-promoting resources, combined with improving literacy skills to permit understanding of health education.

146,G,"Objectives: To engage with health providers and Aboriginal women to understand what educational resources they want and need to support quit smoking attempts during pregnancy in order to develop a comprehensive evidence-based intervention. Study design: Resources were developed in partnership with Aboriginal people, communities and academics with the aim to be inclusive of diverse communities. We then recruited Aboriginal women of various ages for yarning circles (focus groups) held in three Australian states to explore the acceptability of the resources and seeking further guidance as to the needs of Aboriginal women to support smoking cessation during pregnancy. Methods: Yarning circles were recorded and transcribed, and data were analysed independently by two researchers. Responses were coded using predetermined themes and further general inductive analysis for emergent themes. Results: Twenty-four Aboriginal women reflected on the resources they included: one pregnant woman, 15 mothers and eight elders. Predetermined themes of attraction, comprehension, cultural acceptability, graphics and layout, persuasion and self-efficacy were explored. Women suggested the following: resources need to be visually attractive and interactive to enhance self-efficacy; additional scientific content on health consequences of smoking and combining with non-pharmacological approaches to quitting. Conclusion: Indigenous peoples prefer culturally targeted messages. However, developing effective Aboriginal health promotion requires more than a 'culturally appropriate' adaptation of mainstream resources. Consideration needs to be given to the diversity of Aboriginal communities when developing effective, evidence-based interventions. Aboriginal women are calling for innovative and interactive resources that enhance self-efficacy; the use of videos to explain medical and informational brochure content is well received. Requests for non-pharmacological cessation options were reported in New South Wales and Queensland and should be further explored. (C) 2018 The Authors.

147,G,"Objectives: Mediation analyses were conducted to explore the contribution of lifestyle behaviours in the ethnic pattern of poor health outcomes in Leicester, England. Study design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: The study used data on 1959 participants from the Leicester Health and Wellbeing Survey (2015). Lifestyle behaviours were physical activity, diet, smoking and alcohol drinking. Poor health outcomes were the presence of long-term illness and poor self-reported health. Results: Poor health outcomes were less common in Black and Minority Ethnic groups (BMEs) than Whites. Smoking was less common in BMEs than Whites. Poor health outcomes were more common in ex-smokers and current smokers than never smokers. Health outcomes were associated with smoking even after adjusting for ethnicity. The association of ethnicity and health outcomes reduced after adjusting for smoking, suggesting that the effect was mediated by smoking. Conclusions: In Leicester, Whites had poorer health outcomes than BMEs, which were not mediated by physical activity, diet and alcohol drinking but were mediated by smoking.

148,G,"Objectives: Nationally representative studies suggest 1-2% of Indonesian women (2.3 million) smoke various tobacco products daily; however, in recent years, there has been concern that the tobacco industry has successfully increased female smoking. Our objective was to describe current cigarette smoking behaviors, past quit attempts, and intention to quit of female daily smokers in Surabaya, Indonesia. Study design: Survey. Methods: Female daily smokers (n = 112) in Surabaya, Indonesia, the country's second largest city, were recruited to participate in a survey during 2018. Convenience sampling was utilized in two malls. Potential participants were intercepted in or near designated smoking areas and invited to the nearby data collection site. Survey items from Global Adult Tobacco Survey and the International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation Project were utilized. Results: Participants self-reported smoking 13.8 cigarettes per day (7.3 white machine-rolled cigarettes per day, 4.2 kreteks per day, and 2.4 roll-your-own cigarettes per day). Over 75% smoked their first cigarette within 30 min of waking. Over 53% had a heaviness of smoking index score suggesting moderate or high addiction. Approximately half (51%) did not attempt to quit smoking in the previous 12 months, and 55% planned to quit beyond 6 months or not at all. Conclusions: Our sample smoked five to six more cigarettes per day than female daily smokers in previous national surveys. Relative to previous studies, our data suggest an unexpected preference for white machine-rolled cigarettes and that there could be, at a minimum, pockets of increased smoking and addiction among female daily smokers in Indonesia.

149,G,Objectives: Ethno-national approaches to research public health and migrant outcomes have dominated for decades but lack efficacy in a globalised world and in view of the intractable nature of health outcome inequalities for migrant and minority groups. This article highlights some of the challenges and opportunities associated with a superdiversity perspective in public health research. Superdiversity and ethno-national approaches: Migration patterns have changed with more people arriving from more places and the diversification of diversity meaning that the ethno-national categories utilised in public health research have reduced explanatory potential. The example of maternal and perinatal mortality in the United Kingdom: Adjusting UK perinatal mortality rates by five ethnic groups based on assumptions of relationships between high levels of risk and ethnic groups masks the scale of inequality faced by groups wherein mortality rates are increasing and highlights some of the difficulties associated with using ethno-national classifications. A superdiversity perspective: A superdiversity approach moves beyond ethno-nationalism to socially locate groups focussing on commonalities and differences across spaces and characteristics and employing intracategorical or anticategorical approaches. Conclusions: Superdiversity brings new levels of demographic complexity and fluidity. Greater reflexivity is needed in diversity research with justification of classifications used for analysis necessary when research questions are developed.

150,G,"Objectives: To counter the attractiveness of cigarettes, Article 11 of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control provides for the possibility of including warnings on cigarettes. The objective of our research was to explore perceptions of cigarettes designed to be dissuasive (displaying the warning 'Smoking kills' in uppercase or lowercase, a 'skull and crossbones' pictogram, unattractive shades of brown or dark green or a combination of all these negative cues). Study design: In-depth interviews were conducted with 31 people in France aged 15-25 years (10 daily smokers, 10 occasional smokers and 11 non-smokers; 15 females and 16 males). Methods: Participants were shown different dissuasive cigarettes (displaying the warning Smoking kills', a 'skull and crossbones' pictogram, unattractive shades of brown or dark green or a combination of all three) and current branded ones. Open-ended questions were asked about the attractiveness of the cigarettes, perception of risk, the image of the smoker and influence on the desire to quit or not to start. Discussions were audio-recorded and transcribed. Results: The different dissuasive cues were found to increase negative health perceptions (e.g., increase risk), reduce positive smoker image and the perceived pleasure of smoking (e.g., embarrassment of smoking in front of friends), decrease the desire to start smoking and increase the desire to quit. The most dissuasive cigarette was an unattractively dark-coloured cigarette which displayed both the warning 'Smoking kills' and a 'skull and crossbones' pictogram. Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of the appearance of cigarettes and suggests that dissuasive cigarettes may be an innovative tobacco control measure for governments.

151,G,"Background: Epidemic obesity poses a major threat to global health. This phenomenon reflects the inability of the average person to cope, biologically and behaviorally, with environmental contexts that promote caloric overconsumption and inadequate caloric expenditure. There is still much to be learned about how to improve these contexts nationally and within-countries for sociodemographic groups with above-average obesity risks. Methods: Higher obesity risks relative to respective white majority populations were identified among diverse indigenous, other native-born, or migrant 'racial' or ethnic minority (hereafter, ethnic minority) populations in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands, using publicly available national survey data or other sources. Cross-national comparisons were of interest for identifying common risk pathways associated with social and economic inequities. Potential explanations were explored through a narrative review of peer-reviewed literature, informed by the World Health Organization's Conceptual Framework for Action on The Social Determinants of Health. Main findings: Identifying viable solutions to the high risk of obesity in ethnic minority populations in these high-income countries requires examination of national-level social, economic, and health system contexts, food systems, and built environments for physical activity, as well as patterns of social stratification and cultural biases related to ethnicity, migration, and other determinants of social disadvantage. These factors can be linked to mediators of exposure or vulnerability to obesity-related risks, such as poverty, being an 'outsider', stress and trauma resulting from historical and current oppression, exposure to bias and discrimination, related biological or behavioral consequences, and inadequate health and social care. Conclusions: Focusing on ethnic minority populations in high-income countries is critical for public health efforts to address epidemic obesity. Mitigating intersecting risk pathways arising from stratification and bias based on ethnicity and migrant status should be prominent in these efforts. (c) 2019 The Royal Society for Public Health.

152,G,"Objectives: The purpose of this study is to show that social distancing is a public good under the COVID-19 pandemic. Study design: We apply economic theory to analyse a cross-sectional survey. Methods: Economic theory is complemented with empirical evidence. An online survey of those aged 30-49 years in Japan (n = 2177) was conducted between April 28 and May 7. Respondents were selected by quota sampling with regard to age group, gender and prefecture of residence. Our main figure shows the proportion of people who increased/did not change/decreased social distancing, relative to the level of altruism and sensitivity to public shaming. The results of OLS and logit models are shown in Supplementary Materials. Results: Social distancing is a public good under the COVID-19 pandemic for which the free-rider problem is particularly severe. Altruism and social norms are crucial factors in overcoming this problem. Using an original survey, we show that people with higher altruistic concerns and sensitivity to shaming are more likely to follow social distancing measures. Conclusions: Altruism and social norms are important for reducing the economic cost of the pandemic. (C) 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
153,G,"Objectives: The impact of COVID-19 upon acute care admission rates and patterns are unknown. We sought to determine the change in rates and types of admissions to tertiary and specialty care hospitals in the COVID-19 era compared with pre-COVID-19 era. Methods: Acute care admissions to the largest tertiary care referral hospital, designated national referral centers for cardiac, cancer and maternity hospital in the State of Qatar during March 2020 (COVID-19 era) and January 2020 and March 2019 (pre-COVID-19 era) were compared. We calculated total admissions, admissions for eight specific acute care conditions, in-hospital mortality rate, and length of stay at each hospital. Results: A total of 18,889 hospital admissions were recorded. A sharp decline ranging from 9% to 75% was observed in overall admissions. A decline in both elective and non-elective surgeries was observed. A decline of 9%-58% was observed in admissions for acute appendicitis, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, bone fractures, cancer, and live births, whereas an increase in admissions due to respiratory tract infections was observed. Overall length of stay was shorter in the COVID-19 period possibly suggesting lesser overall disease severity, with no significant change in in-hospital mortality. Unadjusted mortality rate for Qatar showed marginal increase in the COVID-19 period. Conclusions: We observed a sharp decline in acute care hospital admissions, with a significant decline in admissions due to seven out of eight acute care conditions. This decline was associated with a shorter length of stay but not associated with a change in in-hospital mortality rate. (C) 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

154,G,"Objectives: The aim of the study was to understand the role of household variables on the percentage of physical activity (%PA) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) confinement in Portugal. Study design: A cross-sectional study design using an anonymous online survey was launched to assess how Portuguese families with children aged younger than 13 years adjusted their daily routines to the confinement. Methods: Separate analyses of variance were performed to investigate how factors such as the number of children, age, sex, the housing characteristics, and the adults' job situation can affect the percentage of time for PA (%PA). Results: Findings, based on data from 2159 children, indicate that (1) boys and girls did not differ in the %PA on any of the age-groups; (2) children with an outdoor space and who had other children in the household were significantly more active (P < .001); (3) children from families with all adults working from home showed lower levels of %PA; and (4) being younger, having a big outdoor space, having other children in the household, and having at least one adult free from working from home were significant positive predictors of children's %PA, explaining 21% of the overall variance. Conclusion: Time allocated for PA during this period is reduced compared with what is usually reported on normal days. It is necessary to find strategies to increase children's PA, especially in families in which both parents are working and have no outdoor space. (C) 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health.

155,G,"Objectives: To evaluate geographic access to free weekly outdoor physical activity events ('parkrun') in England, with a particular focus on deprived communities, and to identify optimal locations for future events to further maximise access. Study design: This study is a cross-sectional ecological analysis of the socio-economic disparities in geographic access to parkrun events in England in late 2018. Methods: We combined geolocation data on all English Lower Layer Super Output Areas and parkrun events to calculate geodesic distances to the nearest event for more than 32,000 communities in England. We use this measure of geographic access to summarise the relationship between access and socio-economic deprivation, measured using the index of multiple deprivation. We then used geographic coordinates of public green spaces in England to conduct a simple location-allocation analysis to identify 200 locations for future event locations that would maximise access. Results: In England, 69% of the population live within 5 km of one of the 465 parkrun events. There is a small negative correlation between distance and deprivation, indicating that access is slightly better in more socio-economically deprived areas. Setting up an additional 200 events in optimal locations would improve access: the average distance to the nearest parkrun event would improve by 1.22 km, from 4.65 km to 3.43 km, and approximately 82% of the English population would live within 5 km of a parkrun event. Conclusion: Over two-thirds of the English population live within 5 km of a parkrun event, and contrary to our expectation, we find that geographic access is slightly better for those living in more deprived communities. Creating additional events may improve geographic access, but effective strategies will still be needed to increase engagement in new and existing events by those living in socio-economically deprived areas.

156,G,"Objectives: Contact tracing and quarantine are common measures used in the management of infectious disease outbreaks. However, few studies have measured their impact on the control of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of those measures on reducing transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in a community setting. Study design: The study design is a retrospective cohort study. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of COVID-19 cases notified in Eastern Porto from March 1st to April 30th, 2020 was performed. Intervention and control cohorts were defined based on whether cases were subjected to contact tracing and quarantine measures before the laboratory confirmation of disease. The number of secondary cases per index case and the proportion of cases with subsequent secondary cases were the primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes included the time from symptom onset to specimen collection and the number of close contacts. The analysis was stratified according to whether national lockdown measures had already been implemented. Results: The intervention and control cohorts comprised 98 and 453 cases, respectively. No differences were observed concerning primary outcomes. The intervention group had a shorter time between symptom onset and specimen collection (median: 3 days, interquartile range [IQR]: 1-6, vs. median: 5 days, IQR: 2-7, P-value = 0.004) and fewer close contacts (median: 0, IQR: 0-2, vs. median: 2, IQR: 1-4, P-value<0.001). The stratified analysis returned similar results. Conclusion: Local public health measures were effective in reducing the time between symptom onset and laboratory diagnosis and the number of close contacts per case. No effect was apparent on secondary case figures, suggesting that further measures may be required. (C) 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
157,G,"Objectives: Technostress is an emergent phenomenon related to the pervasive use of technology and is associated with the increased computerisation and digitalisation seen over recent decades. This cross-sectional observational study aims to investigate the impact that stress from the use of technologies (i.e. technostress) has on the productivity and life of an individual. Study design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: Data were collected using a previously proposed and validated questionnaire. The questionnaire was translated into Italian and transformed into an online format with a Google Docs form. The questionnaire was then associated with a link and QR code (also available in paper format) and disseminated manually and through the use of e-mail and social networks, such as Facebook and Twitter. Results: The study sample included 313 individuals, 54.6% of whom were women. The mean age of the sample participants was 34.7 years. The dependent variables were technstressors (i.e. techno-overload, techno-invasion, techno-complexity, techno-insecurity and techno-uncertainty), role stressors (i.e. role overload and role conflict) and productivity. In the multivariate analysis, techno-overload was significantly associated with female gender (beta = 0.128; P = 0.018) and unemployment (beta = -0.303; P < 0.001); techno-invasion was significantly associated with female gender (beta = 0.098; P = 0.081) and degree-level education (beta = 0.149; P = 0.008); techno-complexity was significantly associated with female gender (beta = 0.107; P = 0.057) and being married (beta = 0.113; P = 0.046); techno-uncertainty was significantly associated with unemployment (beta= 0.337; P < 0.001); role overload was significantly associated with female gender (beta = 0.160; P = 0.014) and productivity was significantly associated with degree-level education (beta = 0.125; P = 0.057). Conclusions: This observational study evaluated the phenomenon of both work-related and non-workrelated technostress of 313 individuals aged between 16 and 65 years. The present study investigated the impact of five techno-stressors, two role stressors and productivity. The results indicate that different techno-stressors are significantly associated with female gender, degree-level education and unemployment. Further research in this field is required to better understand and clarify the epidemiology, clinical presentation and determinants of technostress. (C) 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health.

158,G,"Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the association of chronic diseases and indigenous ethnicity on the poor prognosis of outpatients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and hospitalised patients in Mexico. Study design: The study design is an observational study of consecutive COVID-19 cases that were treated in Mexican healthcare units and hospitals between February 27 and April 27, 2020. Methods: Epidemiological, clinical and sociodemographic data were analysed from outpatients and hospitalised patients. Cox regression models were used to analyse the risk of mortality after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Results: In total, 15,529 patients with COVID-19 were characterised; 62.6% of patients were aged older than 40 years, 57.8% were men and 1.4% were of indigenous ethnicity. A high proportion had a history of diabetes (18.4%), hypertension (21.9%) and obesity (20.9%). Among hospitalised patients, 11.2% received health care in the intensive care unit. Advanced age, male sex, indigenous ethnicity and having a history of chronic diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity, were significantly associated with a high risk of death after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Diabetes and obesity were the comorbidities most highly associated with death through the models used in this study. Moreover, living in Mexico City and Mexico State (where there is easy access to medical services) and walking (rather than driving or getting public transport) were negatively associated with mortality after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions: Diabetes, hypertension and obesity combined with older age, male sex and indigenous ethnicity increase the risk of death after SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Mexican population. It is recommended that the incidence of COVID-19 is monitored in indigenous communities, and access to health services is increased nationwide. (C) 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health.

159,G,"Objectives: Gun violence is a pressing concern in the United States, where many laws targeting gun violence vary across states and localities. Studies have investigated the association between gun laws and gun violence, but not many focus on the role of time, which is critical for implementation. This study aims to determine the lagged association of gun laws with firearm homicide mortality to better understand the impacts of state gun laws over time. Study design: The design of this study is a longitudinal study. Methods: This study applied the distributed lag non-linear model to assess the lagged association between firearm homicide mortality and the number of gun law provisions at the state level from 1999 to 2017. State gun law provisions were analyzed in aggregate and also across five groups of regulations. All estimates were transformed into relative risks (RRs). Results: Regarding all state gun laws, regardless of how many gun law provisions were on the books in any year, a significantly reduced RR of firearm homicide mortality was not observed until 7 years later. Among the five regulation groups, a significant RR less than 1 was more likely to happen in longer lags >= 5. The lowest significant RR = 0.24 (95% confidence interval = 0.15, 0.39) was observed in the gun types, components, and trafficking group at lag 8. All regulation groups had an overall impact to reduce significantly the RR of firearm homicide mortality with more gun law provisions, except for the dealer regulation group. Conclusions: State gun law provisions appear to impact firearm homicide mortality differently over time. This emphasizes the centrality of enforcement. Firearm policy researchers need to consider how specific gun laws are implemented over time to help inform law-based interventions. (C) 2020 The Authors.

160,G,"Objectives: The aim of the study was to examine COVID-19 preventive behaviours among individuals with mental health problems. Study design: This is a pooled cross-sectional study. Methods: Online survey data were analysed from 2000 Japanese adults collected in April and May 2020. Information was obtained on 13 COVID-19 preventive behaviours and anxiety and depressive symptoms using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale and Patient Health Questionnaire-9, respectively. Linear regression analysis was used to examine the associations. Results: In models adjusted for demographic and socio-economic factors, anxiety (coefficient: -0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.30, -0.24) and depressive symptoms (coefficient: -0.82, 95% CI: -1.34, -0.30) were both associated with significantly lower engagement in COVID-19 preventive behaviours.

161,G,"Objectives: The objective of this study was to investigate the potential health risks associated with Halloween festivities. Study design: This was a retrospective, population health study using insurance claims data between 2003-2014 representing more than 150 million unique Americans. Methods: We analyzed the entire spectrum of external cause of injuries and quantified the relative risk associated with Halloween celebrations by comparing the observed diagnosis rate during Halloween week with its statistical expectation. We further used the closest federal holiday in October, Columbus Day, as a comparison to further corroborate the effects of Halloween. Results: Our results indicate that no significant difference in relative risk for most conditions, like vehicle accidents, accidental poisoning and drowning, and adverse drug effects, during the Halloween season, when compared to the statistical expectation. However, we noticed a significant increase in the relative risk of accidental fall, self-inflicted injury, and injury inflicted by others, notably among young males. Conclusion: Halloween is an exciting time of year for kids, families, and the entire community. A more vigilant approach toward celebration, including attempts to prevent fights and brawls, would help everyone have a safe and harmonious Halloween. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

162,G,"Objective: The objective of the study was to develop the Barriers to Physical Activity and Sport Questionnaire for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer/questioning (BPASQ-LGBTQ+ [encompassing all spectrums of sexuality and gender]) persons (LGBT), which measures barriers using a socio-ecological model, and to validate it through exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Study design: Validation study. Methods: First, content validity was achieved by (a) developing a bank of items, (b) discussing the adequacy of the items in a committee of experts and classifying the selected ones under three socioecological levels (intrapersonal, interpersonal, environmental) and (c) refining wording and relevance of the items after a pilot test. Second, 709 LGBTQ+ persons completed the questionnaire online to establish construct validity, criterion validity and internal consistency. Results: Exploratory factor analysis revealed four underlying factors in the BPASQ-LGBTQ+, thus suggesting that the items initially considered as 'environmental barriers' could be constituting two separate factors based on social interactions or organizational aspects. Competing three- and four-factor models were tested using confirmatory factor analysis. The four-factor structure with two different factors accounting for environmental barriers obtained better values in all fit indices. Cronbach's alpha ranged from 0.745 to 0.813. Participants engaging in regular physical activity and sports reported lower scores in all the barriers subscales than their counterparts. Conclusion: The BPASQ-LGBTQ+ is valid and reliable to measure barriers to physical activity and sports in LGBTQ+ people across the different socio-ecological levels. It could be especially useful for understanding the complex relationships between these barriers, which is of great relevance for the design and implementation of interventions addressed to encourage physically active lifestyles among LGBTQ+ people.

163,G,"Objectives: The objective of the study was to estimate associations between health locus of control (HLC) and mortality. Study design & methods: The public health survey in Scania 2008 was linked to the Swedish cause of death register. In this study of 10,757 men and 12,322 women aged 18-80 years, 421 men and 235 women died during the 5.3-year follow-up. Survival analyses were conducted. Results: Respondents with only some or no internal HLC had significantly higher hazard rate ratios (HRRs) compared with respondents with high HLC. For women, the HRRs of those with low HLC did not significantly differ from the reference group after final adjustments for health-related behaviours. Conclusions: HLC is a predictor of mortality, and this association is to an important extent mediated by health-related behaviours. (C) 2020 The Authors.

164,G,"Objectives: The aim of the study was to investigate differences in the frequency and types of engagement in sports before, during and after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) stay-at-home order in Tyrol, Austria. Study design: A representative population survey was conducted. Methods: A sample of Tyroleans (N = 511) was questioned by a market research institute via an online questionnaire or telephone survey. Results: During the stay-at-home order, participants engaged less in sports than before and after the restrictions. However, within-group analyses revealed increasing sport participation in less active groups when comparing the pre- and post-COVID-19 period. Conclusions: Despite the restrictions during the stay-at-home order, respondents did engage in sports and promoted their health. Nevertheless, it is still necessary to investigate the long-term effects of the COVID-19 crisis on sports and exercise behaviour as well as the extent to which sports policy measures may be able increase sports participation.

165,A,"Sibling aggression is common and often viewed as benign. Although sibling aggression can be harmful for the victims, it may also be a marker of clinical risk for the aggressor. We differentiated typical from atypical levels of perpetration of sibling-directed aggression among preschoolers, a developmental period in which aggression is a normative misbehavior, by (a) identifying how frequently aggressive behaviors targeted at a sibling must occur to be psychometrically atypical; (b) mapping the dimensional spectrum of sibling-directed aggression from typical, more commonly occurring behaviors to rarer, more atypical, actions; and (c) comparing the psychometric atypicality and typical-to-atypical spectrum of sibling-directed aggression and peer-directed aggression. Parents (N = 1,524) of 3- (39.2%), 4-(36.7%), and 5-(24.1%) year-olds (51.9% girls, 41.1% African-American, 31.9% Hispanic; 44.0% below the federal poverty line) completed the MAP-DB, which assesses how often children engage in aggressive behaviors. We used item-response theory (IRT) to address our objectives. Most aggressive behaviors toward siblings were psychometrically atypical when they occurred 'most days' or more; in contrast, most behaviors targeted at peers were atypical when they occurred 'some days' or more. With siblings, relational aggression was more atypical than verbal aggression, whereas with peers, both relational and physical aggression were more atypical than verbal aggression. In both relationships, the most typical behavior was a verbally aggressive action. were broadly replicated in a second, independent sample. These findings are a first step toward specifying features of sibling aggression that are markers of clinical risk and belie the notion that sibling aggression is inherently normative."
166,C,"Dense and narrow rings have been discovered recently around the small Centaur object Chariklo1 and the dwarf planet Haumea(2), while being suspected around the Centaur Chiron(3), although this point is debated(4). They are the first rings observed in the Solar System elsewhere than around giant planets. In contrast to giant planets, gravitational fields of small bodies may exhibit large non-axisymmetric terms that create strong resonances between the spin of the object and the mean motion of ring particles. Here we show that modest topographic features or elongations of Chariklo and Haumea explain why their rings are relatively far away from the central body, when scaled to those of the giant planets(5). Resonances actually clear on decadal timescales an initial collisional disk that straddles the corotation resonance (where the particles' mean motion matches the spin rate of the body). Quite generically, the disk material inside the corotation radius migrates onto the body, while the material outside the corotation radius is pushed outside the 1/2 resonance, where the particles complete one revolution while the body completes two rotations. Consequently, the existence of rings around non-axisymmetric bodies requires that the 1/2 resonance resides inside the Roche limit of the body, favouring faster rotators for being surrounded by rings."
167,A,"Genomic analysis of the child might offer new potential to illuminate human parenting. We examined whether offspring (G2) genome-wide genotype variation (SNPs) is associated with their mother's (G1) emotional warmth and intolerance, indicating a gene-environment correlation. If this association is stronger than between G2 ' s genes and their emotional warmth and intolerance toward their own children, then this would indicate the presence of an evocative gene-environment correlation. To further understand how G1 mother's parenting has been evoked by genetically influenced characteristics of the child (G2), we examined whether child (G2) temperament partially accounted for the association between offspring genes and parental responses. Participants were from the Young Finns Study. G1 mothers (N = 2,349; mean age 39 years) self-reported the emotional warmth and intolerance toward G2 in 1980 when the participants were from 3 to 18 years old. G2 participants answered the same parenting scales in 2007/2012 (N = 1,378; mean age = 38 years in 2007; 59% female) when their children were on average 11 years old. Offspring temperament traits were self-reported in 1992 (G2 age range 15-30 years). Estimation of the phenotypic variance explained by the SNPs of G2 was done by genome-wide complex trait analysis with restricted maximum likelihood (GCTA-GREML). showed that the SNPs of a child (G2) explained 22.6% of the phenotypic variance of maternal intolerance (G1; p-value = .039). G2 temperament trait negative emotionality explained only 2.4% points of this association. G2 genes did not explain G1 emotional warmth or G2 ' s own emotional warmth and intolerance. However, further analyses of a combined measure of both G1 parenting scales found genetic effects. Parent or child gender did not moderate the observed associations. Presented genome-wide evidence is pointing to the important role a child plays in affecting and shaping his/her family environment, though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear."

These actions follow Trump's May 2019 pardon of First Lieutenant Michael Behenna, who had been found guilty of murdering a detainee in Iraq. These intrusions into military proceedings were an unusual use of the president's pardon power and have raised concerns about the U.S. commitment to international humanitarian law."
169,B,"This Article argues that investment treaties subtly constrain how nations organize their internal systems of private law, including laws of property, contracts, corporations, and intellectual property. Problematically, the treaties do so on a one-size-fits-all basis, disregarding the wide variation in values reflected in these domestic legal institutions. Investor-state dispute settlement exacerbates this tension, further distorting national private law arrangements. This hidden aspect of the system produces inefficiency, unfairness, and distributional inequities that have eluded the regime's critics and apologists alike."
170,A,"Reading disorder (RD) and mathematics disorder (MD) frequently co-occur. However, the exact comorbidity rates differ largely between studies. Given that MD is characterised by high heterogeneity on the symptom level, differences in comorbidity rates may result from different mathematical subskills used to define MD. Comorbidity rates with RD are likely to be higher when MD is measured by mathematical subskills that do not only build on number processing, but also require language (i.e. arithmetic fluency), than when measured by magnitude processing skills. The association between literacy, arithmetic fluency and magnitude processing as well as the overlap between deficits in these domains were assessed in a representative sample of 1,454 third Graders. Associations were significantly higher between literacy and arithmetic, than between literacy and magnitude processing. This was also reflected in comorbidity rates: comorbidity rates between literacy and arithmetic deficits were four times higher than expected by chance, whereas comorbidity rates between literacy and magnitude processing deficits did not exceed chance rate. Deficits in the two mathematical subskills showed some overlap, but also revealed dissociations, corroborating the high heterogeneity of MD. are interpreted within a multiple-deficit framework and implications for diagnosis and intervention are discussed. The overlap between RD and MD depends on the subskills used to define MD. Due to shared domain-general factors mathematical subskills that draw on language skills are more strongly associated with literacy than those that do not require language. The findings further indicate that the same symptom, such as deficits in arithmetic, can be associated with different cognitive deficits, a deficit in language skills or a deficit in number processing."
171,C,"For a comprehensive understanding of planetary formation and evolution, we need to investigate the environment in which planets form: circumstellar disks. Here we present high-contrast imaging observations of V4046 Sagittarii, a 20-Myr-old close binary known to host a circumbinary disk. We have discovered the presence of rotating shadows in the disk, caused by mutual occultations of the central binary. Shadow-like features are often observed in disks(1,2), but those found thus far have not been due to eclipsing phenomena. We have used the phase difference due to light travel time to measure the flaring of the disk and the geometrical distance of the system. We calculate a distance that is in very good agreement with the value obtained from the Gaia mission's Data Release 2 (DR2), and flaring angles of alpha = (6.2 +/- 0.6)degrees and alpha = (8.5 +/- 1.0)degrees for the inner and outer disk rings, respectively. Our technique opens up a path to explore other binary systems, providing an independent estimate of distance and the flaring angle, a crucial parameter for disk modelling."
172,A,"Self-harm is common and there is a need for studies that investigate the relevance of this behavior in clinical samples to inform risk assessment and treatment. The objectives in the current studies were to compare clinical and psychosocial correlates and subsequent adverse outcomes in youth who present to child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) with self-harm only (SH), self-harm with suicidality (SH+SU), with those without any indication of SH or SH+SU. We conducted a case-control study and a longitudinal cohort study using data from a regional clinical care register, and Swedish national registers. The case-control study included all patients (5-17 years) between 2011 and 2015 (N = 25,161). SH and SH+SU cases were compared with controls (patients without SH) regarding a range of correlates. The longitudinal study included former CAMHS patients (N = 6,120) who were followed for a median time of 2.8 years after termination of CAMHS contact regarding outcomes such as clinical care consumption, social welfare recipiency, and crime conviction. In the case-control study, both the SH and SH+SU groups received more clinical care, had lower global functioning, and higher odds of having mental disorders compared to controls. In most comparisons, the SH+SU group had more problems than the SH group. In the longitudinal study, the same pattern emerged for most outcomes; for example, the adjusted hazard ratio for recurrent care due to self-harm was 23.1 (95% confidence interval [CI], 17.0-31.4) in the SH+SU group compared to 3.9 (95% CI, 2.3-6.7) in the SH group. Adolescent patients presenting with self-harm have higher risks for adverse outcomes than patients without self-harm. Suicidality in addition to self-harm is associated with more severe outcomes, importantly recurrent episodes of care for self-harm."
173,A,"Introduction Development and behaviour in Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS), including autism characteristics, have been described infrequently stratified to genetic cause and only a few studies have considered behavioural characteristics in relation to developmental level. Here, we describe the behavioural phenotype in individuals with CdLS with SMC1A variants. We performed an international, interdisciplinary study on 51 individuals with SMC1A variants. of questionnaire studies are compared to those in individuals with Down Syndrome and with Autism Spectrum Disorder. on cognition and self-injurious behaviour (SIB) are compared to those in individuals with CdLS caused by NIPBL variants. For Dutch participants with SMC1A variants we performed direct in-person assessments of cognition, autism, and added an interview and questionnaire on adaptive behaviour and sensory processing. Individuals with SMC1A variants show a higher cognitive level and less SIB than individuals with NIPBL variants. Individuals with SMC1A variants without classic CdLS phenotype but with a Rett-like phenotype show more severe intellectual disability and more SIB compared to those with a CdLS phenotype. Autism is less present if outcomes in direct in-person assessments are evaluated taking developmental level into account compared to results based on a questionnaire. Behaviour in individuals with CdLS should be evaluated taking genetic cause into account. Detailed interdisciplinary approaches are of clinical importance to inform tailored care and may eventually improve quality of life of patients and families."
174,A,"Suicide is the second leading cause of death in young people. Childhood maltreatment, neuropsychological dysfunction and psychopathology have each been shown to increase risk for suicidal behavior. However, few studies have examined their interactions and the effects of those interactions on suicidal behavior. Across two sites, a total of 382 offspring of depressed parents underwent neuropsychological assessments. This high-risk sample included nearly equal numbers of males and females. Average age at the time of neuropsychological assessment was 18.5 years. The most prevalent lifetime psychiatric disorders were mood (43%), anxiety (37%) and alcohol and substance use disorders (21%). Childhood maltreatment was reported by 44% of offspring. Participants underwent extensive neuropsychological testing assessing the following domains: attention, memory, executive function, working memory, language fluency, and impulse control. Logistic regression was used to examine the association of reported childhood maltreatment, neuropsychological functioning, psychopathology and their interactions with suicidal behavior. Bonferroni correction was used to adjust for multiple comparisons. Maltreatment was associated with increased risk of suicidal behavior with odds ratios ranging between 2.40 and 4.43. Moderation analyses found that adaptive neuropsychological functioning was not protective against childhood maltreatment's effect on suicidal risk. While lifetime history of mood disorder was strongly associated with suicidal behavior, higher scores in working memory (OR = 0.21; 95% CI = 0.09, 0.45; p < .001) and executive function (OR = 0.15; 95% CI = 0.05, 0.43; p < .001) were protective against suicidal behavior even in the presence of a lifetime history of mood disorder. Further research is needed to determine how neuropsychological capacity protects depressed patients against the risk of suicidal behavior."
175,A,"Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is highly prevalent among adolescent and emerging adult females. Most studies examining the relationship between stress and NSSI largely have relied on aggregate self-report measures of stress and between-person models. Using data from two prospective samples, this manuscript tests the hypothesis that within-person models of NSSI provide better clinical markers of risk for NSSI than between-person models of NSSI. Two samples (Sample 1: 220 high-risk girls, M age = 14.68, SD = 1.36, baseline assessment and 3-month follow-ups for 18 months; Sample 2: 40 emerging adult females with a history of NSSI, M age = 21.55, SD = 2.14, 14 days with daily retrospective reports) were followed prospectively and completed validated measures of stress and NSSI. Models were adjusted for age and depression. In Sample 1, a within-person model demonstrated that higher-than-usual (but not average) stress levels predicted NSSI within the same 3-month wave. In Sample 2, results from a within-person model with daily diary assessment data showed that higher-than-usual stress (but not average daily stress) predicted same-day NSSI. Together, our results suggest that higher-than-usual stress, relative to one's typical stress level, but not average stress levels, signals times of enhanced risk for NSSI. These results highlight the clinical utility of repeated assessments of stress."
176,A,"Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) such as physical and emotional abuse are strongly associated with self-harm, but mechanisms underlying this relationship are unclear. Inflammation has been linked to both the experience of ACEs and self-harm or suicide in prior research. This is the first study to examine whether inflammatory markers mediate the association between exposure to ACEs and self-harm. Participants were 4,308 young people from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a population-based birth cohort in the United Kingdom. A structural equation modelling approach was used to fit a mediation model with the number of ACEs experienced between ages 0 and 9 years old (yo), levels of the inflammatory markers interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein measured at 9.5 yo, and self-harm reported at 16 yo. The mean number of ACEs young people experienced was 1.41 (SE 0.03). Higher ACE scores were associated with an increased risk of self-harm at 16 yo (direct effect relative risk (RR) per additional ACE 1.11, 95% CI 1.05, 1.18, p < 0.001). We did not find evidence of an indirect effect of ACEs on self-harm via inflammation (RR 1.00, 95% CI 1.00, 1.01, p = 0.38). Young people who have been exposed to ACEs are a group at high risk of self-harm. The association between ACEs and self-harm does not appear to be mediated by an inflammatory process in childhood, as indexed by peripheral levels of circulating inflammatory markers measured in childhood. Further research is needed to identify alternative psychological and biological mechanisms underlying this relationship."
177,C,"The exact nature of the arms of spiral galaxies is still an open question(1). It has been widely assumed that spiral arms in galaxies with two distinct symmetrical arms are the products of density waves that propagate around the disk, with the spiral arms being visibly enhanced by the star formation that is triggered as the passing wave compresses gas in the galaxy disk(1-3). Such a persistent wave would propagate with an approximately constant angular speed, its pattern speed OP. The quasi-stationary density wave theory can be tested by measuring this quantity and showing that it does not vary with radius in the galaxy. Unfortunately, this measurement is difficult because Omega(P) is only indirectly connected to observables such as the stellar rotation speed(4-6). Here, we use the detailed information on stellar populations of the grand-design spiral galaxy UGC 3825, extracted from spectral mapping, to measure the offset between young stars of a known age and the spiral arm in which they formed, allowing a direct measurement of Omega(P) at a range of radii. The offset in this galaxy is found to be as expected for a pattern speed that varies little with radius, indicating consistency with a quasi-stationary density wave, and lending credence to this new method."
178,A,"Predictions of two different models for suicide attempts (SA) over 12 months, as differentially impacted by specific school-based suicide prevention interventions, were compared. These were as follows: (a) interpersonal theory (IPTS) and (b) a two-pathway model, one path associated with externalizing symptoms and continuum of self-harm behaviors, and the other with internalizing symptoms. Self-report questionnaires were completed by 11,110 high school students from ten EU countries enrolled in the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) study. Baseline measures included perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness from parents and peers, health risk behaviors, self-injury, suicide ideation (SI), and attempts (SA). SI and SA were reassessed at 12-month follow-up. Each model's predictions of SI and SA groups over time (i.e., repeated SA, remitted SA, SA onset, and no SA) were estimated in the no intervention/control group. The superior model was estimated across intervention groups. Interpersonal theory showed better fit compared to the two-pathway model. In partial agreement with IPTS predictions, parental low belongingness but not peer belongingness or burdensomeness predicted greater likelihood of SI. The likelihood of repeated SA versus no SA was higher among adolescents who reported SI, self-injury, risk behaviors, and particularly both SI and self-injury. All three interventions attenuated the combined effect of SI and self-injury. Youth Aware of Mental Health Program (YAM) additionally decreased the effect of risk behaviors on the likelihood of repeated SA. Interpersonal theory assumptions were partially supported. Perceived interpersonal difficulties with parents were primarily related with SI, and risk behaviors and self-injury were important predictors of SA. Suicide prevention interventions may be effective by mitigating the hazardous effect of varying self-harm behaviors and may be further advanced by increasing parental involvement."
179,A,"Although a robust body of literature implicates temperamental behavioral inhibition (BI) as a prominent risk factor for anxiety disorders, many children with heightened BI do not develop anxiety. The current study examines the role of two forms of life stress (life events and natural disaster exposure) in moderating the relationship between BI in preschoolers and anxiety in early adolescence. Method A community sample of 392 3-year-old children was administered a laboratory observational assessment of temperament. When children were a mean age 10, the region was struck by a devastating hurricane and exposure to disaster-related stress was assessed. In early adolescence, youth and a parent were administered the UCLA Life Stress Interview (LSI) to assess behaviorally independent and dependent negative life events during the prior year and youth completed the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED). The association between early childhood BI and anxiety symptoms in early adolescence was moderated by both independent life events and disaster-related stress. Children high in BI at age 3 reported greater anxiety symptoms at age 12 after exposure to higher levels of both forms of stress. Stress moderated the association between early BI and later anxiety. Importantly, this was evident for two different kinds of stressors that were independent of the child's behavior that increases confidence in the causal role of stress in the development of anxiety in high BI children."
180,A,"Parenting programs suitable for delivery at scale in low-resource contexts are urgently needed. We conducted a randomized trial of Parenting for Lifelong Health (PLH) for Young Children, a low-cost 12-session program designed to increase positive parenting and reduce harsh parenting and conduct problems in children aged 2-9. Two hundred and ninety-six caregivers, whose children showed clinical levels of conduct problems (Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory Problem Score, >15), were randomly assigned using a 1:1 ratio to intervention or control groups. At t(0), and at 4-5 months (t(1)) and 17 months (t(2)) after randomization, research assistants blind to group assignment assessed (through caregiver self-report and structured observation) 11 primary outcomes: positive parenting, harsh parenting, and child behavior; four secondary outcomes: parenting stress, caregiver depression, poor monitoring/supervision, and social support. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02165371); Pan African Clinical Trial Registry (PACTR201402000755243); Violence Prevention Trials Register (). Caregivers attended on average 8.4 sessions. After adjustment for 30 comparisons, strongest results were as follows: at t(1), frequency of self-reported positive parenting strategies (10% higher in the intervention group, p = .003), observed positive parenting (39% higher in the intervention group, p = .003), and observed positive child behavior (11% higher in the intervention group, p = .003); at t(2,) both observed positive parenting and observed positive child behavior were higher in the intervention group (24%, p = .003; and 17%, p = .003, respectively). with p-values t(1), the intervention group self-reported 11% fewer child problem behaviors, 20% fewer problems with implementing positive parenting strategies, and less physical and psychological discipline (28% and 14% less, respectively). There were indications that caregivers reported 20% less depression but 7% more parenting stress at t(1). Group differences were nonsignificant for observed negative child behavior, and caregiver-reported child behavior, poor monitoring or supervision, and caregiver social support. PLH for Young Children shows promise for increasing positive parenting and reducing harsh parenting."
181,A,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a potentially chronic and disabling disorder that affects a significant minority of youth exposed to trauma. Previous studies have concluded that trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TF-CBT) is an effective treatment for PTSD in youth, but the relative strengths of different psychological therapies are poorly understood. We undertook a systematic review and network meta-analyses of psychological and psychosocial interventions for children and young people with PTSD. Outcomes included PTSD symptom change scores post-treatment and at 1-4-month follow-up, and remission post-treatment. We included 32 trials of 17 interventions and 2,260 participants. Overall, the evidence was of moderate-to-low quality. No inconsistency was detected between direct and indirect evidence. Individual forms of TF-CBT showed consistently large effects in reducing PTSD symptoms post-treatment compared with waitlist. The order of interventions by descending magnitude of effect versus waitlist was as follows: cognitive therapy for PTSD (SMD -2.94, 95%CrI -3.94 to -1.95), combined somatic/cognitive therapies, child-parent psychotherapy, combined TF-CBT/parent training, meditation, narrative exposure, exposure/prolonged exposure, play therapy, Cohen TF-CBT/cognitive processing therapy (CPT), eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR), parent training, group TF-CBT, supportive counselling and family therapy (SMD -0.37, 95%CrI -1.60 to 0.84). for parent training, supportive counselling and family therapy were inconclusive. Cohen TF-CBT/CPT, group TF-CBT and supportive counselling had the largest evidence base. regarding changes in PTSD symptoms at follow-up and remission post-treatment were uncertain due to limited evidence. Trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy, in particular individual forms, appears to be most effective in the management of PTSD in youth. EMDR is effective but to a lesser extent. Supportive counselling does not appear to be effective. suggest a large positive effect for emotional freedom technique, child-parent psychotherapy, combined TF-CBT/parent training, and meditation, but further research is needed to confirm these findings as they were based on very limited evidence."
182,A,"Objective Childhood-onset depression is associated with increased risk of recurrent depression and high morbidity extending into adolescence and adulthood. This multisite randomized controlled trial evaluated two active psychosocial treatments for childhood depression: family-focused treatment for childhood depression (FFT-CD) and individual supportive psychotherapy (IP). Aims were to describe effects through 52 weeks postrandomization on measures of depression, functioning, nondepressive symptoms, and harm events. Children meeting criteria for depressive disorders (N = 134) were randomly assigned to 15 sessions of FFT-CD or IP and evaluated at mid-treatment for depressive symptoms and fully at roughly 16 weeks (after acute treatment), 32 weeks, and 52 weeks/one year. See clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01159041. Analyses using generalized linear mixed models confirmed the previously reported FFT-CD advantage on rates of acute depression response (>= 50% Children's Depression Rating Scale reduction). Improvements in depression and other outcomes were most rapid during the acute treatment period, and leveled off between weeks 16 and 52, with a corresponding attenuation of observed group differences, although both groups showed improved depression and functioning over 52 weeks. Survival analyses indicated that most children recovered from their index depressive episodes by week 52: estimated 76% FFT-CD, 77% IP. However, by the week 52 assessment, one FFT-CD child and six IP children had suffered recurrent depressive episodes. Four children attempted suicide, all in the IP group. Other indicators of possible harm were relatively evenly distributed across groups. indicate a quicker depression response in FFT-CD and hint at greater protection from recurrence and suicide attempts. However, outcomes were similar for both active treatments by week 52/one year. Although community care received after acute treatment may have influenced results, findings suggest the value of a more extended/chronic disease model that includes monitoring and guidance regarding optimal interventions when signs of depression-risk emerge."
183,A,"Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have a high risk for substance use disorders (SUDs). Early identification of at-risk youth would help allocate scarce resources for prevention programs. Psychiatric and somatic diagnoses, family history of these disorders, measures of socioeconomic distress, and information about birth complications were obtained from the national registers in Sweden for 19,787 children with ADHD born between 1989 and 1993. We trained (a) a cross-sectional random forest (RF) model using data available by age 17 to predict SUD diagnosis between ages 18 and 19; and (b) a longitudinal recurrent neural network (RNN) model with the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to predict new diagnoses at each age. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.73(95%CI 0.70-0.76) for the random forest model (RF). Removing prior diagnosis from the predictors, the RF model was still able to achieve significant AUCs when predicting all SUD diagnoses (0.69, 95%CI 0.66-0.72) or new diagnoses (0.67, 95%CI: 0.64, 0.71) during age 18-19. For the model predicting new diagnoses, model calibration was good with a low Brier score of 0.086. Longitudinal LSTM model was able to predict later SUD risks at as early as 2 years age, 10 years before the earliest diagnosis. The average AUC from longitudinal models predicting new diagnoses 1, 2, 5 and 10 years in the future was 0.63. Population registry data can be used to predict at-risk comorbid SUDs in individuals with ADHD. Such predictions can be made many years prior to age of the onset, and their SUD risks can be monitored using longitudinal models over years during child development. Nevertheless, more work is needed to create prediction models based on electronic health records or linked population registers that are sufficiently accurate for use in the clinic."
184,A,"The 11th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) made a number of significant changes to the diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We sought to determine the prevalence and 3-month predictive values of the new ICD-11 PTSD criteria relative to ICD-10 PTSD, in children and adolescents following a single traumatic event. ICD-11 also introduced a diagnosis of Complex PTSD (CPTSD), proposed to typically result from prolonged, chronic exposure to traumatic experiences, although the CPTSD diagnostic criteria do not require a repeated experience of trauma. We therefore explored whether children and adolescents demonstrate ICD-11 CPTSD features following exposure to a single-incident trauma. Method Data were analysed from a prospective cohort study of youth aged 8-17 years who had attended an emergency department following a single trauma. Assessments of PTSD, CPTSD, depressive and anxiety symptoms were performed at two to four weeks (n = 226) and nine weeks (n = 208) post-trauma, allowing us to calculate and compare the prevalence and predictive value of ICD-10 and ICD-11 PTSD criteria, along with CPTSD. Predictive abilities of different diagnostic thresholds were undertaken using positive/negative predictive values, sensitivity/specificity statistics and logistic regressions. At Week 9, 15 participants (7%) were identified as experiencing ICD-11 PTSD, compared to 23 (11%) experiencing ICD-10 PTSD. There was no significant difference in comorbidity rates between ICD-10 and ICD-11 PTSD diagnoses. Ninety per cent of participants with ICD-11 PTSD also met criteria for at least one CPTSD feature. Five participants met full CPTSD criteria. Reduced prevalence of PTSD associated with the use of ICD-11 criteria is likely to reduce identification of PTSD relative to using ICD-10 criteria but not relative to DSM-4 and DSM-5 criteria. Diagnosis of CPTSD is likely to be infrequent following single-incident trauma."
185,A,"There is emerging evidence of the potentially detrimental impact of social media on young people's mental health. Against this background, online self-harm content has been a recent focus of concern across academia, policy and the media. It has been argued to encourage or even cause acts such as self-cutting through mechanisms of contagion. However, little is known about why a young person might engage with such content or about its impact on behaviour or well-being. Online ethnographic observation of interactions around self-harm on Twitter, Reddit and Instagram: collection and analysis of 10,169 original posts and 36,934 comments, both written and pictorial, at two time-points in 2018 and 2019. Ten in-depth semi-structured interviews exploring engagements with self-harm content on social media. Our data show that peer support is the central component of online interactions around self-harm. Young people accessing such content are likely to already be self-harming; they may turn to social media to understand, and seek help for, their actions and feelings in a context of offline stigma and service support gaps. This paper engages with the mechanisms, complexities and impact of this peer-support, reflecting on the benefits and dangers to caring for oneself and others through social media. Self-harm content is a fraught issue at the centre of current debates around risks and opportunities for child and adolescent mental health in the digital age. Whilst the importance of supporting young people's online safety is clear, moves to eradicate self-harm content must be undertaken with caution so as not to cause unintentional harm. Our research highlights a need to think beyond a model of contagion, instead attending to other mechanisms of harm and benefit. In so doing, it challenges prevailing attitudes towards online communication about self-harm and accepted approaches to managing this."
186,A,"Delayed walking is common in intellectual disability (ID) but may be less common when ID occurs with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Previous studies examining this were limited by reliance on clinical samples and exclusion of children with severe motor deficits. Objective To examine in a population-based sample if age of walking is differentially related to intellectual ability in children with ASD versus other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). Participants were from the nested Autism Birth Cohort Study of the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). Cox proportional hazards regression assessed if diagnosis (ASD n = 212 vs. NDD n = 354), continuous nonverbal IQ, and their interaction, were associated with continuous age of walking. The relationship between nonverbal IQ and age of walking was stronger for NDD than for ASD (Group x nonverbal IQ interaction, chi(2) = 13.93, p = .0002). This interaction was characterized by a 21% decrease in the likelihood of walking onset at any given time during the observation period per 10-point decrease in nonverbal IQ (hazard ratio = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.78-0.85) in the NDD group compared to 8% (hazard ratio = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.86-0.98) in the ASD group. The finding that age of walking is less strongly related to low intellectual ability in children with ASD than in children without other NDDs supports the hypothesis that ID in ASD may result from heterogeneous developmental pathways. Late walking may be a useful stratification variable in etiological research focused on ASD and other NDDs."
187,E,"The process of settling in a new country can be extremely challenging, entailing various information needs to cope with rapid changes and adjustments to a new environment. Through interviews with 16 Korean immigrants in the United States, we explored their information behaviors in the settlement process. In line with prior work (Shoham & Strauss, 2008), we found that Korean immigrants needed various types of information: housing, work, banking, transportation, law, school, health, and language. Out of these information types, the Korean immigrants prioritized information for education and struggled to seek health and legal information. We further uncovered that various information needs are closely intertwined and found an additional type of information need: to build a new social network after migration. They often used Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) as information sources while adapting the ICT infrastructures of the U.S. into their information practices. ICTs enabled them to build and maintain """"local"""" and """"global"""" identity; however, they may struggle to assess user-generated content in the new context. We noted that their strong use of ICTs for intraethnic interaction might slow down their integration into the host society. We discuss implications for future work to support immigrants' settlement in the host country."
188,E,"In information retrieval evaluation, pooling is a well-known technique to extract a sample of documents to be assessed for relevance. Given the pooled documents, a number of studies have proposed different prioritization methods to adjudicate documents for judgment. These methods follow different strategies to reduce the assessment effort. However, there is no clear guidance on how many relevance judgments are required for creating a reliable test collection. In this article we investigate and further develop methods to determine when to stop making relevance judgments. We propose a highly diversified set of stopping methods and provide a comprehensive analysis of the usefulness of the resulting test collections. Some of the stopping methods introduced here combine innovative estimates of recall with time series models used in Financial Trading. Experimental results on several representative collections show that some stopping methods can reduce up to 95% of the assessment effort and still produce a robust test collection. We demonstrate that the reduced set of judgments can be reliably employed to compare search systems using disparate effectiveness metrics such as Average Precision, NDCG, P@100, and Rank Biased Precision. With all these measures, the correlations found between full pool rankings and reduced pool rankings is very high."
189,E,"y Conference publications in computer science (CS) have attracted scholarly attention due to their unique status as a main research outlet, unlike other science fields where journals are dominantly used for communicating research findings. One frequent research question has been how different conference and journal publications are, considering an article as a unit of analysis. This study takes an author-based approach to analyze the publishing patterns of 517,763 scholars who have ever published both in CS conferences and journals for the last 57 years, as recorded in DBLP. The analysis shows that the majority of CS scholars tend to make their scholarly debut, publish more articles, and collaborate with more coauthors in conferences than in journals. Importantly, conference articles seem to serve as a distinct channel of scholarly communication, not a mere preceding step to journal publications: coauthors and title words of authors across conferences and journals tend not to overlap much. This study corroborates findings of previous studies on this topic from a distinctive perspective and suggests that conference authorship in CS calls for more special attention from scholars and administrators outside CS who have focused on journal publications to mine authorship data and evaluate scholarly performance."
190,E,"This study is concerned with differences in referencing patterns between book literature and periodical publications. Four indicators, the mean reference rate per page, the percentage of references to Web of Science journal literature, the mean reference age, and Price Index, were applied to analyze the reference patterns of three publication types: books, book chapter articles and journal articles. References of publications indexed in Web of Science Core Collection were analyzed for two periods (2005-2009, 2010-2013) and across 15 disciplines. Journal article authors cite more recent references and more references from serial publications than monograph authors. The difference between the sciences and the SSH is as obvious as the difference between periodical and non-serial publications. However, the reference patterns of social sciences are much more similar to science fields than humanities, especially for monographs. The subject characteristics of reference pattern are strongly affected by publication types. Furthermore, journal publications have stronger associations between ageing indicators and the share of WoS journal references than monographs."
191,E,"The practice of correction and republication is a mechanism for identifying and updating non-maleficent yet message-distorting errors in the biomedical literature. Inappropriate use of anomalous literature is evinced by citation of invalidated scholarly works, and though it is known that republished versions of articles are cited more often than corrected versions, the strength of the effect of invalidation, correction, and republication has not been previously quantified. Robust analysis of 15,000+ citations to 548 articles indexed in PubMed indicates that the practice of correction and republication is a strong predictor of reduced post-republication citation relative to controls. This bibliometric analysis shows that corrected articles are cited on average 51% less than controls overall and that the practice of correction and republication results in a fast-acting and long-lasting reduction in citation of flawed works by downstream researchers."
192,E,"Publishing articles in high-impact English journals is difficult for scholars around the world, especially for non-native English-speaking scholars (NNESs), most of whom struggle with proficiency in English. To uncover the differences in English scientific writing between native English-speaking scholars (NESs) and NNESs, we collected a large-scale data set containing more than 150,000 full-text articles published in PLoS between 2006 and 2015. We divided these articles into three groups according to the ethnic backgrounds of the first and corresponding authors, obtained by Ethnea, and examined the scientific writing styles in English from a two-fold perspective of linguistic complexity: (a) syntactic complexity, including measurements of sentence length and sentence complexity; and (b) lexical complexity, including measurements of lexical diversity, lexical density, and lexical sophistication. The observations suggest marginal differences between groups in syntactical and lexical complexity."
193,E,"This article outlines a constructivist grounded theory (Charmaz, 2014) study of information poverty among a group of mothers of individuals with Down syndrome and/or Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) from a critical perspective, drawing on concepts from critical disability theory, critical race theory, and critical work within information and library science. The researchers gathered interview data from 24 mothers. Resulting data were inductively analyzed using Chatman's (1996) theory of information poverty. We propose information marginalization as a complimentary concept to describe the contextual conditions that contribute to a range of defensive information behaviors and suggest that assessment of these contextual conditions be a part of the system design process. This study has implications for the development and design of systems and service models intended to provide access to information and services for individuals with disability and contributes to a critical literature on information poverty."
194,E,"Social informatics researchers use a variety of techniques to explore the intersections between technology and society. Current interest has turned to making more explicit our commonly tacit knowledge processes that involve people and technology. Knowledge creation, sharing, and management processes are commonly hidden, and this is even more the case regarding ignorance processes such as the denial and obfuscation of knowledge. Understanding the construction, generation, and perpetuation of ignorance can: (i) provide insights into social phenomena that might otherwise seem inexplicable (for instance, persistence of """"urban myths""""), and (ii) enable development of interventions to either facilitate (as with privacy-sensitive material) or combat (as with malicious disinformation) ignorance. Although several pressing information issues relate to ignorance, agnotology (the study of ignorance) has only recently entered into the information science literature. An agnotologic approach expands the repertoire of methods and approaches in social informatics, better enabling the field to grapple with pressing contemporary issues of mis/dis/lack of information. Using Robert Proctor's typology of constructions of ignorance, this article describes ways that each type may be germane to and within social informatics, highlighting social informatics topics that would benefit from agnotologic exploration, and suggesting theoretical and methodological approaches useful to a social informatics of ignorance."
195,A,"Prior studies examining the sleep of adolescents with and without attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have relied on mean values such as average sleep duration, which masks intraindividual variability (IIV). The objective was to investigate whether adolescents with ADHD have greater IIV of sleep/wake patterns than adolescents without ADHD using actigraphy and daily sleep diaries. Method Adolescents (ages 13.17 +/- 0.40 years; 45% female) with (n = 162) and without (n = 140) ADHD were recruited from middle schools at two sites. Participants wore actigraphs and completed sleep diaries for an average of 2 weeks. Multilevel models were conducted with sex, sleep medication use, ADHD medication use, number of days with data, and social jetlag controlled for in analyses. For actigraphy, adolescents with ADHD had greater variability for time in bed, sleep onset and offset, and wake after sleep onset than adolescents without ADHD. For sleep diary data, adolescents with ADHD had greater variability in bedtime, wake time, sleep duration, sleep onset latency, sleep quality, and night wakings than adolescents without ADHD. Social jetlag was a significant predictor of variability in sleep measures based on both actigraph and daily diaries; however, ADHD status was not associated with social jetlag. This is the first study to show that adolescents with ADHD have more variable sleep/wake patterns than their peers using both objective and subjective sleep measures. IIV of sleep/wake patterns may be important for clinicians to assess and monitor as part of treatment. Research is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying increased IIV of sleep/wake patterns in adolescents with ADHD and potential consequences for daytime functioning."
196,A,"A central nosological problem concerns the etiological relationship of emotional dysregulation with ADHD. Molecular genetic risk scores provide a novel method for informing this question. Participants were 514 community-recruited children of Northern European descent age 7-11 defined as ADHD or non-ADHD by detailed research evaluation. Parents-rated ADHD on standardized ratings and child temperament on the Temperament in Middle Childhood Questionnaire (TMCQ) and reported on ADHD and comorbid disorders by semi-structured clinical interview. Categorical and dimensional variables were created for ADHD, emotional dysregulation (implicating disruption of regulation of both anger-irritability and of positive valence surgency-sensation seeking), and irritability alone (anger dysregulation). Genome-wide polygenic risk scores (PRS) were computed for ADHD and depression genetic liability. Structural equation models and computationally derived emotion profiles guided analysis. The ADHD PRS was associated in variable-centered analyses with irritability (beta = .179, 95% CI = 0.087-0.280; Delta R-2 = .034, p < .0002), but also with surgency/sensation seeking (B = .146, 95%CI = 0.052-0.240, Delta R-2=.022, p = .002). In person-centered analysis, the ADHD PRS was elevated in the emotion dysregulation ADHD group versus other ADHD children (OR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.03-2.20, Nagelkerke Delta R-2 = .013, p = .033) but did not differentiate irritable from surgent ADHD profiles. All effects were independent of variation in ADHD severity across traits or groups. The depression PRS was related to oppositional defiant disorder but not to ADHD emotion dysregulation. Irritability-anger and surgency-sensation seeking, as forms of negative and positively valenced dysregulated affect in ADHD populations, both relate principally to ADHD genetic risk and not mood-related genetic risk."
197,A,"Autonomic hyperarousal has been proposed as a dispositional risk factor for anxiety disorders (ADs). Therefore, we studied physiological arousal in offspring of fathers and mothers with and without ADs and whether infant hyperarousal predicts subsequent fearful temperament. Infants (N = 128; age = 4 months) did a novel stimuli task (exposure to visual, olfactory, and acoustic stimuli and an unfamiliar male) and a habituation task (exposure to a repeated acoustic stimulus). Heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) were measured during baseline, stimuli and post-stimuli rest. Parents' AD status and severity were measured using a diagnostic interview and their fearful temperament using a questionnaire. Child fearful temperament was measured at 4 months, 1 year and 2.5 years with observations during structured tasks. Parents' fearful temperament (significant in the habituation task), AD status (significant in the novel stimuli task) and AD severity (significant in both tasks) predicted a higher HR in their infants. Infants' higher HR reactivity to novel stimuli and diminished HR recovery at 4 months predicted a more fearful temperament during infancy and toddlerhood. Infants' higher HR at 4 months predicted a more fearful temperament at 2.5 years. Parental prenatal anxiety (disorders) predicted infants' autonomic arousal, which in turn predicted later fearful temperament in children. Outcomes suggest that autonomic hyperarousal is a dispositional risk factor of ADs."
198,A,"Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with emotional problems, and their co-occurrence often leads to worse outcomes. We investigated the developmental associations between ADHD and emotional problems from childhood to early adolescence and examined the genetic and environmental contributions to their developmental link. We further tested whether this developmental association remained across the transition to young adulthood. We used data from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, a cohort of 2,232 British twins. In childhood, ADHD and emotional problems were assessed at ages 5, 7, 10 and 12 with mothers' and teachers' reports. At age 18, we used self-reported symptoms according to DSM-5 criteria for ADHD, and DSM-IV for anxiety and depression. Longitudinal analyses showed that earlier ADHD was associated with later emotional problems consistently across childhood. However, earlier emotional problems were not associated with later ADHD symptoms. The developmental association between ADHD and later emotional problems in childhood was entirely explained by common genetic factors. Consistent with results in childhood, earlier symptoms of ADHD were associated with later emotional problems during the transition to young adulthood. Our findings demonstrate that ADHD symptoms are predictors of the development of emotional problems, from childhood up to young adulthood, through shared genetic influences. Interventions targeting ADHD symptoms might prevent the development of emotional problems. Clinicians treating youth with ADHD must be aware of their risk for developing emotional problems and ought to assess, monitor and treat emotional problems alongside ADHD symptoms from childhood to adulthood."
199,A,"Social anxiety is common in autistic adolescents. While emerging evidence indicates the importance of several mechanisms (including intolerance of uncertainty (IU), alexithymia and sensory processing) for maintaining anxiety, limited research has explored how these factors are associated with social anxiety in autistic adolescents. We investigated whether IU, emotional and sensory processing are related to social anxiety in autistic and neurotypical adolescents, gathering experimental and questionnaire data from 61 autistic and 62 neurotypical 11- to 17-year-olds recruited to have similarly high levels of anxiety. In autistic and neurotypical adolescents matched for social anxiety, similar significant associations were observed between social anxiety and IU, alexithymia, maladaptive emotion regulation, sensory hypersensitivity and interoceptive sensibility. Taking a dimensional approach, we found that child- and parent-reported IU, alexithymia and sensory hypersensitivity mediated the relationship between autistic traits and social anxiety symptoms in the combined group of adolescents. Our findings indicate that similar correlates of social anxiety are evident in autistic and neurotypical youths experiencing social anxiety and further our understanding of mechanisms that may contribute towards social anxiety in both groups."
200,A,"A better understanding of the trajectories and economic burden of psychiatric and somatic disorders (multimorbidity) in ADHD from childhood to adulthood is important for guiding more targeted areas for treatment of ADHD and prevention of multimorbidity, and for forecasting demands on the medical infrastructure. This study aimed to investigate patterns of healthcare utilization and costs of multimorbidity across young adulthood in individuals with a childhood ADHD diagnosis, and additionally in individuals who continue to have ADHD-related contact with health services (persisters) and those who do not (remitters). We prospectively followed a cohort (N = 445,790) born 1987-1990 from the ages of 18 to 26 years. Data on healthcare utilization were obtained from the Swedish National Patient Register (inpatient and outpatient care) and the Prescribed Drug Register (medication prescriptions). Mean annual costs per capita from multimorbidity was euro890 ($1,223) in individuals with a childhood ADHD diagnosis (persisters/remitters: euro1,060[$1,456]/euro609[$837]) and euro304 ($418) in individuals without. Costs were largely driven by inpatient hospital admissions, mainly from drug abuse and injuries. Healthcare utilization and costs of psychiatric and somatic disorders at 18 years was significantly higher in individuals with childhood ADHD compared to those without. These group differences remained stable or increased across young adulthood for most outcomes and were generally larger in women than in men. ADHD remitters continued to show significantly greater healthcare utilization and costs compared to individuals without childhood ADHD, although their profiles were not as severe as ADHD persisters. Childhood ADHD has long-term associations with both psychiatric and somatic disorders. Findings demonstrate the individual and societal burden of ADHD in adulthood and highlight the importance of continued support from childhood-adolescent to adult health services and early prevention of multimorbidity. Findings also point to specific targets for intervention that may be effective, such as drug abuse and injuries."
201,A,"Externalizing behavior has been attributed, in part, to decreased frontolimbic control over amygdala activation. However, little is known about developmental trajectories of frontoamygdalar functional connectivity and its relation to externalizing behavior. The present study addresses this gap by examining longitudinal associations between adolescent and adult externalizing behavior and amygdala-anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and amygdala-orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) resting-state functional connectivity in a sample of 111 typically developing participants aged 11-23 at baseline. Participants completed two-to-four data waves spaced approximately two years apart, resulting in a total of 309 data points. At each data wave, externalizing behavior was measured using the Externalizing Behavior Broadband Scale from the Achenbach Youth/Adult Self-Report questionnaire. Resting-state fMRI preprocessing was performed using FSL. Amygdala functional connectivity was examined using AFNI. The longitudinal association between externalizing behavior and amygdala-ACC/OFC functional connectivity was examined using linear mixed effect models in R. Externalizing behavior was associated with increased amygdala-ACC and amygdala-OFC resting-state functional connectivity across adolescence and young adulthood. For amygdala-ACC connectivity, externalizing behavior at baseline primarily drove this association, whereas for amygdala-OFC functional connectivity, change in externalizing behavior relative to baseline drove the main effect of externalizing behavior on amygdala-OFC functional connectivity. No evidence was found for differential developmental trajectories of frontoamygdalar connectivity for different levels of externalizing behavior (i.e., age-by-externalizing behavior interaction effect). Higher externalizing behavior is associated with increased resting-state attunement between the amygdala and ACC/OFC, perhaps indicating a generally more vigilant state for neural networks important for emotional processing and control."
202,B,"Scholars have argued that Senate-approved treaties are becoming increasingly irrelevant in the United States, because their role can be fulfilled by their close but less politically costly cousin, the congressional-executive agreement. This study demonstrates that treaties are more durable than congressional-executive agreements, supporting the view that there are qualitative differences between the two instruments. Abandoning the treaty may therefore lead to unintended consequences by decreasing the tools that the executive has available to design optimal agreements."
203,B,"In the MV """"Norstar"""" Case (Norstar Case), the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) produced two reasoned decisions. In the first, the Tribunal established jurisdiction over the relevant dispute and the admissibility of Panama's claims. In the second, it found that Italy had violated Panama's right to freedom of navigation on the high seas. In the latter decision, the Tribunal relied on an expansive understanding of flag state jurisdiction-prompting a vociferous joint dissent by seven of its twenty-three judges. The majority's understanding of the jurisdictional exclusivity of the flag state as extending to prescriptive as well as enforcement jurisdiction is a significant expansion of flag state rights-and will have a corresponding impact on the way that shipping is regulated internationally."
204,A,"Early-onset depression during childhood and adolescence is associated with a worse course of illness and outcome than adult onset. However, the genetic factors that influence risk for early-onset depression remain mostly unknown. Using data collected over 13 years, we examined whether polygenic risk scores (PRS) that capture genetic risk for depression were associated with depressive symptom trajectories assessed from childhood to adolescence. Data came from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a prospective, longitudinal birth cohort (analytic sample = 7,308 youth). We analyzed the relationship between genetic susceptibility to depression and three time-dependent measures of depressive symptoms trajectories spanning 4-16.5 years of age (class, onset, and cumulative burden). Trajectories were constructed using a growth mixture model with structured residuals. PRS were generated from the summary statistics of a genome-wide association study of depression risk using data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, UK Biobank, and 23andMe, Inc. We used MAGMA to identify gene-level associations with these measures. Youth were classified into six classes of depressive symptom trajectories: high/renitent (27.9% of youth), high/reversing (9.1%), childhood decrease (7.3%), late childhood peak (3.3%), adolescent spike (2.5%), and minimal symptoms (49.9%). PRS discriminated between youth in the late childhood peak, high/reversing, and high/renitent classes compared to the minimal symptoms and childhood decrease classes. No significant associations were detected at the gene level. This study highlights differences in polygenic loading for depressive symptoms across childhood and adolescence, particularly among youths with high symptoms in early adolescence, regardless of age-independent patterns."
205,A,"There is converging evidence that mental disorders are more optimally conceptualized in a hierarchical framework (i.e., the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology, HiTOP) that transcends the categorical boundaries of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). However, the majority of this evidence comes from studies that draw upon predominantly European American or Caucasian populations. Whether a hierarchical conceptualization of mental disorders generalizes across racial-ethnic groups, including for African American (AA) populations, is unclear. We tested multidimensional and bifactor models of 15 DSM diagnoses and psychiatric traits in two groups, including AA (n = 3,088) and European American (EA; n = 5,147) youths aged 8-21 from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). We also conducted multigroup confirmatory factor analyses to test for factorial invariance between the best fitting AA and EA multidimensional and bifactor models. In the multidimensional model tests, a three-factor model, specifying internalizing, externalizing, and thought dimensions, emerged as the best fitting model for AAs and EAs. In the bifactor model tests, a three-factor model (i.e., internalizing, externalizing, and thought dimensions) that also specified a general factor emerged as the optimal for both AAs and EAs. The general factor accounted for a significant proportion of the covariation between the secondary factors and the individual disorders and traits. Furthermore, both models were factorially invariant, indicating no significant difference in the factor structure of mental disorders between AAs and EAs in PNC. suggest that the hierarchical factor structure of mental disorders may be racial-ethnically robust. This finding has implications for etiological and epidemiological studies focused on racial-ethnic subgroup comparisons, particularly with respect to identifying similarities and differences in prevalence rates or sociodemographic risk factors for mental disorders."
206,A,"This study examined the genetic and environmental influences underlying baseline level and developmental course of callous-unemotional (CU) traits across childhood and adolescence. The data on 8,958 twin pairs (3,108 MZ twin pairs and 5,850 DZ twin pairs) from the Twins Early Development Study were analysed. CU traits were assessed at ages 7, 9, 12 and 16 by mothers and analysed using a biometric latent growth model. Individual differences in the baseline level of CU traits were highly heritable (76.5%), while the heritability of the developmental course of CU traits was moderate (43.6%). The genetic influences on baseline level and developmental course of CU traits were mostly nonoverlapping. Nonshared environment made a modest contribution to the baseline level of CU traits (21.7%). Nonshared environmental influences on the developmental course of CU traits were moderate (43.2%), with nearly half of them being the same as those influencing the baseline level and just over half being specific. Shared environmental effects did not contribute to systematic change across childhood and adolescence but were rather age-specific. Our findings demonstrate that rather than only being conceptualized as factors of stability, genes also play a dynamic role in explaining systematic change in CU traits. Genetic effects for the initial risk and subsequent development of CU traits are not the same. In addition to genetic factors, nonshared environmental influences play an important role in explaining why some children will increase or maintain their CU traits over time, whereas other will desist. New genetic and environmental influences with age suggest that repeated, age-tailored interventions may be required throughout development to make a lasting difference in the presentation of CU traits and associated outcomes."
207,A,"Prenatal development is a time when the brain is acutely vulnerable to insult and alteration by environmental factors (e.g., toxins, maternal health). One important risk factor is maternal obesity (Body Mass Index > 30). Recent research indicates that high maternal BMI during pregnancy is associated with increased risk for numerous physical health, cognitive, and mental health problems in offspring across the lifespan. It is possible that heightened maternal prenatal BMI influences the developing brain even before birth. The present study examines this possibility at the level of macrocircuitry in the human fetal brain. Using a data-driven strategy for parcellating the brain into subnetworks, we test whether MRI functional connectivity within or between fetal neural subnetworks varies with maternal prenatal BMI in 109 fetuses between the ages of 26 and 39weeks. We discovered that strength of connectivity between two subnetworks, left anterior insula/inferior frontal gyrus (aIN/IFG) and bilateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), varied with maternal BMI. At the level of individual aIN/IFG-PFC connections, we observed both increased and decreased between-network connectivity with a tendency for increased within-hemisphere connectivity and reduced cross-hemisphere connectivity in higher BMI pregnancies. Maternal BMI was not associated with global differences in network topography based on network-based statistical analyses. Overall effects were localized in regions that will later support behavioral regulation and integrative processes, regions commonly associated with obesity-related deficits. By establishing onset in neural differences prior to birth, this study supports a model in which maternal BMI-related risk is associated with fetal connectome-level brain organization with implications for offspring long-term cognitive development and mental health."
208,A,"A growing research base demonstrates that adolescents' construction of secure attachment relationships may underlie successful social and personal relationships and healthy behavioral adjustment. Little is known about the early caregiving origins of adolescent attachment security; this study provides some of the first data on this topic. Method The relative contribution of early and current caregiving quality to attachment security in adolescence was assessed in two longitudinal studies of a clinic-referred and an at-risk community sample using identical measures (n = 209). Quality of early parent-child relationships at age 3-7 years of age and parent-adolescent relationship quality at approximately 12 years were assessed using observational methods; psychosocial risk was derived from extensive interview and questionnaire assessments; adolescent attachment quality was assessed using a standard attachment interview. Analyses indicated moderate stability in observed parent-child interaction quality from early childhood to adolescence. Observational ratings of both early childhood and current caregiving quality were significantly associated with adolescent attachment security; however, early caregiver sensitivity was more strongly associated with adolescent attachment security and predicted later attachment security independently from current caregiving quality. Follow-up analyses indicated that this longitudinal prediction was significantly weaker in the clinic than in the at-risk community sample. Parental sensitive responding in childhood has enduring effects on attachment representation in adolescence, independent of current parenting relationship quality. These findings provide important new evidence supporting early parenting interventions for promoting youth well-being and adjustment."
209,A,"Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome (GTS) is a multifaceted neuropsychiatric developmental disorder with onset in childhood or adolescence and frequent remissions in early adulthood. A rather new emerging concept of this syndrome suggests that it is a disorder of purposeful actions, in which sensory processes and their relation to motor responses (actions) play a particularly important role. Thus, this syndrome might be conceived as a condition of altered 'perception-action binding'. In the current study, we test this novel concept in the context of inhibitory control. We examined N = 35 adolescent GTS patients and N = 39 healthy controls in a Go/Nogo-task manipulating the complexity of sensory information triggering identical actions; i.e. to inhibit a motor response. This was combined with event-related potential recordings, EEG data decomposition and source localization. GTS patients showed worse performance compared to controls and larger performance differences when inhibitory control had to be exerted using unimodal visual compared to bimodal auditory-visual stimuli. This suggests increased binding between bimodal stimuli and responses leading to increased costs of switching between responses instructed by bimodal and those instructed by unimodal stimuli. The neurophysiological data showed that this was related to mechanisms mediating between stimulus evaluation and response selection; i.e. perception-action binding processes in the right inferior parietal cortex (BA40). Stimulus-action inhibition binding is stronger in GTS patients than healthy controls and affects inhibitory control corroborating the concept suggesting that GTS might be a condition of altered perception-action integration (binding); i.e. a disorder of purposeful actions."
210,A,"Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often have co-occurring symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and/or anxiety. It is unclear whether these disorders arise from shared or distinct developmental pathways. We explored this question by testing the specificity of early-life (infant and toddler) predictors of mid-childhood ADHD and anxiety symptoms compared to ASD symptoms. Infants (n = 104) at high and low familial risk for ASD took part in research assessments at 7, 14, 24 and 38 months, and 7 years of age. Symptoms of ASD, ADHD and anxiety were measured by parent report at age 7. Activity levels and inhibitory control, also measured by parent report, in infancy and toddlerhood were used as early-life predictors of ADHD symptoms. Fearfulness and shyness measured in infancy and toddlerhood were used as early-life predictors of anxiety symptoms. Correlations and path analysis models tested associations between early-life predictors and mid-childhood ADHD and anxiety symptoms compared to mid-childhood ASD symptoms, and the influence of controlling for ASD symptoms on those associations. Increased activity levels and poor inhibitory control were correlated with ADHD symptoms and not ASD or anxiety; these associations were unchanged in path models controlling for risk-group and ASD symptoms. Increased fearfulness and shyness were correlated with anxiety symptoms, but also ASD symptoms. When controlling for risk-group in path analysis, the association between shyness and anxiety became nonsignificant, and when further controlling for ASD symptoms the association between fearfulness and anxiety became marginal. The specificity of early-life predictors to ADHD symptoms suggests early developmental pathways to ADHD might be distinct from ASD. The overlap in early-life predictors of anxiety and ASD suggests that these disorders are difficult to differentiate early in life, which could reflect the presence of common developmental pathways or convergence in early behavioural manifestations of these disorders."
211,A,"Numerous theories have posited that stressors occurring over the lifespan may exert a cumulative effect on psychological and biological processes that increase individuals' risk for a variety of mental and physical health problems. Given the difficulty associated with assessing lifetime stress exposure, however, few empirical studies have directly tested these cumulative risk models of psychopathology and human health. Method To address this issue, we examined the usability, acceptability, concurrent validity, and predictive validity of the recently developed Stress and Adversity Inventory for Adolescents (Adolescent STRAIN) in 338 youth (M-age = 15.64; 229 females) seeking mental health treatment. The Adolescent STRAIN achieved high acceptability and was completed in approximately 25 min (interquartile range: 20-32 min). Concurrent associations with other measures of early adversity (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form) and interpersonal stress (Revised Peer Experiences Questionnaire) were very good (rs = .50-.59). In analyses that adjusted for participants' age, sex, and race, the STRAIN was significantly associated with depression, anxiety, and anhedonia severity; general mental and physical health complaints; risky behavior engagement; and number of interviewer-based psychiatric diagnoses (beta s = .16-.52; risk ratios = 1.006-1.014). Contrary to classic theories of stress which assume that different stressors exert similar effects on health, substantial differences were observed across the two stressor types, twelve life domains, and five core social-psychological characteristics assessed by the Adolescent STRAIN. These data confirm the relevance of lifetime stress exposure for multiple health outcomes in adolescence, which can in turn inform existing theories of lifespan health. Because stress is a common presenting problem in hospitals and clinics, these data also suggest the possibility of using the Adolescent STRAIN to generate stress exposure profiles for case conceptualization and treatment planning purposes."
212,A,"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is often associated with other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDs) and with risky behaviors and adverse health outcomes, including injuries. Treatment with ADHD medication has been associated with reduced risk of injuries. However, it is unknown whether the association is present in individuals with co-occurring NDs. The aim of the present study was to estimate the association between ADHD medication use and unintentional injuries in Sweden in children and adolescents with ADHD, including those with co-occurring NDs. Using a linkage of several national registers via the unique personal identification number, we identified individuals with a diagnosis of ADHD and of other NDs, including autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, communication disorders, learning disorders and motor disorders. The primary outcome was unintentional injuries. Secondary outcome was traumatic brain injury (TBI). Individuals were followed from January 1st 2006 or their 5th birthday or the date of the first unintentional injury, whichever came last, to December 31st 2013 or their 18th birthday or death, whichever came first. We compared the rate of injuries during periods on-treatment with the rate of injuries during periods off-treatment within the same individual using stratified Cox regression to calculate hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For children and adolescents with ADHD (N = 9,421) the rate of any unintentional injuries (HR = 0.85; 95% CI = 0.78-0.92) and TBIs (HR = 0.27; 95% CIs = 0.20-0.38) during medicated periods was lower than during non-medicated periods. Similar results were found among individuals with co-occurring NDs (N = 2,986), for unintentional injuries (HR = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.77-1.01) and for TBIs (HR = 0.27; 95% CI = 0.16-0.44). Beneficial effects of ADHD medication may extend beyond reduction of ADHD core symptoms to prevention of unintentional injuries in children and adolescents, including individuals with co-occurring NDs."
213,A,"Reading comprehension draws on both decoding and linguistic comprehension, and poor reading comprehension can be the consequence of a deficit in either of these skills. Using outcome data from the longitudinal Wellcome Language and Reading Project, we identified three groups of children at age 8 years: children with dyslexia (N = 21) who had deficits in decoding but not oral language, children with Developmental Language Disorder (DLD; N = 38) whose decoding skills were in the normal range, and children who met criteria for both dyslexia and DLD (N = 29). All three groups had reading comprehension difficulties at the ages of 8 and 9 years relative to TD controls though those of the children with dyslexia were mild (relative to TD controls, d = 0.51 at age 8, d = 0.60 at age 8); while the most severe problems were found in the comorbid dyslexia + DLD group (d = 1.79 at age 8, d = 2.06 at age 9) those with DLD also had significant difficulties (d = 1.56 at age 8, d = 1.56 at age 9). These findings confirm that children with dyslexia or DLD are at-risk for reading comprehension difficulties but for different reasons, because of weak decoding in the case of dyslexia or weak oral language skills in the case of DLD. Different forms of intervention are required for these groups of children, targeted to their particular area(s) of weakness."
214,A,"Care for children and adolescents with psychosocial problems is aimed at reducing problems. There may be a relationship between the intensity and duration of care provision and improvement of these outcomes, but evidence on this issue is lacking. We therefore examined the association between care trajectories based on duration and intensity of care for children, and the reduction in psychosocial problems after 3 years. We obtained a cohort of all children entering psychosocial care in one region (n = 1,378), the TAKECARE cohort, and followed it for 3 years, with five assessment rounds. Retention in the final round was 85.8%. Psychosocial problems were measured using the parent report of the Total Difficulty Score of the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ-TDS). We constructed trajectories for intensity of care using growth mixture modelling and assessed the association between duration and intensity of care trajectories and SDQ-TDS after 3 years. After 3 months 60.6% of children and adolescents were receiving care, after 1 year 38.7% were receiving care and after 3 years 26.0%. Regarding intensity of care, three trajectories were found: one with minimal intensity during all 3 years, a second with initially medium intensity and strong reduction within 1 year, and a third with high intensity and a reduction after 1 year. Although the psychosocial problems of children and adolescents were reduced during the 3-year period, the rate of decline was relatively less marked for children and adolescents with longer care trajectories. Conclusion Overall, children and adolescents with psychosocial problems who received care had improved outcomes at follow-up. However, increased provision of care does not automatically lead to reduction of problems, and although overall psychosocial problems are reduced, a substantial subgroup has longer lasting problems."
215,A,"Objective Restricted and repetitive pattern of behaviours and interests (RRB) are a cardinal feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but there remains uncertainty about how these diverse behaviours vary according to individual characteristics. This study provided the largest exploration to date of the relationship between Repetitive Motor Behaviours, Rigidity/Insistence on Sameness and Circumscribed Interests with other individual characteristics in newly diagnosed individuals with ASD. Method Participants (N = 3,647; 17.7% females; Mage = 6.6 years [SD = 4.7]) were part of the Western Australian (WA) Register for ASD, an independent, prospective collection of demographic and diagnostic data of newly diagnosed cases of ASD in WA. Diagnosticians rated each of the DSM-IV-TR criteria on a 4-point Likert severity scale, and here we focused on the Repetitive Motor Behaviours, Insistence on Sameness and Circumscribed Interests symptoms. The associations between RRB domains, indexed by Kendall's Tau, were weak, ranging from non-significant for both Circumscribed Interests and Repetitive Motor Behaviours to significant (.20) for Insistence on Sameness and Repetitive Motor Behaviours. Older age at diagnosis was significantly associated with lower Circumscribed Interests and significantly associated with higher Insistence on Sameness and Repetitive Motor Behaviours. Male sex was significantly associated with higher Repetitive Motor Behaviours but not Insistence on Sameness or Circumscribed Interests. The pattern of associations identified in this study provides suggestive evidence for the distinctiveness of Repetitive Motor Behaviours, Insistence on Sameness and Circumscribed Interests, highlighting the potential utility of RRB domains for stratifying the larger ASD population into smaller, more phenotypically homogeneous subgroups that can help to facilitate efforts to understand diverse ASD aetiology and inform design of future interventions."
216,A,"Given the role of childhood aggressive behavior (AGG) in everyday child development, precise and accurate measurement is critical in clinical practice and research. This study aims to quantify agreement among widely used measures of childhood AGG regarding item content, clinical concordance, correlation, and underlying genetic construct. We analyzed data from 1254 Dutch twin pairs (age 8-10 years, 51.1% boys) from a general population sample for whom both parents completed the A-TAC, CBCL, and SDQ at the same occasion. There was substantial variation in item content among AGG measures, ranging from .00 (i.e., mutually exclusive) to .50 (moderate agreement). Clinical concordance (i.e., do the same children score above a clinical threshold among AGG measures) was very weak to moderate with estimates ranging between .01 and .43 for mother-reports and between .12 and .42 for father-reports. Correlations among scales were weak to strong, ranging from .32 to .70 for mother-reports and from .32 to .64 for father-reports. We found weak to very strong genetic correlations among the measures, with estimates between .65 and .84 for mother-reports and between .30 and .87 for father-reports. Our results demonstrated that degree of agreement between measures of AGG depends on the type (i.e., item content, clinical concordance, correlation, genetic correlation) of agreement considered. Because agreement was higher for correlations compared to clinical concordance (i.e., above or below a clinical cutoff), we propose the use of continuous scores to assess AGG, especially for combining data with different measures. Although item content can be different and agreement among observed measures may not be high, the genetic correlations indicate that the underlying genetic liability for childhood AGG is consistent across measures."
217,A,"Self-conscious emotional reactivity and its physiological marker - blushing has been proposed to be an etiological mechanism of social anxiety disorder (SAD), but so far, untested in longitudinal designs. This study tested, for the first time, whether self-conscious emotional reactivity (indexed as physiological blushing) contributes to the development of SAD symptoms over and above social behavioral inhibition (BI), which has been identified as the strongest predictor of SAD development in early childhood. One hundred fifteen children (45% boys) and their mothers and fathers participated at ages 2.5, 4.5, and 7.5 years. Social BI was observed at all time points in a stranger approach task, and physiological blushing (blood volume, blood pulse amplitude, and temperature increases) was measured during a public performance (singing) and watching back the performance at ages 4.5 and 7.5. Child early social anxiety was reported by both parents at 4.5 years, and SAD symptoms were diagnosed by clinicians and reported by both parents at 7.5 years. Higher social BI at 2.5 and 4.5 years predicted greater social anxiety at 4.5 years, which, in turn, predicted SAD symptoms at 7.5 years. Blushing (temperature increase) at 4.5 years predicted SAD symptoms at 7.5 years over and above the influence of social BI and early social anxiety. That blushing uniquely contributes to the development of SAD symptoms over and above social BI suggests two pathways to childhood SAD: one that entails early high social BI and an early onset of social anxiety symptoms, and the other that consists of heightened self-conscious emotional reactivity (i.e. blushing) in early childhood."
218,A,"Based on previous findings from the Wirral Child Health and Development Study (WCHADS), and on evolutionary hypotheses, we preregistered analyses of data from a large epidemiological sample (), to test for sex-dependent moderation by prenatal maternal depressive symptoms of the association between postnatal maternal depressive symptoms and child emotional problems. A total of 8,354 mothers and children were followed from pregnancy to 3.5 years in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Self-report measures of prenatal and postnatal maternal depressive symptoms, and maternal report of child emotional symptoms were administered. There was a three-way interaction between maternal prenatal and postnatal depression, and child sex (Coeff .042 95% CI 0.015 to 0.068, p = .002). This arose from moderation by prenatal depression, in opposite directions in boys and in girls. In boys, the association between postnatal depression and child emotional symptoms was weaker following lower prenatal depressive symptoms (interaction term coeff = .030, p = .001), and in girls, to a lesser extent, the association was stronger following lower prenatal depressive symptoms (interaction term coeff = -.012, p = .221). We replicated the finding from the WCHADS that prenatal depression modifies the association between postnatal depression and children's emotional problems in a sex-dependent fashion. In ALSPAC, the sex difference was explained mainly by a protective effect of low prenatal depression in boys, while in WCHADS, it arose from greater vulnerability of girls to postnatal depression following low prenatal depression. In the light of these findings, in evaluating and implementing early interventions, there is need to consider that risks associated with postnatal depression may vary depending on maternal mood during pregnancy and may differ between boys and girls."
219,A,"Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are generally considered early-onset disorders so most research has therefore tended to focus on children. Differences between ADHD/ASD in adult life and childhood have been noted, but few population-based studies have examined them in adulthood. Furthermore, the interpretation of findings is hampered by changes in measure and from parent report to self-report. Method We examined continuous/trait measures of parent- and self-rated ADHD and ASD in adulthood (age 25 years) in a UK prospective longitudinal sample ALPSAC (the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children), using many of the same measures that parents reported on in childhood (N = 6,064). Our aim was to investigate these traits in this population for mean-level sex differences, overlaps with other cognitive, learning and communication problems and their associations with polygenic risk scores (PRS) for neuropsychiatric disorders (ADHD, ASD, schizophrenia, depression and anxiety). ADHD and ASD traits in adulthood, as in childhood, showed associations with childhood cognitive, learning and communication problems and adult communication/language measures, although less so for self-ratings than parent-ratings. Males had higher ADHD and ASD trait levels, but this was not as marked as in childhood. In adulthood, ADHD (both parent- and self-rated) and ASD (parent-rated) symptoms showed associations with ADHD PRS; self-reported ADHD also showed association with depression PRS, whereas self-reported ASD did not show strong PRS associations. Our findings suggest that in young adults, ADHD and ASD symptoms have similar characteristics as they do in childhood. Associations with other cognitive, learning and communication problems, and ADHD PRS were somewhat less pronounced for self-reported adult ADHD and ASD symptoms, suggesting that even at age 25, parent reports, where available, could be clinically useful."
220,C,"NASA's Kepler mission revealed that similar to 30% of Solar-type stars harbour planets with sizes between that of Earth and Neptune on nearly circular and coplanar orbits with periods less than 100 days(1-4). Such short-period compact systems are rarely found with planet pairs in mean-motion resonances (MMRs)-configurations in which the planetary orbital periods exhibit a simple integer ratio-but there is a significant overabundance of planet pairs lying just wide of the first-order resonances(5). Previous work suggests that tides raised on the planets by the host star may be responsible for forcing systems into these configurations by draining orbital energy to heat(6-8). Such tides, however, are insufficient unless there exists a substantial and as-yet-unidentified source of extra dissipation(9,10). Here we show that this cryptic heat source may be linked to 'obliquity tides' generated when a large axial tilt (obliquity) is maintained by secular resonance-driven spin-orbit coupling. We present evidence that typical compact, nearly coplanar systems frequently experience this mechanism, and we highlight additional features in the planetary orbital period and radius distributions that may be its signatures. Extrasolar planets that maintain large obliquities will exhibit infrared light curve features that are detectable with forthcoming space missions. The observed period ratio distribution can be explained if typical tidal quality factors for super-Earths and sub-Neptunes are similar to those of Uranus and Neptune."
221,C,"The final steps of the evolution of massive stars leading to a supernova explosion, in particular the mass-loss mechanism, is an important open problem in astrophysics. Strippedenvelope supernovae (SESNe) are explosions of massive stars where a large amount of the outer envelope has been stripped away before the explosion: types IIb, Ib and Ic in order of increasing degree of envelope stripping(1-3). In this work, an analysis of late-time nebular spectra of SESNe is presented. The results show that the progenitors of SNe IIb and lb are indistinguishable except for the residual amount of the H-rich envelope. The progenitors of SNe Ic are distinctly different in the nature of the carbon-oxygen (C+O) core, which is interpreted to be more massive than in SNe IIb and Ib. These findings strongly suggest that different mechanisms are responsible for the removal of the outer H-rich envelope and the deeper He-rich layer."
222,C,"Enhanced mid-infrared emission from CH4 and other stratospheric hydrocarbons has been observed coincident with Jupiter's ultraviolet auroral emission(1-3). This suggests that auroral processes and the neutral stratosphere of Jupiter are coupled; however, the exact nature of this coupling is unknown. Here we present a time series of Subaru-COMICS images of Jupiter measured at a wavelength of 7.80 mu m on 11-14 January, 4-5 February and 17-20 May 2017. These data show that both the morphology and magnitude of the auroral CH4 emission vary on daily timescales in relation to external solar-wind conditions. The southern auroral CH4 emission increased in brightness temperature by about 3.8 K between 15:50 UT, 11 January and 12:57 UT, 12 January, during a predicted solar-wind compression. During the same compression, the northern auroral emission exhibited a duskside brightening, which mimics the morphology observed in the ultraviolet auroral emission during periods of enhanced solar-wind pressure(4,5). These results suggest that changes in external solar-wind conditions perturb the Jovian magnetosphere in such a way that energetic particles are accelerated into the planet's atmosphere, deposit their energy as deep as the neutral stratosphere, and modify the thermal structure, the abundance of CH4 or the population of energy states of CH4. We also find that the northern and southern auroral CH4 emission evolved independently between the January, February and May images, as has been observed at X-ray wavelengths over shorter timescales(6) and at mid-infrared wavelengths over longer timescales(7)."
223,C,"The presence of winds in Titan's lower and middle atmosphere has been determined by a variety of techniques, including direct measurements from the Huygens Probe(1) over 0-150 km; Doppler shifts of molecular spectral lines in the optical, thermal infrared and millimetre ranges(2-4), which together have probed the similar to 100-450 km altitude range; inferences from the thermal field over 10-0.001 mbar (that is, similar to 100-500 km)(5,6); and inferences from central flashes in stellar occultation curves(7-9). These measurements predominantly indicated strong prograde winds, reaching maximum speeds of similar to 150-200 m s(-1) in the upper stratosphere, with important latitudinal and seasonal variations. However, these observations provided incomplete atmospheric sounding; in particular, the wind regime in Titan's upper mesosphere and thermosphere (500-1,200 km) has remained unconstrained so far. Here we report direct wind measurements based on Doppler shifts of six molecular species observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). We show that contrary to expectations, strong prograde winds extend up to the thermosphere, with the circulation progressively turning into an equatorial jet regime as the altitude increases, reaching similar to 340 m s(-1) at 1,000 km. We suggest that these winds may represent the dynamical response of forcing by waves launched at upper stratospheric/mesospheric levels and/or of magnetospheric-ionospheric interaction. We also demonstrate that the distribution of the hydrogen isocyanide (HNC) molecule is restricted to Titan's thermosphere above similar to 870 km altitude."
224,C,"Some highly irradiated close-in exoplanets orbit stars showing anomalously low stellar chromospheric emission. We attribute this deficit to absorption by circumstellar gas replenished by mass loss from ablating planets. Here we report statistics validating this hypothesis. Among similar to 3,000 nearby, bright, main-sequence stars, similar to 40 show depressed chromospheric emission indicative of undiscovered mass-losing planets. The Dispersed Matter Planet Project uses high-precision, high-cadence radial velocity (RV) measurements to detect these planets. We summarize results for two planetary systems (DMPP-1 and DMPP-3) and fully present observations revealing an M-p sin i = 0.469 M-J planet in a 5.207 d orbit around the gamma Doradus pulsator HD 11231 (DMPP-2). We have detected short-period planets wherever we have made more than 60 RV measurements, demonstrating that we have originated a very efficient method for detecting nearby compact planetary systems. These shrouded, ablating planetary systems may be a short-lived phase related to the Neptunian desert, that is, the dearth of intermediate-mass planets at short orbital periods. The circumstellar gas facilitates compositional analysis, allowing empirical exogeology in the cases of sublimating rocky planets. Dispersed Matter Planet Project discoveries will be important for establishing the empirical mass-radius-composition relationship(s) for low-mass planets."
225,C,"Star DMPP-1 hosts a compact, four-planet system comprising three irradiated super-Earth-mass planets and one Neptune-mass planet, discovered through radial velocity measurements and the star's anomalously low chromospheric emission. To put the Solar System's terrestrial planets in context, the detection and characterization of low-mass exoplanets is important but challenging. The Dispersed Matter Planet Project targets stars with anomalously low Ca ii H and K chromospheric emission, indicative of circumstellar absorbing gas. Here we report high-precision, high-cadence radial-velocity measurements of the F8V star DMPP-1 (HD 38677). These were motivated by depressed Ca ii H and K line cores indicative of short-period, ablating planets producing circumstellar gas. We find a compact planetary system with orbital periods of about 2.9-19 days, comprising three super-Earth-mass planets (about 3-10 M-circle plus) and one Neptune-mass planet (about 24 M-circle plus). The irradiated super-Earths may be remnant cores of giant planets after mass loss while crossing the Neptune desert. A priori inferences about the presence of short-period planets enabled the efficient discovery of the DMPP-1 planets. We anticipate informative follow-up characterization studies."
226,C,"The motions of gas and stars in the nuclei of nearby galaxies have demonstrated that massive black holes are common(1) and that their masses correlate with the stellar velocity dispersion s. of the bulge(2-4). This correlation suggests that massive black holes and galaxies influence each other's growth(5-7). Dynamical measurements are less reliable when the sphere of influence is unresolved; thus, it remains unknown whether this correlation exists in galaxies much smaller than the Milky Way. Light echoes from photoionized clouds around accreting black holes(8,9), in combination with the velocity of these clouds, yield a direct mass measurement that circumvents this difficulty. Here we report an exceptionally low reverberation delay of 83 +/- 14 min between variability in the accretion disk and Ha emission from the nucleus of the dwarf galaxy NGC 4395. Combined with the Ha velocity dispersion sline = 426 +/- 1 km s(-1), this lag determines a mass of about 10,000 M. for the black hole (M-BH). This mass is among the smallest central black hole masses reported, near the low end of expected masses for heavy 'seeds'(10-12), and the best direct mass measurement for a galaxy of this size. Despite the lack of a bulge, NGC 4395 is consistent with the M-BH-sigma(*) relation, indicating that the relation need not originate from hierarchical galaxy assembly nor from black hole feedback."
227,C,"One of the primary goals of exoplanetary science is to detect small, temperate planets passing (transiting) in front of bright and quiet host stars. This enables the characterization of planetary sizes, orbits, bulk compositions, atmospheres and formation histories. These studies are facilitated by small and cool M dwarf host stars. Here we report the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)(1) discovery of three small planets transiting one of the nearest and brightest M dwarf hosts observed to date, TOI-270 (TIC 259377017, with K-magnitude 8.3, and 22.5 parsecs away from Earth). The M3V-type star is transited by the super-Earth-sized planet TOI-270 b (1.247(-0.083)(+0.089) R-circle plus) and the sub-Neptune-sized planets TOI-270 c (2.42 +/- 0.13 R-circle plus) and TOI-270 d (2.13 +/- 0.12 R-circle plus). The planets orbit close to a mean-motion resonant chain, with periods (3.36 days, 5.66 days and 11.38 days, respectively) near ratios of small integers (5:3 and 2:1). TOI-270 is a prime target for future studies because (1) its near-resonance allows the detection of transit timing variations, enabling precise mass measurements and dynamical studies; (2) its brightness enables independent radial-velocity mass measurements; (3) the outer planets are ideal for atmospheric characterization via transmission spectroscopy; and (4) the quietness of the star enables future searches for habitable zone planets. Altogether, very few systems with small, temperate exoplanets are as suitable for such complementary and detailed characterization as TOI-270."
228,C,"Ultra-wideband, three-dimensional (3D) imaging spectrometry in the millimeter-submillimeter (mm-submm) band is an essential tool for uncovering the dust-enshrouded portion of the cosmic history of star formation and galaxy evolution(1-3). However, it is challenging to scale up conventional coherent heterodyne receivers(4) or free-space diffraction techniques(5) to sufficient bandwidths (>= 1 octave) and numbers of spatial pixels(2,3) (>10(2)). Here, we present the design and astronomical spectra of an intrinsically scalable, integrated superconducting spectrometer(6), which covers 332-377 GHz with a spectral resolution of F/Delta F similar to 380. It combines the multiplexing advantage of microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs)(7) with planar superconducting filters for dispersing the signal in a single, small superconducting integrated circuit. We demonstrate the two key applications for an instrument of this type: as an efficient redshift machine and as a fast multi-line spectral mapper of extended areas. The line detection sensitivity is in excellent agreement with the instrument design and laboratory performance, reaching the atmospheric foreground photon noise limit on-sky. The design can be scaled to band-widths in excess of an octave, spectral resolution up to a few thousand and frequencies up to similar to 1.1 THz. The miniature chip footprint of a few cm(2) allows for compact multi-pixel spectral imagers, which would enable spectroscopic direct imaging and large-volume spectroscopic surveys that are several orders of magnitude faster than what is currently possible(1-3)."
229,C,"Using two independent laser frequency combs to calibrate an astronomical spectrometer, researchers demonstrate a stability of similar to 1 cm s(-1), which is required for detecting low-mass rocky exoplanets around Sun-like stars. Laser frequency combs (LFCs) are well on their way to becoming the next-generation calibration sources for precision astronomical spectroscopy(1-6). This development is considered key in the hunt for low-mass rocky exoplanets around solar-type stars whose discovery with the radial-velocity method requires cm s(-1) Doppler precision(7). In order to prove such precise calibration with an LFC, it must be compared to another calibrator of at least the same precision. Being the best available spectrograph calibrator, this means comparing it to a second-fully independent-LFC. Here, we report on a test in which two separate LFCs were used to simultaneously calibrate an astronomical spectrograph. Our installation of two LFCs at the ultra-stable two-channel spectrograph HARPS allowed characterization of their relative stability and consistency in calibration at the highest available level. Although the test was limited in time, the results confirm the 1 cm s(-1) stability that has long been anticipated by the astronomical community."
230,C,"X-ray reverberation echoes are assumed to be produced in the strongly distorted spacetime around accreting supermassive black holes. This signal allows us to spatially map the geometry of the inner accretion flow(1,2)-a region that cannot yet be spatially resolved by any telescope-and provides a direct measure of the black hole mass and spin. The reverberation timescale is set by the light travel path between the direct emission from a hot X-ray corona and the reprocessed emission from the inner edge of the accretion disk(3-6). However, there is an inherent degeneracy in the reverberation signal between black hole mass, inner disk radius and height of the illuminating corona above the disk. Here we use a long X-ray observation of the highly variable active galaxy IRAS 13224-3809 to track the reverberation signal as the system evolves on timescales of a day(7,8). With the inclusion of all the relativistic effects, modelling reveals that the height of the X-ray corona increases with increasing luminosity, providing a dynamic view of the inner accretion region. This simultaneous modelling allows us to break the inherent degeneracies and obtain an independent timing-based estimate for the mass and spin of the black hole. The uncertainty on black hole mass is comparable to the leading optical reverberation method(9), making X-ray reverberation a powerful technique, particularly for sources with low optical variability(10). Relativistic modelling of long X-ray observations of a highly variable active galaxy reveals that the height of its X-ray corona increases with increasing luminosity. X-ray reverberation is shown to be a powerful technique to measure black hole masses."
231,C,"Spectroscopic simulations of exoplanetary atmospheres show that our best chance to detect molecular oxygen lies in the 6.4-mu m band of collision-induced absorptions. The first detections could be possible with the James Webb Space Telescope. The collision-induced fundamental vibration-rotation band at 6.4 mu m is the strongest absorption feature from O-2 in the infrared(1-3), yet it has not been previously incorporated into exoplanet spectral analyses for several reasons. Either collision-induced absorptions (CIAs) were not included or incomplete/obsolete CIA databases were used. Also, the current version of HITRAN does not include CIAs at 6.4 mu m with other collision partners (O-2-X). We include O-2-X CIA features in our transmission spectroscopy simulations by parameterizing the 6.4-mu m O-2-N-2 CIA based on ref. (3) and the O-2-CO2 CIA based on ref. (4). Here we report that the O-2-X CIA may be the most detectable O-2 feature for transit observations. For a potential TRAPPIST-1 e analogue system within 5 pc of the Sun, it could be the only O-2 signature detectable with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) (using MIRI LRS (Mid-Infrared Instrument low-resolution spectrometer)) for a modern Earth-like cloudy atmosphere with biological quantities of O-2. Also, we show that the 6.4-mu m O-2-X CIA would be prominent for O-2-rich desiccated atmospheres(5) and could be detectable with JWST in just a few transits. For systems beyond 5 pc, this feature could therefore be a powerful discriminator of uninhabited planets with non-biological 'false-positive' O-2 in their atmospheres, as they would only be detectable at these higher O-2 pressures."
232,C,"One interpretation of the activity and magnetism of late-type stars is that these both intensify with decreasing Rossby number up to a saturation level(1-3), suggesting that stellar dynamos depend on both rotation and convective turbulence(4). Some studies have claimed, however, that rotation alone suffices to parametrize this scaling adequately(5,6). Here, we tackle the question of the relevance of turbulence to stellar dynamos by including evolved, post-main-sequence stars in the analysis of the rotation-activity relation. These stars rotate very slowly compared with main-sequence stars, but exhibit similar activity levels(7). We show that the two evolutionary stages fall together in the rotation-activity diagram and form a single sequence in the unsaturated regime in relation only to Rossby numbers derived from stellar models, confirming earlier preliminary results that relied on a more simplistic parametrization of the convective turn-over time(8,9). This mirrors recent results of fully convective M dwarfs, which likewise fall on the same rotation-activity sequence as partially convective solar-type stars(10,11). Our results demonstrate that turbulence plays a crucial role in driving stellar dynamos and suggest that there is a common turbulence-related dynamo mechanism explaining the magnetic activity of all late-type stars. Uniform analysis of both main-sequence and evolved, post-main-sequence stars shows that a common, turbulence-dependent, dynamo mechanism operates throughout these stages of stellar evolution."
233,C,"The properties of neutron stars are determined by the nature of the matter that they contain. These properties can be constrained by measurements of the star's size. We obtain stringent constraints on neutron-star radii by combining multimessenger observations of the binary neutron-star merger GW170817 with nuclear theory that best accounts for density-dependent uncertainties in the equation of state. We construct equations of state constrained by chiral effective field theory and marginalize over these using the gravitational-wave observations. Combining this with the electromagnetic observations of the merger remnant that imply the presence of a short-lived hypermassive neutron star, we find that the radius of a 1.4 M-circle dot neutron star is R1.4M circle dot=11.0-0.6+0.9km (90% credible interval). Using this constraint, we show that neutron stars are unlikely to be disrupted in neutron star-black hole mergers; subsequently, such events will not produce observable electromagnetic emission."
234,A,"The Extended Strengths and Weaknesses Assessment of Normal Behavior (E-SWAN) reconceptualizes each diagnostic criterion for selected DSM-5 disorders as a behavior, which can range from high (strengths) to low (weaknesses). Initial development focused on Panic Disorder, Social Anxiety, Major Depression, and Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder. Data were collected from 523 participants (ages 6-17). Parents completed each of the four E-SWAN scales and traditional unidirectional scales addressing the same disorders. Distributional properties, Item Response Theory Analysis (IRT), and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess and compare the performance of E-SWAN and traditional scales. In contrast to the traditional scales, which exhibited truncated distributions, all four E-SWAN scales had symmetric distributions. IRT analyses indicate the E-SWAN subscales provided reliable information about respondents throughout the population distribution; traditional scales only provided reliable information about respondents at the high end of the distribution. Predictive value for DSM-5 diagnoses was comparable to prior scales. E-SWAN bidirectional scales can capture the full spectrum of the population distribution of behavior underlying DSM disorders. The additional information provided can better inform examination of inter-individual variation in population studies, as well as facilitate the identification of factors related to resiliency in clinical samples."
235,A,"Reading is important for children's success in school and beyond, yet many adolescents fail to reach expected levels of proficiency. This highlights the need to better understand the factors that influence reading effectiveness over time, including genes and environment. Greater expression of genetic influence on first- and second-grade reading fluency has been observed in higher quality classroom reading environments. To what degree this early environment continues to influence genetic and other environmental influences on later reading is unknown and was tested in this study. The quality of the early classroom reading environment was approximated by gains in oral reading fluency (ORF) across the school year among first- or second-grade classmates of 546 MZ and 1,016 DZ twin children (mean age = 7.13 years; SD = 0.45) who had reading comprehension scores from a state-wide mandatory test in school year 2013-2014 when most twin pairs were in seventh to tenth grade (mean age = 14.41; SD = 1.13) in a variable called Class ORF Gain. Biometrical models were fit to the data to assess whether Class ORF Gain moderated the genetic, shared environmental and/or nonshared environmental variance associated with adolescent reading comprehension. Class ORF Gain moderated shared environmental influences on reading comprehension 6-9 years later. When early classroom reading gains were poor, variability in reading comprehension in adolescence was high and was associated largely with shared environmental influences. When early classroom reading gains were good, overall and shared environmentally influenced variability in adolescent reading comprehension was lower so that genetic influences were most relevant in explaining that variability. Our findings suggested that classroom reading environment experienced when children were learning to read had a lasting influence on the factors underlying variability in later reading effectiveness."
236,A,"Objective Children with low self-control who grow up in poverty are at elevated risk for living in poverty when they are adults. The purpose of this study was to further understanding of the intergenerational continuity of poverty by (a) examining the likelihood that children with low levels of self-control at age 11 earn less employment income and are more likely to live in poverty 14 years later, at age 25; and (b) determining, via a preventive intervention, whether enhancing supportive parenting during childhood will ameliorate these associations. Parents and their 11-year-old children from 381 families participated in the Strong African American Families (SAAF) program or a control condition. Teachers assessed children's self-control at 11 years; parents reported their use of supportive parenting when children were 11 and 13 years; emerging adults provided data on cognitive and emotional self-control at 19, 20, and 21 years; and young adults indicated their employment income at 25 years. Significant two-way interactions were detected between children's self-control and prevention condition for employment income (b = -183.18, 95% CI [-363.82, -2.53], p < .05) and poverty status (b = 0.257, 95% CI [0.018, 0.497], p < .05). Low self-control at age 11 forecast less employment income and a greater likelihood of living in poverty among children in the control condition, but not among low self-control SAAF participants. Mediated moderation analyses confirmed that enhanced supportive parenting accounted for SAAF's effects on employment income (indirect effect = 63.057, 95% BCA [19.385, 124.748]) and poverty status (indirect effect = -0.071, 95% BCA [-0.165, -0.016]). This study is unique in using a randomized controlled trial to show that preventive interventions designed to enhance parenting and strengthen families can buffer the long-term economic consequences of low self-control."
237,A,"Objective To classify a cohort of depressed adolescents recruited to the UK IMPACT trial, according to trajectories of symptom change. We examined for predictors and compared the data-driven categories of patients with a priori operational definitions of treatment response. Method Secondary data analysis using growth mixture modelling (GMM). Missing data were imputed. Trajectories of self-reported depressive symptoms were plotted using scores taken at six nominal time points over 86 weeks from randomisation in all 465 patients. A piecewise GMM categorised patients into two classes with initially similar and subsequently distinct trajectories. Both groups had a significant decline in depressive symptoms over the first 18 weeks. Eighty-four per cent (84.1%, n = 391) of patients were classed as 'continued-improvers' with symptoms reducing over the duration of the study. A further class of 15.9% (n = 74) of patients were termed 'halted-improvers' with higher baseline depression scores, faster early recovery but no further improvement after 18 weeks. Presence of baseline comorbidity somewhat increased membership to the halted-improvers class (OR = 1.40, CI: 1.00-1.96). By end of study, compared with classes, a clinical remission cut-off score (<= 27) and a symptom reduction score (>= 50%) indexing treatment response misclassified 15% and 31% of cases, respectively. A fast reduction in depressive symptoms in the first few weeks of treatment may not indicate a good prognosis. Halted improvement is only seen after 18 weeks of treatment. Longitudinal modelling may improve the precision of revealing differential responses to treatment. Improvement in depressive symptoms may be somewhat better in the year after treatment than previously considered."
238,A,"BackgroundThe latest version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) proposes a posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnosis reduced to its core symptoms within the symptom clusters re-experiencing, avoidance and hyperarousal. Since children and adolescents often show a variety of internalizing and externalizing symptoms in the aftermath of traumatic events, the question arises whether such a conceptualization of the PTSD diagnosis is supported in children and adolescents. Furthermore, although dysfunctional posttraumatic cognitions (PTCs) appear to play an important role in the development and persistence of PTSD in children and adolescents, their function within diagnostic frameworks requires clarification. MethodsWe compiled a large international data set of 2,313 children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years exposed to trauma and calculated a network model including dysfunctional PTCs, PTSD core symptoms and depression symptoms. Central items and relations between constructs were investigated. ResultsThe PTSD re-experiencing symptoms strong or overwhelming emotions and strong physical sensations and the depression symptom difficulty concentrating emerged as most central. Items from the same construct were more strongly connected with each other than with items from the other constructs. Dysfunctional PTCs were not more strongly connected to core PTSD symptoms than to depression symptoms. ConclusionsOur findings provide support that a PTSD diagnosis reduced to its core symptoms could help to disentangle PTSD, depression and dysfunctional PTCs. Using longitudinal data and complementing between-subject with within-subject analyses might provide further insight into the relationship between dysfunctional PTCs, PTSD and depression."
239,A,"Borderline personality disorder (BPD) typically onsets in adolescence and predicts later functional disability in adulthood. Highly structured evidence-based psychotherapeutic programs, including mentalization-based treatment (MBT), are first choice treatment. The efficacy of MBT for BPD has mainly been tested with adults, and no RCT has examined the effectiveness of MBT in groups (MBT-G) for adolescent BPD. Method A total of 112 adolescents (111 females) with BPD (106) or BPD symptoms >= 4 DSM-5 criteria (5) referred to child and adolescent psychiatric outpatient clinics were randomized to a 1-year MBT-G, consisting of three introductory, psychoeducative sessions, 37 weekly group sessions, five individual case formulation sessions, and six group sessions for caregivers, or treatment as usual (TAU) with at least 12 monthly individual sessions. The primary outcome was the score on the borderline personality features scale for children (BPFS-C); secondary outcomes included self-harm, depression, externalizing and internalizing symptoms (all self-report), caregiver reports, social functioning, and borderline symptoms rated by blinded clinicians. Outcome assessments were made at baseline, after 10, 20, and 30 weeks, and at end of treatment (EOT). The ClinicalTrials.gov identifier is NCT02068326. At EOT, the primary outcome was 71.3 (SD = 15.0) in the MBT-G group and 71.3 (SD = 15.2) in the TAU group (adjusted mean difference 0.4 BPFS-C units in favor of MBT-G, 95% confidence interval -6.3 to 7.1, p = .91). No significant group differences were found in the secondary outcomes. 29% in both groups remitted. 29% of the MBT group completed less than half of the sessions compared with 7% of the control group. There is no indication for superiority of either therapy method. The low remission rate points to the importance of continued research into early intervention. Specifically, retention problems need to be addressed."
240,A,"Few epidemiological data on autism spectrum disorders (ASD) exist for Arabic countries. We conducted the first survey of ASD in Qatar, a population with high consanguinity level. This cross-sectional survey was conducted from 2015 to 2018 in Qatar school-age children (N = 176,960) from national and immigrant families. Children diagnosed with ASD were identified through medical centers and special needs schools. Records were abstracted and supplemented by parental interviews. Additionally, children attending 93 schools were screened; ASD case status was confirmed in random samples of screen-positive and screen-negative children. Prevalence was estimated after taking into account different sampling fractions and participation rates at each survey phase. One thousand three hundred and ninety-three children already diagnosed with ASD were identified. Among 9,074 school survey participants, 760 screen-negative children and 163 screen-positive children were evaluated; 17 were confirmed to have ASD including five children newly diagnosed. Prevalence was 1.14% (95% CI: 0.89-1.46) among 6- to 11-year-olds. ASD was reported in full siblings/extended relatives in 5.9% (95% CI: 0.042-0.080)/11.8% (95% CI: 0.095-0.146) families. First-degree consanguinity in Qatari cases (45%) was comparable to known population levels. Among 844 ASD cases (mean age: 7.2 years; 81% male), most children experienced language delay (words: 75.1%; phrase speech: 91.4%), and 19.4% reported developmental regression. At the time of the survey, persisting deficits in expressive language (19.4%) and peer interactions (14.0%) were reported in conjunction with behavioral problems (ADHD: 30.2%; anxiety: 11.0%). In multivariate logistic regression, ASD severity was associated with parental consanguinity, gestational diabetes, delay in walking, and developmental regression. ASD prevalence in Qatar is consistent with recent international studies. The methods employed in this study should help designing comparable surveys in the region. We estimated that 187,000 youths under age 20 have ASD in Gulf countries. This figure should assist in planning health and educational services for a young, fast-growing population."
241,A,"Population-based and family studies showed that impulsive-aggression predicts suicidality; however, the underlying etiological nature of this association is poorly understood. The objective was to determine the contribution of genes and environment to the association between childhood impulsive-aggression and serious suicidal ideation/attempt in young adulthood. N = 862 twins (435 families) from the Quebec Newborn Twin Study were followed up from birth to 20 years. Repeated measures of teacher-assessed impulsive-aggression were modeled using a genetically informed latent growth model including intercept and slope parameters reflecting individual differences in the baseline level (age 6 years) and in the change (increase/decrease) of impulsive-aggression during childhood (6 to 12 years), respectively. Lifetime suicidality (serious suicidal ideation/attempt) was self-reported at 20 years. Associations of impulsive-aggression intercept and slope with suicidality were decomposed into additive genetic (A) and unique environmental (E) components. Additive genetic factors accounted for an important part of individual differences in impulsive-aggression intercept (A = 90%, E = 10%) and slope (A = 65%, E = 35%). Genetic (50%) and unique environmental (50%) factors equally contributed to suicidality. We found that 38% of the genetic factors accounting for suicidality were shared with those underlying impulsive-aggression slope, whereas 40% of the environmental factors accounting for suicidality were shared with those associated with impulsive-aggression intercept. The genetic correlation between impulsive-aggression slope and suicidality was 0.60, p = .027. Genetic and unique environmental factors underlying suicidality significantly overlap with those underlying childhood impulsive-aggression. Future studies should identify putative genetic and environmental factors to inform prevention."
242,A,"Using data from the English & Romanian Adoptees (ERA) study, we recently reported that early time-limited exposure to severe institutional deprivation is associated with early-onset and persistent neurodevelopmental problems and later-onset emotional problems. Here, we examine possible reasons for the late emergence of emotional problems in this cohort. Our main focus is on testing a developmental cascade mediated via the functional impact of early-appearing neurodevelopmental problems on late adolescent functioning. We also explore a second putative pathway via sensitization to stress. The ERA study includes 165 Romanian individuals who spent their early lives in grossly depriving institutions and were subsequently adopted into UK families, along with 52 UK adoptees with no history of deprivation. Age six years symptoms of neurodevelopmental problems and age 15 anxiety/depression symptoms were assessed via parental reports. Young adult symptoms of depression and anxiety were assessed by both parent and self-reports; young adults also completed measures of stress reactivity, exposure to adverse life events, and functioning in work and interpersonal relationships. The path between early institutional deprivation and adult emotional problems was mediated via the impact of early neurodevelopmental problems on unemployment and poor friendship functioning during the transition to adulthood. The findings with regard to early deprivation, later life stress reactivity, and emotional problems were inconclusive. Our analysis suggests that the risk for adult depression and anxiety following extreme institutional deprivation is explained through the effects of early neurodevelopmental problems on later social and vocational functioning. Future research should more fully examine the role of stress susceptibility in this model."
243,A,"The dominant view based on the deficit model of developmental psychopathology is that early adverse rearing impairs cognition. In contrast, an emerging evolutionary-developmental model argues that individuals exposed to early-life stress may have improved cognitive abilities that are adapted to harsh environments. We set out to test this hypothesis by examining cognitive functions in parentally deprived children in Nigeria. Cognitive performance was compared between 53 deprived children who currently live in institutional homes and foster families and 51 nondeprived control participants. We used a multifaceted neurocognitive test battery for the assessment of inhibition, set-shifting and working memory. showed that the deprived and nondeprived group did not significantly differ in their performance on set-shifting and inhibition tasks. Conversely, the deprived group performed significantly better than the nondeprived group in the working memory task. Discussion We interpret the enhanced working memory ability of the deprived group as a correlate of its ecological relevance. In Nigeria, underprivileged children may need to rely to a larger extent on working memory abilities to attain success through academic work. This study provides further evidence that exposure to early adversity does not necessarily impair cognitive functions but can even enhance it under some conditions and in some domains."
244,A,"Sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) is a construct that includes symptoms of slowness, excessive daydreaming, and drowsiness. SCT is often comorbid with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and SCT symptoms are associated with significant academic impairment above the influence of ADHD. Despite the overlap between ADHD and SCT and associated impairments, no studies have evaluated how evidence-based psychosocial interventions for adolescents with ADHD impact symptoms of SCT. This study examined whether SCT symptoms improved in a sample of 274 young adolescents with ADHD who were randomly assigned to an organizational skills intervention, homework completion intervention, or to a waitlist control. SCT intervention response was evaluated broadly in all participants and, specifically, for participants in the clinical range for SCT symptom severity at baseline. Change in ADHD symptoms of inattention, executive functioning, and motivation were examined as potential predictors of improvement in SCT. The two intervention groups were collapsed together for analyses because there were no significant differences in change in SCT symptoms. Multilevel modeling results indicate that parent-reported SCT symptoms significantly decreased when comparing the intervention group to waitlist control (d = .410). For adolescents with parent-reported clinical levels of SCT, the decrease in symptoms was more pronounced (d = .517). Self-reported SCT symptoms produced null results, though effect size calculations showed small improvement for the full sample (d = .313) and for the high-SCT group (d = .384). Change in behavior regulation executive functioning (d = .247), metacognitive executive functioning (d = .346), and inattention (d = .230) predicted change in parent-reported SCT symptoms. Although not specifically designed to decrease SCT symptoms, the ADHD interventions evaluated in this study resulted in significant improvements in parent-reported SCT with small to moderate effect sizes. Clinical implications and future directions are discussed, including development of interventions for adolescents with high levels of SCT."
245,A,"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with origins early in life. There is growing evidence that individual differences in temperament reactivity are predictive of ADHD symptoms, yet little is known about the relations between temperament reactivity in early infancy and later ADHD symptoms or the combined effect of reactivity with early environmental factors on ADHD symptom development. Using a 9-year prospective longitudinal design, this study tested the independent and interactive contributions of infant reactivity and maternal caregiving behaviors (MCB) on parent- and teacher-reported childhood ADHD symptoms. Participants included 291 children (135 male; 156 female) who participated in a larger study of temperament and social-emotional development. Reactivity was assessed by behavioral observation of negative affect, positive affect, and motor activity during novel stimuli presentations at 4 months of age. MCB were observed during a series of semistructured mother-infant tasks at 9 months of age. Finally, ADHD symptoms were assessed by parent- and teacher-report questionnaires at 7 and 9 years, respectively. Reactivity was predictive of ADHD symptoms, but results were sex specific. For boys, infant motor activity was positively predictive of later ADHD symptoms, but only at lower quality MCB. For girls, infant positive affect was positively predictive of later ADHD symptoms at lower quality MCB, and-unexpectedly-infant positive affect and motor activity were negatively predictive of later ADHD symptoms at higher quality MCB. These results point to early parenting as a moderating factor to mitigate temperament-related risk for later ADHD, suggesting this as a potential intervention target to mitigate risk for ADHD among reactive infants."
246,A,"Previous research has demonstrated a reciprocal relationship between community violence exposure and disruptive behavior problems among youth. No study to date, however, has explored the potential interaction between violence exposure in early adolescence and genetics. We explore the gene x environment interaction's impact on teacher-rated aggressive and impulsive behaviors. Violence exposure during the middle school years was assessed using self-report. Genetic data collection occurred in emerging adulthood. A polygenic score was created using findings from a conduct disorder symptomatology genome-wide association study. Three longitudinal classes of teacher reported aggressive and impulsive behavior were identified. We found a significant relationship between violence exposure and class membership. There was a significant GxE interaction, such that those with below average levels of the polygenic score and who were exposed to violence were more likely to be in the moderately high aggressive and impulsive class as compared to the no to low class. These findings highlight the influence of genetic risk together with violence exposure on adolescent problem behavior. Although youth may have little control over the environments in which they live, interventions can and should focus on helping all youth."
247,A,"Reduced reward responsiveness (RR) may contribute to depression vulnerability. At the neurophysiological level, RR is reliably and validly assessed using the reward positivity (RewP) event-related potential component. We previously identified a blunted RewP in 9-year-old children at high risk for depression due to maternal depression, but the role of RR in pathways from parental history to the development of depressive symptoms has not been examined. At age 9, never-depressed children (N = 369) completed a task in which RewP was measured in response to monetary reward and loss feedback. Parental history of depression was assessed using semistructured interviews, and children reported on their depressive symptoms. At age 12, youth depressive symptoms were reassessed, along with a self-report measure of RR. We tested RR as a moderator of the effects of parental depression on depressive symptoms at age 12, using both neurophysiological and self-report measures and controlling for age 9 symptoms. Main effects of RR and interactions with maternal depression were significant. Maternal depression predicted greater depressive symptoms in youth with blunted and average RewP but was not a significant predictor in youth with an enhanced RewP. A similar pattern was observed for self-reported RR. The two measures of RR were not correlated with each other and accounted for unique variance in symptoms. Interactions between RR and paternal depression were not significant. Reduced RR, as measured by neurophysiology and self-report, moderates the effects of maternal depression on depressive symptoms in offspring. Assessment of RR along with risk factors such as parental depression may aid in identifying children at greatest risk and enhancing RR could be a potential target for prevention. highlight the utility of multimethod approaches for advancing understanding of depression risk."
248,A,"Only one-third of young people who experience suicidal ideation attempt suicide. It is important to identify factors which differentiate those who attempt suicide from those who experience suicidal ideation but do not act on these thoughts. Participants were 4,772 members of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a UK population-based birth cohort. Suicide ideation and attempts were assessed at age 16 years via self-report questionnaire. Multinomial regression was used to examine associations between factors that differentiated adolescents in three groups: no suicidal ideation or attempts, suicidal ideation only and suicide attempts. Analyses were conducted on an imputed data set based on those with complete outcome data (suicidal thoughts and attempts) at age 16 years (N = 4,772). The lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts in the sample was 9.6% and 6.8% respectively. Compared to adolescents who had experienced suicidal ideation, those who attempted suicide were more likely to report exposure to self-harm in others (adjusted OR for family member self-harm: 1.95, for friend self-harm: 2.61 and for both family and friend self-harm: 5.26). They were also more likely to have a psychiatric disorder (adjusted OR for depression: 3.63; adjusted OR for anxiety disorder: 2.20; adjusted OR for behavioural disorder: 2.90). Other risk factors included female gender, lower IQ, higher impulsivity, higher intensity seeking, lower conscientiousness, a greater number of life events, body dissatisfaction, hopelessness, smoking and illicit drug use (excluding cannabis). The extent of exposure to self-harm in others and the presence of psychiatric disorder most clearly differentiate adolescents who attempt suicide from those who only experience suicidal ideation. Further longitudinal research is needed to explore whether these risk factors predict progression from suicidal ideation to attempts over time."
249,A,"It is proposed that some individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) can 'compensate' for their underlying difficulties (e.g. in theory of mind; ToM), thus demonstrating relatively few behavioural symptoms, despite continued core cognitive deficits. The mechanisms underpinning compensation are largely unexplored, as is its potential impact on mental health. This study aimed to estimate compensation patterns in ASD, by contrasting overt social behaviour with ToM task performance, in order to compare the characteristics of 'Low' and 'High' Compensators. A total of 136 autistic adolescents, from the ongoing Social Relationships Study, completed a range of cognitive tasks, the Autistic Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and a self-report anxiety questionnaire. Participants were assigned compensation group status; High Compensators demonstrated good ADOS scores despite poor ToM performance, while Low Compensators demonstrated similarly poor ToM, accompanied by poor ADOS scores. High Compensators demonstrated better IQ and executive function (EF), but greater self-reported anxiety, compared with Low Compensators. Such differences were not found when comparing individuals who had good versus poor ADOS scores, when ToM performance was good. Other core autistic characteristics (weak central coherence, nonsocial symptoms) did not differentiate the High and Low Compensators. IQ, EF and anxiety appear to be implicated in the processes by which certain autistic young people can compensate for their underlying ToM difficulties. This tendency to compensate does not appear to reflect the severity of 'hit' for ASD per se, suggesting that well-compensated individuals are not experiencing a milder form of ASD. The construct of compensation in ASD has implications for research and clinical practice."
250,A,"Adolescent girls who become pregnant demonstrate greater risk for substance use than same-aged peers. However, it remains unclear how risk relates to normative changes in adolescence. Few studies have examined adolescent substance use changes before, during, and after pregnancy and considered how pregnancy outcomes (childbirth, miscarriage, abortion) differentially influence substance use changes. The present study examined associations between different adolescent pregnancy outcomes and within-person changes in substance use from prepregnancy to postpregnancy. Participants included 2,450 girls (52% Black) oversampled from low-income urban neighborhoods in Pittsburgh, PA. Participants self-reported pregnancy outcomes and substance use frequency (alcohol, cigarette, marijuana) annually from ages 11-20. Fixed effects regressions focused on first births, first miscarriages, and first abortions occurring from ages 12-19 to test the associations between pregnancy outcomes and within-individual changes in substance use from prepregnancy to postpregnancy. By design, models controlled for all potential time-stable confounds, and models included age and subsequent pregnancies as time-varying covariates. Consistent with prior studies, girls who became pregnant (20%) reported greater early risk for substance use problems than never-pregnant adolescents, including earlier age of onset and more regular marijuana and cigarette use. Childbirth predicted a 26%-51% within-individual reduction in alcohol, marijuana, and cigarette use that remained significantly lower than prepregnancy levels after childbirth. Alcohol and marijuana use decreased (32%-47%) after miscarriage. Abortion was not associated with long-term changes in substance use; however, marijuana and cigarette use gradually increased (44%-46%) in the years leading up to the year of and after abortion, respectively, before returning to prepregnancy levels. Findings highlight important differences in adolescent substance use patterns based on pregnancy outcome. For pregnant adolescents with heightened pre-existing risk for substance use, pregnancy may be a window of opportunity for substance use screening and behavioral intervention."
251,A,"Self-concept has meaningful relations with psychological functioning and well-being across the life span. Hence, it is important to understand how and when individual differences in multiple domains of self-concept begin to stabilize and whether individual differences remain stable throughout childhood and adolescence and into early adulthood. We assessed individuals' (N = 372) scholastic, social, athletic, and physical appearance self-concepts at five waves over 20 years from age 4 to age 24. In general, stability was large, but medium-sized estimates were obtained for some domains over longer (e.g., 6-year) intervals. Indirect effects from preschool to early adulthood were small, but from age 14 to 24 were medium to large. Stabilities maintained significance independent of family socioeconomic status and global self-worth. Stability estimates were similar for boys and girls except over adolescence for scholastic self-concept, which was more stable for girls than boys. Multiple domains of self-concept constitute stable individual-difference characteristics, independent of global feelings of self-worth. Individuals who have high or low self-concepts early in development tend to maintain their relative standing into early adulthood suggesting points of intervention."
252,A,"Impaired attention to faces of interactive partners is a marker for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in early childhood. However, it is unclear whether children with ASD avoid faces or find them less salient and whether the phenomenon is linked with the presence of eye contact or speech. We investigated the impacts of speech (SP) and direct gaze (DG) on attention to faces in 22-month-old toddlers with ASD (n = 50) and typically developing controls (TD, n = 47) using the Selective Social Attention 2.0 (SSA 2.0) task. The task consisted of four conditions where the presence (+) and absence (-) of DG and SP were systematically manipulated. The severity of autism symptoms, and verbal and nonverbal skills were characterized concurrently with eye tracking at 22.4 (SD = 3.2) months and prospectively at 39.8 (SD = 4.3) months. Toddlers with ASD looked less than TD toddlers at face and mouth regions only when the actress was speaking (direct gaze absence with speech, DG-SP+: d = 0.99, p < .001 for face, d = 0.98, p < .001 for mouth regions; direct gaze present with speech, DG+SP+, d = 1.47, p < .001 for face, d = 1.01, p < .001 for mouth regions). Toddlers with ASD looked less at the eye region only when both gaze and speech cues were present (d = 0.46, p = .03). Salience of the combined DG and SP cues was associated concurrently and prospectively with the severity of autism symptoms, and the association remained significant after controlling for verbal and nonverbal levels. The study links poor attention to faces with limited salience of audiovisual speech and provides no support for the face avoidance hypothesis in the early stages of ASD. These results are consequential for research on early discriminant and predictive biomarkers as well as identification of novel treatment targets."
253,A,"Adolescence is characterized by affective and cognitive changes that increase vulnerability to depression, especially in females. Neurodevelopmental models attribute adolescent depression to abnormal responses in amygdala, striatum, and prefrontal cortex (PFC). We examined whether the strength of functional brain networks involving these regions predicts depression symptoms in adolescent females. In this longitudinal study, we recorded resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) in 174 adolescent females. Using a cross-validation strategy, we related RSFC profiles that included (a) a network consisting of amygdala, striatum, and PFC (within-circuit model), (b) connectivity of this network to the whole brain (extended-circuit model), and (c) a network consisting of the entire brain (whole-brain model) to depression symptoms assessed concurrently and 18 months later. In testing subsets, the within-circuit RSFC profiles were associated with depression symptoms concurrently and 18 months later, while the extended-circuit and whole-brain model did not explain any additional variance in depression symptoms. Connectivity related to anterior cingulate and ventromedial prefrontal cortex contributed most to the association. Our results demonstrate that RSFC-based brain networks that include amygdala, striatum, and PFC are stable neural signatures of concurrent and future depression symptoms, representing a significant step toward identifying the neural mechanism of depression in adolescence."
254,A,"Previous evidence suggests that use of oral contraceptives (OCs), especially during adolescence, may increase women's vulnerability to depression in the short term. Here, we investigate whether women who had first used OC in adolescence show an increased prevalence of depression in the long term. We examined 1,236 women in the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for whom information on depression and age at first OC use was publicly available. We compared women who reported first use of OCs in adolescence to women who had never used OCs and women who had first used OCs in adulthood on 1-year prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) assessed by trained interviewers. Compared with women who had used OCs during adolescence, women who had never used OCs were less likely to meet the criteria for MDD within the past year in adulthood [odds ratio (OR) = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.16-0.60], and so were women who only started using OCs in adulthood (OR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.30-0.95). Third factors that have previously been proposed to explain the relationship between OC use and depression risk such as age at sexual debut, and, importantly, current OC use, did not account for the results in propensity score analyses. We show a long-term association between adolescent OC use and depression risk in adulthood regardless of current OC use. Our findings suggest that adolescence may be a sensitive period during which OC use could increase women's risk for depression, years after first exposure."
255,A,"Maternal and paternal depressive symptoms are related to children's emotional problems, but their combined effect remains unclear. Here, we constructed four parental longitudinal depressive symptom trajectory groups and studied their associations with children's emotional problems at the age of 2 and 5 years. We did an assessment of maternal and paternal depressive symptoms (gestational week 32, as well as 3, 8 and 24 months postnatally) and children's emotional problems at ages two (N = 939) and five (N = 700) in the CHILD-SLEEP cohort. Three separate maternal and paternal depressive symptom trajectories based on latent profile analysis were combined to form four parental depressive symptom trajectory groups. We compared groups with a general linear model, with children's emotional (total, internalizing and externalizing) - problem scores serving as the dependent variables. At both ages, combined parental depressive symptom trajectories were associated with children's emotional problems: effect sizes were medium for total and small for other domains. According to post hoc comparisons, children whose mothers or both parents had persistent depressive symptoms had significantly more total, externalizing and internalizing problems than did children who had neither parent nor only the father showing depressive symptoms. A higher (and persistent) level of maternal depressive symptoms was related to a higher level of these children's emotional problems, a pattern not evident with paternal depressive symptoms. In all analyses, the interaction effect was nonsignificant between parental trajectories and child gender. Findings suggest that an absence of depressive symptoms in their fathers cannot compensate for the adverse effects of maternal depressive symptoms upon their children. Moreover, paternal depressive symptoms alone do not lead to increased risk for emotional problems in these 2- and 5-year-old children. In contrast, even subclinical levels of maternal depressive symptoms in late pregnancy are associated with increased risk for their children's experiencing internalizing and externalizing emotional problems."
256,A,"Anxiety sensitivity, the tendency to fear the symptoms of anxiety, is a key risk factor for the development anxiety disorders. Although obsessive-compulsive disorder was previously classified as an anxiety disorder, the prospective relationship between anxiety sensitivity and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) has been largely overlooked. Furthermore, a lack of genetically informative studies means the aetiology of the link between anxiety sensitivity and OCS remains unclear. Adolescent twins and siblings (N = 1,579) from the G1219 study completed self-report questionnaires two years apart assessing anxiety sensitivity, OCS, anxiety and depression. Linear regression models tested prospective associations between anxiety sensitivity and OCS, with and without adjustment for anxiety and depressive symptoms. A phenotypic cross-lagged model assessed bidirectional influences between anxiety sensitivity and OCS over time, and a genetic version of this model examined the aetiology of these associations. Anxiety sensitivity was prospectively associated with changes in OCS, even after controlling for comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms. The longitudinal relationship between anxiety sensitivity and OCS was bidirectional, and these associations were predominantly accounted for by nonshared environmental influences. Our findings are consistent with the notion that anxiety sensitivity is a risk factor for OCS during adolescence, but also suggest that experiencing OCS confers risk for heightened anxiety sensitivity. The reciprocal links between OCS and anxiety sensitivity over time are likely to be largely mediated by nonshared environmental experiences, as opposed to common genes. Our findings raise the possibility that interventions aimed at ameliorating anxiety sensitivity could reduce risk for OCS, and vice versa."
257,C,"Australian astronomers generate more greenhouse emissions than the average Australian citizen, thereby exacerbating the climate crisis. By quantifying contributions from different activities such as supercomputing and air travel, as presented here, astronomers can focus on reducing emissions by changing their practices in the most critical areas. For astronomers to make a significant contribution to the reduction of climate change-inducing greenhouse gas emissions, we first must quantify the sources of our emissions and review the most effective approaches for reducing them. Here we estimate that Australian astronomers' total greenhouse gas emissions from their regular work activities are greater than or similar to 25 ktCO(2)e yr(-1)(equivalent kilotonnes of carbon dioxide per year). This can be broken into ~15 ktCO(2)e yr(-1)from supercomputer usage, ~4.2 ktCO(2)e yr(-1)from flights (where individuals' flight emissions correlate with seniority), >3.3 ktCO(2)e yr(-1)from the operation of observatories, and 2.6 +/- 0.4 ktCO(2)e yr(-1)from powering office buildings. Split across faculty scientists, postdoctoral researchers and PhD students, this averages to greater than or similar to 37 tCO(2)e yr(-1)per astronomer, more than 40% greater than the average Australian non-dependant's emissions in total, and equivalent to around five times the global average. To combat these environmentally unsustainable practices, we suggest that astronomers should strongly preference the use of supercomputers, observatories and office spaces that are predominantly powered by renewable energy sources. Where current facilities do not meet this requirement, their funders should be lobbied to invest in renewables, such as solar or wind farms. Air travel should also be reduced wherever possible, replaced primarily by video conferencing, which should also promote inclusivity."
258,C,"Far-infrared polarimetric observations reveal a transition parallel to the gas flow in the orientation of magnetic field lines in the Serpens South molecular cloud, allowing gravitational collapse to occur even in the presence of strong magnetic fields. Observations indicate that molecular clouds are strongly magnetized, and that magnetic fields influence the formation of stars. A key observation supporting the conclusion that molecular clouds are significantly magnetized is that the orientation of their internal structure is closely related to that of the magnetic field. At low column densities, the structure aligns parallel with the field, whereas at higher column densities, the gas structure is typically oriented perpendicular to magnetic fields, with a transition at visual extinctionsA(V) greater than or similar to 3 mag. Here we use far-infrared polarimetric observations from the HAWC+ polarimeter on SOFIA to report the discovery of a further transition in relative orientation, that is, a return to parallel alignment atA(V) greater than or similar to 21 mag in parts of the Serpens South cloud. This transition appears to be caused by gas flow and indicates that magnetic supercriticality sets in nearA(V) greater than or similar to 21 mag, allowing gravitational collapse and star cluster formation to occur even in the presence of relatively strong magnetic fields."
259,C,"Microquasars, the local siblings of extragalactic quasars, are binary systems comprising a compact object and a companion star. By accreting matter from their companions, microquasars launch powerful winds and jets, influencing the interstellar environment around them. Steady gamma-ray emission is expected to rise from their central objects, or from interactions between their outflows and the surrounding medium. The latter prediction was recently confirmed with the detection of SS 433 at high (TeV) energies(1). In this report, we analyse more than ten years of gigaelectronvolt gamma-ray data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope on this source. Detailed scrutiny of the data reveal emission in the vicinity of SS 433, co-spatial with a gas enhancement, and hints of emission possibly associated with a terminal lobe of one of the jets. Both gamma-ray excesses are relatively far from the central binary, and the former shows evidence of a periodic variation at the precessional period of SS 433, linking it with the microquasar. This result challenges obvious interpretations and is unexpected from previously published theoretical models. It provides us with a chance to unveil the particle transport from SS 433 and to probe the structure of the magnetic field in its vicinity. Ten years of gamma-ray data reveal emission in the vicinity of the microquasar SS 433 that is co-spatial with an interstellar gas enhancement and varies periodically at the precessional period of SS 433, challenging existing theoretical models."
260,C,"The interaction of a supernova with a circumstellar medium (CSM) can dramatically increase the emitted luminosity by converting kinetic energy to thermal energy. In 'superluminous' supernovae of type IIn-named for narrow hydrogen lines(1) in their spectra-the integrated emission can reach(2-6) similar to 10(51) erg, attainable by thermalizing most of the kinetic energy of a conventional supernova. A few transients in the centres of active galaxies have shown similar spectra and even larger energies(7,8), but are difficult to distinguish from accretion onto the supermassive black hole. Here we present a new event, SN2016aps, offset from the centre of a low-mass galaxy, that radiated greater than or similar to 5 x 10(51) erg, necessitating a hyper-energetic supernova explosion. We find a total (supernova ejecta + CSM) mass likely exceeding 50-100 M-circle dot, with energy greater than or similar to 10(52) erg, consistent with some models of pair-instability supernovae or pulsational pair-instability supernovae-theoretically predicted thermonuclear explosions from helium cores >50 M-circle dot. Independent of the explosion mechanism, this event demonstrates the existence of extremely energetic stellar explosions, detectable at very high redshifts, and provides insight into dense CSM formation in the most massive stars."
261,C,"Statistical analysis of velocity fluctuations in the interstellar medium (ISM) of the Milky Way and NGC 4321 show that the motion of molecular gas over scales ranging from 0.1 to 1,000 pc is similar, and consistent with that generated by a combination of gravity and turbulence. ISM structure at one scale is therefore linked to structure at other scales. The density structure of the interstellar medium determines where stars form and release energy, momentum and heavy elements, driving galaxy evolution(1-4). Density variations are seeded and amplified by gas motion, but the exact nature of this motion is unknown across spatial scales and galactic environments(5). Although dense star-forming gas probably emerges from a combination of instabilities(6,7), convergent flows(8)and turbulence(9), establishing the precise origin is challenging because it requires gas motion to be quantified over many orders of magnitude in spatial scale. Here we measure(10-12)the motion of molecular gas in the Milky Way and in nearby galaxy NGC 4321, assembling observations that span a spatial dynamic range 10(-1)-10(3) pc. We detect ubiquitous velocity fluctuations across all spatial scales and galactic environments. Statistical analysis of these fluctuations indicates how star-forming gas is assembled. We discover oscillatory gas flows with wavelengths ranging from 0.3-400 pc. These flows are coupled to regularly spaced density enhancements that probably form via gravitational instabilities(13,14). We also identify stochastic and scale-free velocity and density fluctuations, consistent with the structure generated in turbulent flows(9). Our results demonstrate that the structure of the interstellar medium cannot be considered in isolation. Instead, its formation and evolution are controlled by nested, interdependent flows of matter covering many orders of magnitude in spatial scale."
262,C,"Evolved stars are foundries of chemical complexity, gas and dust that provide the building blocks of planets and life, and dust nucleation first occurs in their photosphere. The circumstellar regions enveloping these stars, despite their importance, remain hidden to many observations, and dust formation processes are therefore still poorly understood. Laboratory astrophysics provides complementary routes to unveil these chemical processes, but most experiments rely on combustion or plasma decomposition of molecular precursors under physical conditions far removed from those in space. To reproduce and characterize the bottom-up dust formation process, we have built an ultra-high vacuum machine combining atomic gas aggregation with advanced in situ characterization techniques. We show that carbonaceous dust analogues that formed from low-pressure gas-phase condensation of carbon atoms in a hydrogen atmosphere, in a ratio of carbon to molecular hydrogen similar to that reported for evolved stars, lead to the formation of amorphous carbon nanograins and aliphatic carbon clusters. Aromatic species and fullerenes do not form effectively under these conditions, raising implications for a revision of the chemical mechanisms taking place in circumstellar envelopes. Using an atomic gas aggregation process in the laboratory to simulate the conditions in the inner regions of a carbon-rich evolved star, Martinez, Santoro, Merino and colleagues. show that aromatic species and fullerenes form surprisingly inefficiently, and that amorphous carbon nanograins and aliphatic clusters dominate."
263,C,"A large streamer of infalling material joins the dense core with the accretion disk around a young protostar, where the streamer is linked to disk structures. This finding demonstrates the importance of a big-picture viewpoint when studying small-scale accretion features. Binary formation is an important aspect of star formation. One possible route for close-in binary formation is disk fragmentation(1-3). Recent observations show that small-scale asymmetries (<300 au) around young protostars(2,4), although not always resolving the circumbinary disk, are linked to disk phenomena(5,6). In later stages, resolved circumbinary disk observations(7)(<200 au) show similar asymmetries, suggesting that the asymmetries arise from binary-disk interactions(8-10). We observed one of the youngest systems to study the connection between disk and dense core. We find a bright and clear streamer in chemically fresh material (carbon-chain molecular species) that originates from outside the dense core (>10,500 au). This material connects the outer dense core with the region where asymmetries arise near disk scales. This new structure type, ten times larger than those seen near disk scales, suggests a different interpretation of previous observations: large-scale accretion flows funnel material down to disk scales. These results reveal the under-appreciated importance of the local environment on the formation and evolution of disks in early systems(11,12)and a possible initial condition for the formation of annular features in young disks(13,14)."
264,C,"In the standard model of solar flares, a large-scale reconnection current sheet is postulated to be the central engine for powering the flare energy release(1-3)and accelerating particles(4-6). However, where and how the energy release and particle acceleration occur remain unclear owing to the lack of measurements of the magnetic properties of the current sheet. Here we report the measurement of the spatially resolved magnetic field and flare-accelerated relativistic electrons along a current-sheet feature in a solar flare. The measured magnetic field profile shows a local maximum where the reconnecting field lines of opposite polarities closely approach each other, known as the reconnection X point. The measurements also reveal a local minimum near the bottom of the current sheet above the flare loop-top, referred to as a 'magnetic bottle'. This spatial structure agrees with theoretical predictions(1,7)and numerical modelling results. A strong reconnection electric field of about 4,000 V m(-1)is inferred near the X point. This location, however, shows a local depletion of microwave-emitting relativistic electrons. These electrons instead concentrate at or near the magnetic bottle structure, where more than 99% of them reside at each instant. Our observations suggest that the loop-top magnetic bottle is probably the primary site for accelerating and confining the relativistic electrons. Observations of the X8.2 solar flare, which happened on 2017 September 10, could spatially resolve the distribution of the energetic electrons along the reconnection current sheet. More than 99% of them are concentrated at the bottom of the current sheet, not at the reconnection X point."
265,C,"The detection of Lyman continuum emission with a high escape fraction from a low-mass clumpy galaxy atz = 1.42, in a redshift range where previously no similar sources were detected, opens up a new window to constrain the shape of the ionization spectrum. One of the outstanding problems of current observational cosmology is to understand the nature of sources that produced the bulk of the ionizing radiation after the Cosmic Dark Age. Direct detection of these reionization sources(1)is practically infeasible at high redshift (z) due to the steep decline of intergalactic medium transmission(2,3). However, a number of low-zanalogues emitting Lyman continuum at 900 A restframe are now detected atz < 0.4 (refs.(4-8)) and there are also detections in the range 2.5 < z < 3.5 (refs.(9-14)). Here we report the detection of Lyman continuum emission with a high escape fraction (>20%) from a low-mass clumpy galaxy atz = 1.42, in the middle of the redshift range where no detection has been made before and near the peak of the cosmic star-formation history(15). The observation was made in the Hubble Extreme Deep Field(16)by the wide-field Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope(17)onboard AstroSat(18). This detection of extreme ultraviolet radiation from a distant galaxy at a restframe wavelength of 600 A opens up a new window to constrain the shape of the ionization spectrum. Further observations with AstroSat should substantially increase the sample of Lyman-continuum-leaking galaxies at cosmic noon."
266,C,"Galaxy clusters are the most massive collapsed structures in the Universe, with potential wells filled with hot, X-ray-emitting intracluster medium (ICM). Observations, however, show that a substantial number of clusters (the so-called cool-core clusters) also contain large amounts of cold gas in their centres, some of which is in the form of spatially extended filaments spanning scales of tens of kiloparsecs(1,2). These findings have raised questions about the origin of the cold gas, as well as its relationship with the central active galactic nucleus (AGN), whose feedback has been established as a ubiquitous feature in such galaxy clusters(3-5). Here, we report a radiation-hydrodynamic simulation of AGN feedback in a galaxy cluster, in which cold filaments form from the warm, AGN-driven outflows with temperatures between 10(4) and 10(7) K as they rise in the cluster core. Our analysis reveals a new mechanism that, through the combination of radiative cooling and ram pressure, naturally promotes outflows whose cooling times are shorter than their rising times, giving birth to spatially extended cold gas filaments. Our results strongly suggest that the formation of cold gas and AGN feedback in galaxy clusters are inextricably linked and shed light on how AGN feedback couples to the ICM. High-resolution radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy clusters show that extended cold gas filaments can form in the centre of clusters through the combination of radiative cooling and ram pressure from feedback driven by the central active galactic nucleus."
267,C,"In the present-day Universe, magnetic fields pervade galaxy clusters(1) and have strengths of a few microgauss, as measured from Faraday rotation(2). Evidence for cluster magnetic fields is also provided by the observation of megaparsec-scale radio emission, namely radio halos and relics(3). These are commonly found in merging systems(4) and are characterized by a steep radio spectrum S-nu (alpha < -1, where S-nu proportional to nu(alpha) and is nu the observing frequency). It is widely believed that magneto-hydrodynamical turbulence and shock waves (re-)accelerate cosmic rays(5) and produce radio halos and relics. The origin and amplification of magnetic fields in clusters is not well understood. It has been proposed that turbulence drives a small-scale dynamo(6-11) that amplifies seed magnetic fields (which are primordial and/or injected by galactic outflows, such as active galactic nuclei, starbursts or winds(12)). At high redshift, radio halos are expected to be faint, owing to losses from inverse Compton scattering and the dimming effect with distance. Moreover, Faraday rotation measurements are difficult to obtain. If detected, distant radio halos provide an alternative tool to investigate magnetic field amplification. Here, we report Low Frequency Radio Array observations that reveal diffuse radio emission in massive clusters when the Universe was only half of its present age, with a sample occurrence fraction of about 50%. The high radio luminosities indicate that these clusters have similar magnetic field strengths to those in nearby clusters, and suggest that magnetic field amplification is fast during the first phases of cluster formation. LOFAR reveals diffuse radio emission in massive high-redshift clusters, whose high radio luminosities indicate magnetic field strengths similar to those in nearby clusters, suggesting fast magnetic field amplification in the early Universe."
268,C,"Saturn is orbited by dozens of moons, and the intricate dynamics of this complex system provide clues about its formation and evolution. Tidal friction within Saturn causes its moons to migrate outwards, driving them into orbital resonances that pump their eccentricities or inclinations, which in turn leads to tidal heating of the moons. However, in giant planets, the dissipative processes that determine the tidal migration timescale remain poorly understood. Standard theories suggest an orbital expansion rate inversely proportional to the power 11/2 in distance(1), implying negligible migration for outer moons such as Saturn's largest moon, Titan. Here, we use two independent measurements obtained with the Cassini spacecraft to measure Titan's orbital expansion rate. We find that Titan rapidly migrates away from Saturn on a timescale of roughly ten billion years, corresponding to a tidal quality factor of Saturn of Q similar or equal to 100, which is more than a hundred times smaller than most expectations. Our results for Titan and five other moons agree with the predictions of a resonance-locking tidal theory(2), sustained by excitation of inertial waves inside the planet. The associated tidal expansion is only weakly sensitive to orbital distance, motivating a revision of the evolutionary history of Saturn's moon system. In particular, it suggests that Titan formed much closer to Saturn and has migrated outward to its current position. Titan is migrating away from Saturn on a much shorter timescale than expected, lending support to the resonance-locking tidal theory. This result motivates a revision of the evolutionary history of Saturn's moon system and may be relevant to other giant planets."
269,C,"About 1 out of 200 Sun-like stars has a planet with an orbital period shorter than one day: an ultrashort-period planet(1,2). All of the previously known ultrashort-period planets are either hot Jupiters, with sizes above 10 Earth radii (R-circle plus), or apparently rocky planets smaller than 2 R-circle plus. Such lack of planets of intermediate size (the `hot Neptune desert') has been interpreted as the inability of low-mass planets to retain any hydrogen/ helium (H/He) envelope in the face of strong stellar irradiation. Here we report the discovery of an ultrashort-period planet with a radius of 4.6 R-circle plus and a mass of 29 M-circle plus, firmly in the hot Neptune desert. Data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite(3) revealed transits of the bright Sun-like star LTT 9779 every 0.79 days. The planet's mean density is similar to that of Neptune, and according to thermal evolution models, it has a H/He-rich envelope constituting 9.0(-2.9)(+2.7) % of the total mass. With an equilibrium temperature around 2,000 K, it is unclear how this `ultrahot Neptune' managed to retain such an envelope. Follow-up observations of the planet's atmosphere to better understand its origin and physical nature will be facilitated by the star's brightness (V-mag = 9.8)."
270,C,"The initial-final mass relation (IFMR) links the birth mass of a star to the mass of the compact remnant left at its death. While the relevance of the IFMR across astrophysics is universally acknowledged, not all of its fine details have yet been resolved. A new analysis of a few carbon-oxygen white dwarfs in old open clusters of the Milky Way led us to identify a kink in the IFMR, located over a range of initial masses, 1.65 less than or similar to M-i/M-circle dot less than or similar to 2.10. The kink's peak in white dwarf mass of about 0.70-0.75 M(circle dot)is produced by stars withM(i) approximate to 1.8-1.9 M-circle dot, corresponding to ages of about 1.8-1.7 Gyr. Interestingly, this peak coincides with the initial mass limit between low-mass stars that develop a degenerate helium core after central hydrogen exhaustion, and intermediate-mass stars that avoid electron degeneracy. We interpret the IFMR kink as the signature of carbon star formation in the Milky Way. This finding is critical to constraining the evolution and chemical enrichment of low-mass stars, and their impact on the spectrophotometric properties of galaxies. An analysis of the relation between a star's initial mass and its final mass (as a white dwarf) reveals a kink in the initial mass range 1.65-2.10 M-circle dot. This kink appears to correspond to the minimum mass required for carbon star formation in the Milky Way at solar metallicity."
271,C,"The number of small satellites has grown hugely in the past decade, from tens of satellites per year in the mid-2010s to a projection of tens of thousands in orbit by the mid-2020s. This presents both problems and opportunities for observational astronomy. Small satellites offer complementary cost-effective capabilities to both ground-based astronomy and larger space missions. Compared with ground-based astronomy, these advantages are not just in the accessibility of wavelength ranges where the Earth's atmosphere is opaque, but also in stable, high-precision photometry, long-term monitoring and improved areal coverage. Astronomy has a long history of new observational parameter spaces leading to major discoveries. Here we discuss the potential for small satellites to explore new parameter spaces in astrophysics, drawing on examples from current and proposed missions, and spanning a wide range of science goals from binary stars, exoplanets and Solar System science to the early Universe and fundamental physics."
272,C,"A globular cluster-like system in the Galactic bulge hosts two stellar populations with remarkably different ages, identifying it as a site of recent star formation and providing observational proof for the hierarchical assembly of the Milky Way spheroid. The formation and evolutionary processes of galaxy bulges are still unclear, and the presence of young stars in the bulge of the Milky Way is largely debated. We recently demonstrated that Terzan 5, in the Galactic bulge, is a complex stellar system hosting stars with very different ages and a striking chemical similarity to the field population. This indicates that its progenitor was probably one of the giant structures that are thought to generate bulges through coalescence. Here we show that another globular cluster-like system in the bulge (Liller 1) hosts two distinct stellar populations with remarkably different ages: only 1-3 Gyr for the youngest, and 12 Gyr for the oldest, which is impressively similar to the old component of Terzan 5. This discovery classifies Liller 1 and Terzan 5 as sites of recent star formation in the Galactic bulge and provides clear observational proof that the hierarchical assembly of primordial massive structures contributed to the formation of the Milky Way spheroid."
273,C,"In the optical sky, minutes-duration transients from cosmological distances are rare. Known objects that give rise to such transients include gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), the most luminous explosions in the Universe(1) that have been detected at redshifts as high as z approximate to 9.4 (refs. (2-4)). These high-redshift GRBs and their associated emission can be used to probe the star formation and reionization history in the era of cosmic dawn. Here, we report a near-infrared transient with an observed duration shorter than 245 s that is coincident with the luminous star-forming galaxy GN-z11 at z approximate to 11. The telluric absorption shown in the near-infrared spectrum indicates that its origin is above the Earth's atmosphere. We can rule out the possibility of known man-made objects or moving objects in the Solar System on the basis of the observational information and our current understanding of the properties of these objects. As some long-duration GRBs are associated with a bright ultraviolet or optical flash(5-14), we investigate the possibility that the detected signal arose from a rest-frame ultraviolet flash associated with a long GRB from GN-z11. Despite the very low probability of being a GRB, we find that the spectrum, brightness and duration of the transient are consistent with such an interpretation. Our result may suggest that long GRBs can be produced as early as 420 million years after the Big Bang. A peculiar near-infrared transient with an observed duration shorter than 245 s, coincident with the luminous star-forming galaxy GN-z11 at z approximate to 11, might have arisen from a rest-frame ultraviolet flash associated with a long gamma-ray burst in GN-z11."
274,F,"The current trend of business model research shows an increased endeavour of conceptualizing business frameworks for circular economy (CE). While previous sustainability paradigms have failed to attract market stakeholders, their reaction differ regarding this concept The reason is discovering that the benefits of former industrial systems have turned to be threats for modern companies. Thus, a circular transition seems beneficial not only in environmental but also in financial dimensions. Closing material and energy flows results in reduced costs and enables businesses to propose novel values to customers. The present study aims to investigate the current stage of circular transformation on a corporate level. In order to do that, it thoroughly analyses the business model evolution of an innovative and knowledge-intensive industry, biotechnology. The research employs a circular evaluation method to detect which parts of the applied business structures show the signs of transition. The findings indicate that the business innovation process in the sector is in line with the disciplines of CE. However, this phenomenon is rather the result of striving for market competitiveness, than making efforts for sustainable development. It proves the emergence of CE to be as much an economic concern as it is an environmental one."
275,F,"This paper examines the dynamics between growth and profitability in an economic crisis context by considering the endogeneity of this relationship. It also analyzes the role of innovation and export intensity in the growth-profit relationship. Using a large firm-level dataset comprising Spanish manufacturing companies during the pre-crisis (2000-2007) and the crisis (2008 2014) period, static and dynamic panel data models are estimated. The analysis suggests the following results. First, in the short term, growth has a positive impact on profits, while the effect of profits on growth depends on the measure of growth used. So, employee's growth requires previous profit but profit does not play a major role as determinant of sales growth. Second, profit rates are found to persist in the short term. In contrast, a reversion of turnover and employees growth rates is observed. Thirdly, the moderation analysis applied shows that the strategy that has enabled firms to grow is export. Moreover, the influence of the export intensity on profitability in the economic crisis period is obtained indirectly through sales and employee's growth. Unlike expected, innovation efforts do not moderate the relationship between profitability and firm growth."
276,F,"The aim of this paper is to assess the fair marketability discount (MD) in the Spanish market for valuation multiples comparing public versus private transactions. The study finds that to obtain MD it is necessary previously to control by a battery of factors that affects ratios' prices such as industry, firm size, profitability, risk, year and also other characteristics about the buyer. The interactions of MD with each variable showed different investors' perceptions about non marketability enterprises explaining MD. The valuation methodology applied in the research was a cross section of 824 public and private acquisitions in the Spanish market from the period 2006-2017. This work represents important evidence, in a more integrated vision than previous literature, for analysts and regulators stressing the necessity to apply MD in Spanish valuation processes based in listed multiples."
277,F,"The paper aims at exploring the antecedents of customers' online purchase intention and behaviour, and at uncovering sources of heterogeneity. A sample of customers was surveyed to measure perceived risk and benefits, trust, online purchase intention and behaviour. The study confirmed the causal chain of perceived risks-trust-perceived benefits-online purchase intention-actual purchase. A Finite Mixture Partial Least Squares (FIMIX-PLS) was performed to uncover sources of heterogeneity. It found that the level of security of the payment methods is relevant to understand the relationship between purchase intention and behaviour, while the level of previous experience with the online medium clarifies the relationship between perceived risk and trust. The study contributes to understanding the antecedents of online purchase intention and their relationship with actual purchase behaviour. Additionally, it offers evidence of heterogeneity in the proposed causal relations, particularly, concerning the level of trust in the payment methods and the level of Internet experience."
278,F,"The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of the standardization of the new product development (NPD) process on its efficiency. A dilemma exists with regard to determining to what extent NPD processes should be standardized, in order to not hinder the operators during the performance of NPD process and consequently, weaken it. The case analysis for this study was carried out at a company whose process development has been standardized for a decade and has undergone several degrees of standardization. Quantitative and qualitative research methods were applied in the study. A regression method was used for quantitative research in order to study the effects of selected dependent and independent variables; using qualitative analysis, we supported the findings of the quantitative analysis. The results of the analysis indicate that the standardization of the NPD process does have an impact on its efficiency. From the obtained results, it may also be concluded that a very high degree of standardization begins to reduce the efficiency of the NPD process."
279,F,"Forecasting the stock returns in the emerging markets is challenging due to their peculiar characteristics. These markets exhibit linear as well as nonlinear features and Conventional forecasting methods partially succeed in dealing with the nonlinear nature of stock returns. Contrarily, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) is a flexible machine learning tool which caters both the linear and nonlinear markets. This paper investigates the forecasting ability of ANN by using Fama and French five-factor model. We construct ANN'S based on the composite factors of the FF5F model to predict portfolio returns in two stages; in stage one, the study identifies the best-fit combination of training, testing, and validation along with the number of neurons full sample period. In stage two, the study uses this best combination to forecast the model under 48-months rolling window analysis. In-sample and out-sample comparisons, regression, and goodness of fit test and actual and predicted values of the stock returns of our ANN model reveal that the proposed model accurately predicts the one-month ahead returns. Our findings reinforce the investment concept that the markets compensate the high-risk portfolios more than mid and low beta portfolios and the methodology will significantly improve the return on investment of the investors."
280,F,"A skilled, competent, and motivated nursing workforce is crucial for a well-functioning health care system. Nurses' professional activities done on a regular basis, their workload, and occupancy are related to the patient's health status, dependence level and care needs. Therefore, managing human resources in nursing by effectively distributing nurses' working time and monitoring their workload for safe and high quality care, managers should rely on the severity of patients' health status and their independence level. In this article the results on how nurses' working time depends on patients' independence are provided. The research was carried out at a regional hospital, in departments of medical profile. The time-and-motion study was implemented with 72 observations made in total, which amounted to 777.2 hours of nursing time. A questionnaire was used to assess the level of patients' independence by assessing the four activities of the patient's daily living. The results revealed that the largest amount of nurses' working time, i.e. almost half of a day shift, was spent on direct patient care by administrating medication use and performing various nursing procedures. Nurses would spend almost half of the time for direct patient care on completely dependent patients, while one third would be spent on dependent patients. The relative number of nurses' contacts with a patient is directly proportional to patient's level of independence; a strong or fairly strong linear relationship was established between the level of patients' independence and the relative amount of nurses' working time."
281,F,"The relationship between advertising effectiveness and behavioural intentions is assessed when involvement with the product is introduced as a direct covariant effect, rather than as a moderator. Advertising effectiveness is assessed through attitude towards the ad and advertising cognition. Advertising media type combined with age is tested as a moderating variable (younger/digital vs. older/traditional). With a sample of n = 307 consumers, a structural statistical path model is implemented to empirically test the hypotheses. It is found that involvement has an effect on attitude towards the ad and on ad cognition. Thus, it is established that the ad cognition variable, rather than attitude towards the ad, has a strong statistical effect on behavioural intentions. The model suggests that the level of the consumer's attention to the ad depends on her/his degree of involvement with the product. Also, the evidence tends to indicate that the cognitive process through which the consumer builds purchase intentions is similar in both communication channels irrespective of age difference."
282,F,"Many real-world problems in the financial sector have to consider different objectives which are conflicting, for example portfolio selection. Markowitz proposed an approach to determine the optimal composition of a portfolio analysing the trade-off between return and risk. Nevertheless, this approach has been criticized for unrealistic assumptions and several changes have been proposed to incorporate investors' constraints and more realistic risk measures. In this line of research, our proposal extends the mean-semivariance portfolio selection model to a multiobjective credibilistic model that besides risk and return, also considers the price-to-earnings ratio to measure portfolio performance. Uncertain future returns and PER ratio of each asset are approximated using L-R power fuzzy numbers. Furthermore, we consider budget, bound and cardinality constraints. To solve the constrained portfolio optimization problem, we use the algorithm NSGA-II. We assess the proposed approach generating a portfolio with shares included in the Latin American Integrated Market. Results show that this new approach is a good alternative to solve the portfolio selection problem when multiple objectives are considered."
283,F,"This paper compares how Czech and Slovak microentrepreneurs perceive the volume and ease of access to finance that they face. Having an adequate number of sources of finance and easier access to them can help improve both enterprise and country performance. Chi-square and Z score tests for population proportions were used to test hypotheses. 740 microenterprises from Czech Republic and 287 microenterprises from Slovakia were included for the analyses that were performed by this study. The results show that Czech microentrepreneurs feel they have more sources of finance and have easier access to them than their Slovak counterparts. These differences may in part be linked to other factors such as the experience and age of microentrepreneurs and micro-firms, amount of business loans and microfinancing organizations, credit interest rates and credit rejection rates, the relative degree of economic freedom, the volume of government guarantees, relative GDP levels, the quality of business environment and ease of doing business. Additionally, The Moran's I spatial autocorrelation index was performed to evaluate influence of location on the perception of Czech and Slovak microenterprises that were located in different regions of both countries. The paper also discusses the results' policy implications for governments and financial institutions."
284,F,"In the age of globalisation, implementation and commercialisation of new technologies are perceived as key elements determining competitiveness of particular countries, therefore, the growth of innovativeness is seen as the predominant direction of European Union society's transformation into information society. The aim of the paper is to propose a procedure of measurement of innovativeness growth over time, with the Summary Innovation Index (SII) methodology as a starting point. 'Ihe considered issue can be expressed by the following main question: how to measure the innovation performance dynamics for a selected group of countries (such as the EU-28, EU-15 or EU-13 countries) and for time intervals (not only for two moments of observations). This is an important inquiry since well-known innovativeness indices (SII, GII, or IOI) concentrate mainly on the provision of information about countries' innovation performance for a specific year of observations. Due to this fact, changes occurring over longer time periods are rather neglected. The main result of the paper is a proposition of average innovativeness growth index. The index uses weights describing the employment share of a selected group of specialists (e.g.: scientists and engineers, research and development personnel) in relation to the economically active population."
285,F,Studies on the finance-growth link use different proxy variables for financial development. Among the most used is the total credit share in the GDP. Previous empirical studies show to be sensitive to the choice of the finance proxy indicator. Total credit share in the GDP appears biased in empirical modeling. Credit structure (loans to firms and households) prove to be more robust when used in the modeling. Credit structure reveals a different impact on economic growth showing lending policy impact varies depending on the credit structure. Researchers studying the finance-growth link must account for this when investigating supply leading and demand-following theories. Policymakers should also take care of the credit structure since loans to household discourage growth in the long run and are sensitive to economic shocks. We find empirical evidence to support both supply leading and demand- following theory. Bi-directional causality between private loans to firms/households and economic growth exists using Granger causality test. Private loans to firms and households economic growth exists using Granger causality test. Private loans to firms and households have a positive impact on economic growth in Croatia.
286,F,"After integrating external ecological and endogenous factors of the development of the industry, the paper builds a financing ecology index system, and analyses the financing ecology of strategic emerging industries in recent years. Then the paper further analyses the influence of external and internal financing ecology on financing efficiency. The results show that the financing ecology of the strategic emerging industries, external financing ecology in particular, is in the continuous improvement. The financing efficiency is significantly positively correlated with the macro-economy level and the internal financing ecology, and significantly negatively correlated with the role of government. There is a positive but non-significant correlation between financial development and financing efficiency, meanwhile a negative and non-significant correlation between credit environment and financing efficiency. The internal and external financing ecology can be replaced to some extent. Therefore, the strategic emerging industries should give full consideration to the synergistic optimization of the endogenous factors and external financing ecology so as to improve the financing efficiency."
287,F,"Based on knowledge-based theory of organizational capabilities and dynamic capabilities theory, this paper tries to establish the linkages between tacit knowledge resources, its integration into firm level capabilities, product innovation and firm performance. In this way, the paper analyses the relationships between some of the most relevant variables to the organizations in order to remain competitive. The conceptual model is tested using a sample of organizations in the industrial sector, using SEM and hierarchical regression analysis. Results show a positive relationship between tacit knowledge and firm performance, tacit knowledge and product innovation, and product innovation and firm performance. A partial mediating effect of product innovation on the tacit knowledge firm performance relationship is established. Also, technical capabilities have a moderator effect on tacit knowledge firm performance relationship. At the end of the paper managerial implications are commented, as well directions for future studies."
288,F,"The main aim of this study is to explore the linkages between innovation capacity, business sophistication, and macroeconomic stability within OECD countries. In order to obtain information regarding the relationship between time series variables, the Pedroni cointegration, Kao cointegration, fully modified ordinary least square, dynamic ordinary least square, Granger causality, and Dumitrescu Hurlin causality tests are employed. The empirical results reveal that improvement in business sophistication triggers innovation capacity and support macroeconomic stability. Innovation capacity would also need to be expanded in the long-run, which positively leads to advanced business sophistication that has a cyclical effect If policymakers intend to accelerate business sophistication, then their attention should be directed towards maximizing the economic indicators in the long-run. To the best of our knowledge, the linkage between innovation capacity, business sophistication and macroeconomic stability in OECD countries has not been comprehensively explored through the use of a single dataset. Thus, the findings of this study could lead to a new debate regarding the concept."
289,F,"The selection of a suitable customer lifetime value (CLV) model is a key issue for companies that are introducing a CLV managerial approach in their online B2C relationship stores. The online retail environment places CLV models on several specific assumptions, e.g. non-contractual relationship, continuous purchase anytime, variable-spending environment. The article focuses on empirical statistical analysis and predictive abilities of selected probabilistic CLV models that show very good results in an online retail environment compared to different model families. For comparison, eleven CLV models were selected. The comparison has been made to the online stores' datasets from Central and Eastern Europe with annual revenues of hundreds of millions of euros and with almost 2.3 million customers. Probabilistic models have achieved overall good and consistent results on the majority of the studied transactional datasets, with BG/NBD and Pareto/NBD models that can be considered stable with significant lifts from the baseline Status quo model. Abe's variant of Pareto/NBD have underperformed multiple criterions and would not be fully useful for the studied datasets without further improvements. In the end, the authors discuss the deployment implications of selected CLV models and propose further issues for future research to address."
290,F,"Bank risk capital (capital at risk) is identified with the value of banks' own funds maintaining to absorb potential losses and protect against insolvency. It is calculated for the capital adequacy ratios, recommended by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. On other words, it is a kind of banks' capital that financing securing the negative effects of risk occurring. A comparative analysis of effectiveness of bank risk capital in the Visegrad Group countries, constituting the main objective of the study, results from the needs indicated in the already conducted preliminary research. In the article, statistical and econometric methods were used, based on linear regression models. The conducted research were aimed to verify the research hypothesis stating that in the analyzed banking sectors of the Visegrad Group countries there is a positive correlation between banks' profitability and a level of their bank risk capital. The study indicated that net profit of the analyzed banking sectors increases with a growth of total own funds, while profitability is diversified in individual countries. Declining operational efficiency results from the growing cost of obtaining and maintaining risk capital."
291,F,"In response to a greater environmental awareness, organizations are concerned more and more about the """"greening"""" human resource management (GHRM). Although the literature on GHRM has been extending, published studies have paid little attention to the research of GHRM and its contribution to employee commitment towards the environment, especially the interactions of GHRM practices, so far. Thus, to bridge this research gap, this study extends the Ability-Motivation-Opportunity and the Social exchange theories in the green context by investigating a new conceptual framework, which explores the indirect and interactive effects of GHRM practices (training, reward, and organizational culture) on employee environmental commitment. A quantitative study is conducted through a survey involving 209 respondents. Findings suggest that: (1) three GHRM practices are important tools in stimulating directly employees to commit to the environmental activities, (2) a two-way interaction of green training and green organizational culture can unlock employee commitment for the environment, especially at the high and average levels of green organizational culture, (3) the commitment is also increased significantly through a three-way interaction, the two strongest effects are recognized with the conditions of high-green organizational culture and the average-and high-green reward, whereas (4) the interacting between green training and green reward is an unimportant factor in encouraging employee environmental attachment."
292,F,"This study provides a dynamic analysis of the lead-lag relationship between sovereign Credit Default Swap (CDS) and bond spreads of the highly indebted southern European countries, considering an extensive time sample from the period before the global financial crisis to the latest developments of the sovereign indebtedness in the euro area. We employ an integrated price discovery methodology on a rolling sample, with the intention of investigating the efficient pricing of credit risk in the CDS and bond markets and the possibility of CDS spreads causing rises in bond spreads. In addition, we attempt to depict the evolution of the price discovery process regarding the direction of influence from one market to the other. The rolling window analysis verifies that the price discovery process evolves over time, presenting frequent alternations concerning the leading market. We find that during periods of economic turbulence the CDS market leads the bond market in price discovery, incorporating the new information about sovereign credit risk faster and more efficiently than the bond market does. This regularity should be seriously considered by private and public participants as they make investment and funding decisions. Therefore, the motivation of our paper is to identify the dominant market in terms of price discovery during a period of economic turmoil and, thus, to provide insights for decision making to investment bodies and central governments."
293,G,"Objectives: The objective of this study was to identify important gaps in the public health evidence base and consider the implications of these for public health and public health economics. Study design: This was a review and critique of public health policy in the UK. Methods: Using two key psychological concepts relating to cognitive biases, viz. cognitive dissonance and heuristics, the shortcomings in public health approaches to confronting the prevalence of non-communicable diseases are described. The implications are drawn out. Results: Two cognitive biases in public health thinking are identified. (i) A dissonance between what is known and what is done, resulting in the repetition of solutions that have previously been shown to have had little or no effect. (ii) The habitual use of set of heuristics which mean that simple solutions to complex problems are preferred to undertaking the detailed assessment of how to bring about change. These biases mean that the evidence about the dynamics of populations and the ways that the mechanisms of prevention actually operate seldom feature in the way interventions, policy and practice are undertaken. The evidence base is consequently highly skewed. Conclusions: Health economics combined with sociological reasoning has potentially an important role to play in developing the ideas that will overcome the problems attaching to the cognitive biases.

It also estimates medical expenditure savings because of the reduction of NCD burden. Study design: A microsimulation model is used to predict the future health and economic outcomes in France. Methods: A 'RF targets' scenario, assuming the achievement of the six targets on RFs by 2025, is compared to a counterfactual scenario with respect to disability-adjusted life years and healthcare costs differences. Results: The achievement of the RFs targets by 2025 would save about 25,300 (and 75,500) life years in good health in the population aged 25-64 (respectively 65+) years on average every year and would help to reduce healthcare costs by about (sic)660 million on average per year, which represents 0.35% of the current annual healthcare spending in France. Such a reduction in RFs (net of the natural decreasing trend in mortality) would contribute to achieving about half of the 2030 NCD premature mortality target in France. Conclusions: The achievement of the RF targets would lead France to save life years and life years in good health in both working-age and retired people and would modestly reduce healthcare expenditures. To achieve RFs targets and to curb the growing burden of NCDs, France has to strengthen existing and implement new policy interventions. (c) 2019 The Royal Society for Public Health.

295,G,"Introduction: Non-communicable diseases strongly linked to lifestyle factors create an increasing burden of disease. Fiscal interventions (tax and subsidy) are one approach to improving lifestyles, but their effective design might be improved. Economic framework: Conventional economic theory suggests that fiscal interventions are only used to correct prices for externalities (costs or benefits imposed on others). These can be difficult to calculate accurately. Fiscal interventions operate by altering the prices that consumers face. Price increases are predicted to reduce demand, and the size of the effect is measured by the price elasticity. Tax changes may not translate directly into price changes, however. Evidence for the effect of taxes, subsidies and prices: There is strong evidence for the effectiveness of taxation in relation to reducing tobacco and alcohol consumption and resulting harms. There has been less evaluation of taxation in relation to other unhealthy behaviors or of subsidies to promote healthy behaviors. Discussion: Fiscal levers have been used as interventions to improve health rather than for market correction. Taking account of behavioral insights may improve the design of fiscal interventions and combining interventions may increase effectiveness. Conclusion: Both types of intervention have a role in improving health, but there may be challenges in promoting uptake of healthy behaviors. (c) 2019 The Royal Society for Public Health.

296,G,"Objectives: Research into the socio-economic patterning of health and social care costs in the UK has so far been limited to examining only particular aspects of healthcare. In this study, we explore the social gradients in overall healthcare and social care costs, as well as in the disaggregated costs by cost category. Study design: We calculated the social gradient in health and social care costs by cost category using a linked electronic health record data set for Kent, a county in South East England. We performed a cross-sectional analysis on a sample of 323,401 residents in Kent older than 55 years to assess the impact of neighbourhood deprivation on mean annual per capita costs in 2016/17. Methods: Patient-level costs were estimated from activity data for the financial year 2016/17 andwere extracted alongside key patient characteristics. Mean costs were calculated for each area deprivation quintile based on the index of multiple deprivation of the neighbourhood (lower super output area) in which the patient lived. Cost subcategories were analysed across primary care, secondary care, social care, community care and mental health. Results: The mean annual per capita cost increased with deprivation across each deprivation quintile, with a cost of 1205 pound in the most affluent quintile, compared with 1623 pound in the most deprived quintile, a 35% cost increase. Social gradients were found across all cost subcategories. Conclusions: Health inequalities in the population older than 55 years in Kent are associated with health and social care costs of 109m pound, equivalent to 15% of the estimated total expenditure in this age group. Such significant costs suggest that appropriate interventions to reduce socioeconomic inequalities have the potential to substantially improve population health and, depending on how much investment they require, may even result in cost savings.

297,G,"Objectives: In an effort to provide recommendation for maximizing synergy between maternal, infant, and young children's nutrition and family planning in India, this study makes a comprehensive assessment of the effects of the planning of births in terms of timing, spacing and limiting childbearing on maternal and child health outcomes. Study design: This study used the latest National Family Health Survey data of India that is globally known as the Demographic and Health Survey. A robust two-stage systematic random sampling was used for selecting representative samples for measuring demographic and health indicators. Methods: Maternal and child health outcomes are measured by body mass index (grouped as normal, underweight, and overweight) and anemia for mothers, and stunting, underweight, anemia, and under-five mortality for the children. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models were applied. Results: Women with a higher number of births and among those with first-order births with fewer than 2 years between marriage and first birth, the risk of being underweight and having anemia was significantly higher compared with their counterparts. In addition, the probability of being underweight and risk of stunting, anemia, and mortality was higher among the children from women with a higher number of births and with fewer than 3 years of spacing between births than that of their counterparts. Conclusions: The findings from this study support the importance of birth planning in improving maternal, child health, and nutritional outcomes. The proper planning of births could help to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal-3 of good health and well-being for all by 2030 in India, where a significant proportion of women still participate in early marriages, early childbearing, and a large number of births with close spacing.

298,G,"Objectives: Over a quarter of UK births are to women who were born outside of the UK. Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) women are disproportionately affected by poor mental health and inequitable access to mental health care in the perinatal period, yet the influence of the migrant status (mother's UK vs. non-UK birth) is poorly understood. This study aimed to explore the relationship between ethnicity, migration and mental health indicators among mothers participating in a large nationally representative cohort study. Study design: This is a secondary analysis of data from the Millennium Cohort Study. Methods: Logistic regression quantified the crude and adjusted effects of self-reported ethnicity and migrant status on prevalence of psychological distress and treatment for Ethnicity anxiety/depression at 9-month and 5-year postpartum. Results: We found substantial variation in the prevalence of distress according to ethnicity and migrant status, with Indian and Pakistani women at greatest risk. Despite equal or greater risk, BME and migrant women were less likely to report treatment for anxiety/depression. Mutually adjusted analyses showed ethnicity to be a stronger predictor of both outcomes than migrant status; however, at 5 years, being a migrant independently predicted lower odds of treatment, for a statistically similar level of distress. Conclusions: Migrant women are likely to be at high risk of poor mental health in the perinatal period and beyond, yet may face significant barriers to accessing mental health care. A better understanding of ethnicity and migration as interrelated risk factors for perinatal mental ill-health is needed to help National Health Service organisations develop policy and practice that is flexible and responsive to diversity.

299,G,"Objectives: National vaccination coverage in Sweden is high. Recurrent outbreaks of measles and rubella however highlight some immunity gaps in the population. Current knowledge about immunization status of undocumented migrant children is scant. The World Health Organization/Europe has developed the Guide to Tailoring Immunization Programmes (TIP) to assist countries in diagnosing barriers and motivators to vaccination in communities with low vaccination coverage. Based on the TIP guide, the objective of this study was to explore determinants to vaccination among undocumented immigrants, using qualitative approach. Study design: The study consisted of three steps: (i) an initial workshop for problem statement; (ii) qualitative research for increased understanding of the vaccination practices of children in the undocumented community; and (iii) a second workshop to incorporate the qualitative interview findings together with data from key stakeholders into a conceptual framework. Methods: This was a qualitative study featuring interviews of seven undocumented parents recruited at non-governmental clinics, three nurses at Child Health Centers, and information from key stakeholders retrieved at workshops as part of the TIP process. Results: The content analysis revealed two main themes: parental fear of being questioned and parental acceptance of child immunization. Undocumented parents had a positive view and attitude toward childhood immunization but expressed strong fear of being asked for identification papers at healthcare facilities. Owing to lack of knowledge on entitlements of the undocumented among health personnel, parents were incorrectly rejected when seeking care for their children. Frequent mobility among undocumented may limit access to complete the immunization schedule. Undocumented parents mistrust healthcare providers and avoid health facilities, further delaying childrens' access to health care, including immunization services. Conclusions: The findings of this study confirm the complexity of barriers that undocumented parents face regarding childhood immunization. The TIP guide offers a valuable process for a deeper understanding of the determinants of immunization challenges among undocumented migrants. (C) 2019 The Authors.

300,G,"Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a print-based intervention supported by Internet tools at improving physical activity in cancer survivors compared with a standard letter recommendation. Prediagnosis physical activity and self-efficacy were hypothesised to predict physical activity improvement. Study design: Waiting list randomised control trial and cost-consequence analysis. Methods: Adult cancer survivors who could become physically active without prior medical approval were randomised to receive either a print-based intervention supported by Internet tools (intervention, n = 104) or a standard letter recommendation (control, n = 103). Physical activity was assessed at 12 weeks with maintenance assessed at 24 weeks in the intervention arm. The number needed to treat was calculated, and a cost-consequence analysis completed. Results: Participants in receipt of a print-based intervention supported by Internet tools improved their physical activity by 36.9% over 12 weeks compared with 9.1% in the control arm. Physical activity was maintained at 24 weeks in the intervention arm. A total of 6.29 cancer survivors needed to receive the intervention for one cancer survivor to improve their physical activity over a standard letter recommendation. Intervention delivery cost 8.19 pound per person. Prediagnosis physical activity and self-efficacy did not predict physical activity improvement. Conclusion: A print-based intervention supported by Internet tools offers a promising low-cost means to intervene to improve physical activity in cancer survivors. (C) 2019 The Authors.

301,G,"Objective: The objective of this study was to explore the perspectives of stakeholders on public-private partnership (PPP) in healthcare service delivery in Sindh province of Pakistan including the reasons for adopting such policies and the barriers for its implementation. Study design: This was a qualitative primary study. Methods: Semistructured in-depth interviews were conducted with 13 stakeholders, including officials from provincial government and district administration (legislators, district managers, deputy commissioners and assistant commissioners) and representatives from private sector organisations with direct or indirect role in implementation of PPP policy, selected using purposive sampling methods. Data were analysed using a thematic approach. Results: Participants had very limited in-depth understanding about the concept of PPP. They considered multifaceted corruption in the health system and the success of existing PPP initiatives as the main reasons for the PPP policy adoption. Resistance from healthcare staff was perceived as the main barrier for implementation of PPP. There was a common perception that better monitoring capacity in the private sector management can be a cause of concern for public sector employees who may have become used to less efficient working. A common theme found in the narratives was the possible apprehensions from healthcare staff about the loss of their jobs. Conclusion: Our findings indicated lack of effective engagement with key stakeholders and the resistance from healthcare staff as the key barriers for PPP implementation in Sindh, Pakistan. These findings provide useful insights for the successful implementation of such initiatives in Pakistan as well as in other similar settings. (C) 2019 The Royal Society for Public Health.

302,G,"Objectives: The aim was to investigate the association between baseline marital status and mortality using survival (Cox-regression) analysis. Study design: This is a prospective cohort study. Methods: The public health survey by Scania in 2008 was linked to the Swedish cause of death register. This prospective cohort study includes 12,245 men and 14,969 women aged 18-80 years, and 538 men and 362 women of them died during the 5.3-year follow-up. Results: Unmarried, divorced, and widowed men had significantly higher hazard rate ratios (HRRs) of all-cause mortality than married/cohabitating men. For women, the HRRs of these groups did not significantly differ from those of the married/cohabitating reference group.

303,G,"Objectives: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection continues to be a major public health concern in China. There is little information available in the literature about age- and sex-specific HCV incidence trends. The goal of this study was to examine recent trends in HCV incidence rates in Hunan, China, according to age and gender. Study design: A descriptive study was implemented with a joinpoint analysis. Methods: Based on the annual reported incidence data of hepatitis C in Hunan, China, from 2004 to 2017, we performed a joinpoint regression analysis to examine trends in the annual percentage change (APC) and the average annual percentage change (AAPC) in the incidence of HCV infection throughout the study period; we stratified the analysis by gender and age. The software calculates the APC, AAPC and the 95% confidence intervals for each trend segment and tests whether the slope for each segment has a significant difference from the prior segment using a Z test. Results: From 2004 to 2017, the overall incidence rate of HCV infection rose from 0.93 per 100,000 to 20.88 per 100,000 (AAPC, 25.2%). In particular, women aged >= 65 years had the fastest increasing rate (AAPC, 29.9%). The incidence of different demographic groups showed no significant difference in increasing trends before 2013. However, new patterns emerged after 2013: the incidence of people aged 0-14 years was no longer significantly elevated; a significant yearly decline occurred in the incidence of HCV in people aged 15-29 years; the incidence of HCV in people aged >= 30 years continued to increase, with significantly slower increasing rates than before; and women aged >= 65 years showed a significantly higher yearly increase in incidence than that in men in the same age group (APC, 11.1% in women versus 5.3% in men). Conclusion: The overall increasing rate of HCV infection significantly slowed after 2007 and 2013. The differences in incidence trends among demographic groups have obviously increased in the last 5 years, and the reasons underlying these different trends urgently require further study. People in older age groups, especially women aged >= 65 years, still experienced increases in incidence rates in the last 5 years. This finding indicates that programmes for the prevention and control of HCV infection in older people require continued strengthening. (C) 2019 The Authors.

304,G,"Objective: We aimed to evaluate the level of knowledge of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) among Hajj pilgrims before and after an education health programme during international vaccine consultations in France. Study design: A cross-sectional study was performed in the consultation for travel medicine and international vaccination in Reims University Hospital between July 2014 and October 2015. Methods: Consecutive adults (>18 years old) who attended for pre-Hajj meningococcal vaccination were eligible to complete an anonymous questionnaire with closed answers to evaluate their level of knowledge about MERS-CoV. To evaluate the effectiveness of the information given during the consultation, the same questionnaire was completed by the Hajj pilgrim before and after the consultation, where the information about MERS-CoV was provided. Results: Among 82 Hajj pilgrim adults enrolled in the study, less than 25% were aware of the routes of transmission, symptoms and preventive behaviours to adopt abroad or in case of fever. Pilgrims had a higher rate of correct responses on each question at the time they completed the second questionnaire, as compared with the first, with 11 of 13 questions answered significantly better after delivery of educational information about MERS-CoV. However, although the rate of correct answers to the questions about routes of transmission, symptoms, preventive behaviours to adopt in case of fever and time delay between return and potential MERS-CoV occurrence increased significantly after receiving the information, the rates remained below 50%. Conclusion: Information given during travel consultations significantly increases the general level of knowledge, but not enough to achieve epidemic control.

305,G,"Objectives: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic that emerged in December 2019 has rapidly evolved in recent months to become a worldwide and ongoing pandemic. Shortage of medical masks remains an unresolved problem. This study aims to investigate the filtration efficiency (FE) of home-made masks that could be used as alternatives for community mitigation of COVID- 19. Study design: Experimental observational analytic study. Methods: The FE of home-made masks and medical masks (as the control) were tested under laminar flow within a scaled air duct system using nebulised NaCl aerosols sized 6-220 nm. The size-resolved NaCl aerosol count was measured using a scanning mobility particle-sizer spectrometer. Home-made masks with an external plastic face shield also underwent a splash test. In addition, the fibre structures of medical masks were studied under an electron microscope after treatment with either 75% alcohol or soap and water at 60 degrees C. Results: The FE of the home-made masks at 6-200 nm were non-inferior to that of medical masks (84.54% vs 86.94%, P = 0.102). Both types of masks achieved an FE of 90% at 6-89 nm. A significantly higher FE was achieved when one piece of tissue paper was added adjacent to the inner surface of the medical mask than medical mask alone (6-200 nm: 91.64% vs 86.94%, P < 0.0001; 6-89 nm: 94.27% vs 90.54%, P < 0.0001; 90-200 nm: 82.69% vs 73.81%, P < 0.0001). The plastic face shield prevented the home-made mask from fluid splash. The fibre structures of the external surface of medical masks were damaged after treatment with either 75% alcohol or soap and water at 60 degrees C. Conclusions: The home-made masks in this study, which were made of one piece of tissue paper and two pieces of kitchen towels, layered from face to external, had an FE at 6-200 nm non-inferior to that of medical mask materials, which had a certified FE of >= 95% at 3 mm. In the current COVID-19 pandemic with the shortage of medical masks, these home-made masks combined with an external plastic shield could be used as an alternative to medical masks for community mitigation. In addition, one piece of tissue paper could be placed adjacent to the inner surface of a medical mask to prolong effective lifespan of the medical mask. These demand reduction strategies could be used to reserve medical masks for use in healthcare and certain high-risk community settings, such as symptomatic persons, caregivers and attendees to healthcare institutions.

306,G,"Objectives: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan city, China, which has subsequently led to a global pandemic. At the time of writing, COVID-19 in Wuhan appears to be in the final phase and under control. However, many other countries, especially the US, Italy and Spain, are still in the early phases and dealing with increasing cases every day. Therefore, this article aims to summarise and share the experience of controlling the spread of COVID-19 in Wuhan and provide effective suggestions to enable other countries to save lives. Study design: Data from the National Health Commission of China are used to investigate the evolution trajectory of COVID-19 in Wuhan and discuss the impacts of the intervention strategies. Methods: A four-stage modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model is presented. This model considers many influencing factors, including chunyun (the Spring festival), sealing off the city and constructing the Fangcang shelter hospitals. In addition, a novel method is proposed to address the abnormal data on 12-13 February as a result of changing diagnostic criteria. Four different scenarios are considered to capture different intervention measures in practice. The exposed population in Wuhan who moved out before sealing off the city have also been identified, and an analysis on where they had gone was performed using the Baidu Migration Index. Results: The results demonstrate that the four-stage model was effective in forecasting the peak, size and duration of COVID-19. We found that the combined intervention measures are the only effective way to control the spread and not a single one of them can be omitted. We estimate that England will be another epicentre owing to its incorrect response at the initial stages of COVID-19. Fortunately, big data technology can help provide early warnings to new areas of the pandemic. Conclusions: The four-stage SEIR model was effective in capturing the evolution trajectory of COVID-19. Based on the model analysis, several effective suggestions are proposed to prevent and control the pandemic for countries that are still in the initial phases.

307,G,"Objectives: The US has among the world's strictest automobile emission standards, but it is now loosening them. It is unclear where a nation should draw the line between the associated cost burden imposed by regulations and the broader societal benefits associated with having cleaner air. Our study examines the health benefits and cost-effectiveness of introducing stricter vehicle emission standards in France and Italy. Study design: Quasi-experimental study. Methods: We used cost-effectiveness modeling to measure the incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and cost (Euros) of adopting more stringent US vehicle emission standards for PM2.5 in France and Italy. Results: Adopting Obama era US vehicle emission standards would likely save money and lives for both the French and Italian populations. In France, adopting US emission standards would save (sic)1000 and increase QALYs by 0.04 per capita. In Italy, the stricter standards would save (sic)3000 and increase QALYs by 0.31. The results remain robust in both the sensitivity analysis and probabilistic Monte Carlo simulation model. Conclusions: Adopting more stringent emission standards in France and Italy would save money and lives. (C) 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
308,G,"Background: In the context of major exposure to medical-based ionizing radiation (IR), French health institutions agree that adopting a precautionary approach is essential. A number of scientific studies have highlighted the risk of developing breast cancer after exposure to IR, even from low doses. However, the information circulating on the subject is varied. Objectives: A study of the mainstream press was performed to better understand the elements constituting women's representations of IR in mammography for breast cancer screening. Study design: The data used came from a corpus created with the mainstream press database 'Europresse.' The keyword 'mammography' was chosen. The software package Iramuteq was used to perform a statistical analysis of textual data using the Reinert method. Results: This study highlights a paradox between the social principle of prevention and the discourse elements on mammography screening present in the mainstream press. Conclusion: The general French press does not take into account radiation protection in cancer screening discourses. A greater effort to provide information on this subject is needed.

309,G,"Objectives: The Japanese prime minister declared a state of emergency on April 7 2020 to combat the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This declaration was unique in the sense that it was essentially driven by the voluntary restraint of the residents. We examined the change of the infection route by investigating contact experiences with COVID-19-positive cases. Study design: This study is a population-level questionnaire-based study using a social networking service (SNS). Methods: To assess the impact of the declaration, this study used population-level questionnaire data collected from an SNS with 121,375 respondents (between March 27 and May 5) to assess the change in transmission routes over the study period, which was measured by investigating the association between COVID-19-related symptoms and (self-reported) contact with COVID-19-infected individuals. Results: The results of this study show that the declaration prevented infections in the workplace, but increased domestic infections as people stayed at home. However, after April 24, workplace infections started to increase again, driven by the increase in community-acquired infections. Conclusions: While careful interpretation is necessary because our data are self-reported from voluntary SNS users, these findings indicate the impact of the declaration on the change in transmission routes of COVID-19 over time in Japan.

310,G,"Objectives: The emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and subsequent pandemic has led to the most substantive large-scale, open, and public social discussion of epidemiology and science in recent history. In the United States (US), extensive debate has ensued as to the risk posed by the disease, whether the health system is prepared to manage a high volume of critical cases, whether any number of public health responses are necessary and appropriate, and the appropriate ways to prevent, manage, and treat the pandemic. I hypothesized that the interplay between scientists, policymakers, and the public in an open forum was associated with increased overall public trust in science and scientists, but that this was moderated by political orientation and/or religious commitment. In the context of a public health emergency, it is important to understand the degree to which science and scientists are trusted to produce information that can provide reassurance and also can explain the details of a highly complex event such as a viral pandemic while providing actionable recommendations. Study design: The study design was analytic cross-sectional. Methods: Data were obtained on March 17-18, 2020, from a sample of 242 US-based Amazon Mechanical Turk users. Respondents completed a 49-question survey consisting of key sociodemographic variables, political affiliation, religious commitment, and two iterations of the Trust in Science and Scientist Inventory (one for March 2020, and one for December 2019 using retrospective recall). Changes in mean level of trust and interaction with political affiliation and/or religious commitment were assessed using mixed ANOVA via the general linear model. Results: On a scale from 1 (low trust) to 5 (high trust), the mean level of trust in science and scientists was static; 3.82 in December 2019 and 3.81 in March 2020. Conservative political orientation and high religious commitment were associated with significantly less overall trust in science; the interaction effect suggested that liberal trust in science decreased slightly from December 2019 to March 2020, whereas conservative trust increased slightly. Conclusions: Counter to my expectations, the overall level of trust in science remained static after the first several months of COVID-19 in the US, although there is some evidence that political orientation was associated with magnitude and directionality of change in trust. Continued examination of these trends is important for understanding public response to epidemiologic recommendations. (C) 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

311,G,"Objectives: The objectives of the study were to investigate access to free school meals (FSMs) among eligible children, to describe factors associated with uptake and to investigate whether receiving FSMs was associated with measures of food insecurity in the UK using the Coronavirus (COVID-19) wave of the UK Household Longitudinal Study. Study design: The study design was cross-sectional analyses of questionnaire data collected in April 2020. Methods: Six hundred and thirty-five children who were FSM eligible with complete data were included in the analytic sample. Accessing a FSM was defined as receiving a FSM voucher or a cooked meal at school. Multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate (i) associations between characteristics and access to FSMs and (ii) associations between access to FSMs and household food insecurity measures. All analyses accounted for survey design and sample weights to ensure representativeness. Results: Fifty-one percent of eligible children accessed a FSM. Children in junior schools or above (aged 8+ years) (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 11.81; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.54, 25.19), who belonged to low-income families (AOR: 4.81; 95% CI: 2.10, 11.03) or still attending schools (AOR: 5.87; 95% CI: 1.70, 20.25) were more likely to receive FSMs. Children in Wales were less likely to access FSMs than those in England (AOR: 0.11; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.43). Receiving a FSM was associated with increased odds of recently using a food bank but not reporting feeling hungry. Conclusions: In the month after the COVID-19 lockdown, 49% of eligible children did not receive any form of FSMs. The present analyses highlight that the voucher scheme did not adequately serve children who could not attend school during the lockdown. Moreover, more needs to be done to support families relying on income-related benefits, who still report needing to access a food bank. As the scheme may be continued in summer or in a potential second wave, large improvements will be needed to improve its reach. (c) 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health.

312,G,"Background: There are concerns internationally that lockdown measures taken during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic could lead to a rise in loneliness. As loneliness is recognised as a major public health concern, it is therefore vital that research considers the impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic on loneliness to provide necessary support. But it remains unclear, who is lonely in lockdown? Methods: This study compared sociodemographic predictors of loneliness before and during the COVID-19 pandemic using cross-cohort analyses of data from UK adults captured before the pandemic (UK Household Longitudinal Study, n = 31,064) and during the pandemic (UCL (University College London) COVID-19 Social Study, n = 60,341). Results: Risk factors for loneliness were near identical before and during the pandemic. Young adults, women, people with lower education or income, the economically inactive, people living alone and urban residents had a higher risk of being lonely. Some people who were already at risk of being lonely (e.g. young adults aged 18-30 years, people with low household income and adults living alone) experienced a heightened risk during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with people living before COVID-19 emerged. Furthermore, being a student emerged as a higher risk factor during lockdown than usual. Conclusions: Findings suggest that interventions to reduce or prevent loneliness during COVID-19 should be targeted at those sociodemographic groups already identified as high risk in previous research. These groups are likely not just to experience loneliness during the pandemic but potentially to have an even higher risk than normal of experiencing loneliness relative to low-risk groups.

313,G,"Objectives: We aim to advance productive collaborations between public health and political science by highlighting key challenges to an effective partnership between these fields and examining the opportunities that exist to overcome them. Study design: This short communication takes a descriptive analytical approach. Methods: We synthesize conceptual insights drawn from (1) a recent international workshop that brought together researchers at the intersection of public health and political science and (2) the emerging literature on 'public health political science.' Results: Although public health and political science would appear to be natural partners, work typically occurs in parallel rather than in partnership, resulting in missed opportunities for productive collaboration. We identify three key challenges to an effective partnership between political science and public health. These include the need for a common language and shared understanding of key concepts; mutual recognition of the complexity and diversity within each field; and a deeper engagement with their conceptual and methodological complementarities and differences. We also identify the area of evidence-informed policymaking as particularly ripe for productive collaboration between public health and political science. Conclusions: As the roles of politics and scientific evidence in public health policy grow ever more contentious, public health and political science need to move beyond their disciplinary comfort zones and engage productively with the different perspectives and contributions that each field has to offer.

314,G,"Objectives: Lockdown measures in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic can have serious mental health effects on the population, especially in vulnerable groups, such as those living in poor socio-economic conditions, those who are homeless, migrant workers and asylum seekers/refugees. In addition, these vulnerable groups frequently have greater difficulty accessing health services and in treatment adherence. The aim of this study is to estimate the impact of the COVID-19-related lockdown on service utilisation and follow-up adherence in an Italian mental health outpatient service for migrants and individuals in socio-economic difficulties. Study design: The design of this study is a retrospective cross-sectional study. Methods: All patients who visited the mental health outpatient service in the months of February and March in the years 2017-2020 were included in the study. To compare service utilisation before and after the lockdown, the number of patients who visited the mental health outpatient service for psychiatric interview were recorded. Follow-up adherence was calculated as the percentage of patients who visited in February and subsequently attended a follow-up visit in March of the same year. Results: The number of patients who visited the outpatient service between February 2017 and February 2020 was continuously increasing. In March 2020, fewer patients visited the service for psychiatric interview, in line with the introduction of lockdown measures. In addition, the number of the patients who visited in February 2020 and returned for their follow-up visits in March 2020 declined from approximately 30% over the same months in 2017-2019 to 17.53% in March 2020. Conclusions: The lockdown-related reduction in numbers of patients accessing the mental health service makes it difficult to help vulnerable populations during a period of time in which their mental health needs are expected to increase. Moreover, the reduction seen in follow-up compliance increases the risk of treatment discontinuation and possible relapse. Proactive alternative strategies need to be developed to reach these vulnerable populations. (c) 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
315,G,"Objectives: For a large part of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, Singapore had managed to keep local cases in the single digits daily, with decisive measures. Yet, we saw this critical time point when the imported cases surged through our borders. The gaps which we can and have efficiently closed, using a public health approach and global border containment strategies, are aptly illustrated through this case. This critical point of imported case surge has resulted in a large spike of daily local cases sustained through community transmission, up to 120/day within a very short time frame. We were able to rapidly bring this under control. Study design: This is a case study of a patient who passed through our borders, with COVID-19 masquerading as a resolved sore throat. Methods: The events were prospectively documented. Results: We present a case of a 21-year-old student returning from Nottingham. He presented with sore throat as the only symptom the few days prior his return, and on arrival at our border (day 7 from initial symptoms), his sore throat had already resolved. The events leading up to his COVID-19 diagnosis highlight the gaps of the international screening processes at the global border entry and the potential consequences of community chain transmission through imported COVID-19 cases. Conclusions: An important global border control measure to implement quickly will be to expand the symptom list to isolated sore throat and/or a prior history of recent symptoms (resolved). This may capture a larger proportion of imported cases at border entry point for more effective containment. This piece will be equally relevant to the general physicians, emergency care physicians, otolaryngologists and anaesthetists, who are at higher risk of encountering a throat visualization during intubation and routine examination. This information can be useful to countries with low resources or insufficient COVID-19 testing kits. (c) 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
316,G,"Objectives: The aim of the study was to model dementia prevalence and outcomes within an ageing population using a novel hybrid simulation model that simultaneously takes population-level and patient-level perspectives to better inform dementia care service planning, taking into account severity progression variability. Study design: This is a simulation study. Methods: We developed a hybrid computer simulation combining different methods to best represent population and individual dementia dynamics. Individual patient outcomes are aggregated into three progression rate types to report the effects of severity progression variability and intervention benefits. Results: Fast progression of dementia severity is associated with higher annual care cost and short overall survival duration. Those patients are more likely to develop moderate to severe symptoms more quickly, highlighting a need for more urgent provision of appropriate care services. Slower severity progression is associated with lower annual care costs, but longer survival requires higher overall financial provision. Although lifestyle interventions reduce overall care costs, treatment and lifestyle intervention benefits are modest at the population level. Conclusions: Individual variation of dementia decline is an important factor to include in planning adequate levels of care services and to ensure timely and appropriate service availability. Hybrid simulation models provide useful insights at the population and individual level, supporting effective decision-making. (c) 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

317,A,"Previous studies have shown that poor family environments are related to more sleep problems; however, little is known about how family irregularity in early life affects the development of sleep problems over childhood using objective sleep measures. The current study tests the hypothesis that early family irregularity contributes to the development of sleep problems. This population-based study comprises 5,443 children from the Generation R Study. Family irregularity was measured with seven maternal-reported questions on family routines when children were 2 and 4 years old. Mothers reported on sleep problems at child age 3, 6, and 10 years, whereas children completed questionnaires on sleep problems at age 10. Additionally, we used tri-axial wrist accelerometers for five nights in 851 children (mean age 11.7 years) to assess sleep objectively. Family irregularity was associated with more mother- and child-reported sleep problems at ages 3, 6, and 10 years as well as with a shorter sleep duration and later objective sleep onset, but not with sleep efficiency or waking time. The association between family irregularity and multi-informant subjective sleep problems at age 10 years was mediated by mother-reported child psychopathology at age 6 years. Our findings show a long-term robust association of preschool family irregularity with more sleep problems during childhood as well as shorter sleep duration and later sleep onset as measured objectively with actigraphy. In part, these sleep problems were associated with family irregularity by way of child psychopathology. These findings suggest that interventions improving preschool family irregularity, which are targeted to reduce child psychopathology, may also impact the development of sleep problems beneficially."
318,C,"Astronomers have a long tradition of outreach to satisfy public enthusiasm about stars and the Universe. Anecdotal evidence shows that astronomers love to popularize(1), and their efforts reach millions around the world(2,3). Yet no systematic comparisons of these activities may be performed without robust evidence. The general literature on scientists' outreach finds barriers that discourage outreach, such as lack of fun, time, skills or recognition, or the perception that it lies outside of the professional role(4) and is a risk to reputation-the 'Carl Sagan effect'. It also finds that outreach is generally more frequent among the most senior and academically productive male scientists(5-7). Here, we present a study of n = 2,587 members of the International Astronomical Union with a 30% response rate. This is the largest systematic study of astronomers' outreach activities beyond local case studies(8-10), which reveals how these factors compare within this community and in different research systems and environments. We show regional variations of outreach activity, with higher activity among astronomers in South America and Africa, and find that personal factors are important, yet contextual factors matter too. Among astronomers, gender, rewards and fear of peer criticism do not matter. Future research should focus on explanatory factors inherent to the ecology of scientific work, to better understand what drives scientists within their specific cultural and research environments."
319,A,"Children with neurodevelopmental disorders are at increased risk of developing depression. Irritability predicts depression in the general population and is common in children with neurodevelopmental disorders. Thus, it is possible that irritability in children with neurodevelopmental disorders contributes to the link with later depression. This study aimed to (a) examine the association between childhood neurodevelopmental difficulties and adolescent depression and (b) test whether irritability explains this association. Children with any neurodevelopmental difficulty at the age of 7-9 (n = 1,697) and a selected, comparison group without any neurodevelopmental difficulty (n = 3,177) were identified from a prospective, UK population-based cohort, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Neurodevelopmental difficulties were defined as a score in the bottom 5% of the sample on at least one measure of cognitive ability, communication, autism spectrum symptoms, attention-deficit/hyperactivity symptoms, reading or motor coordination. The Development and Well-Being Assessment measured parent-reported child irritability at the age of 7, parent-reported adolescent depression at the age of 10 and 13, and self-reported depression at the age of 15. Depression measures were combined, deriving an outcome of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adolescence. Logistic regression examined the association between childhood neurodevelopmental difficulties and adolescent MDD, controlling for gender. Path analysis estimated the proportion of this association explained by irritability. Analyses were repeated for individual neurodevelopmental problems. Childhood neurodevelopmental difficulties were associated with adolescent MDD (OR = 2.11, 95% CI = 1.24, 3.60, p = .006). Childhood irritability statistically accounted for 42% of this association. On examining each neurodevelopmental difficulty separately, autistic, communication and ADHD problems were each associated with depression, with irritability explaining 29%-51% of these links. Childhood irritability appears to be a key contributor to the link between childhood neurodevelopmental difficulties and adolescent MDD. High rates of irritability in children with autistic and ADHD difficulties may explain elevated rates of depression in the neurodevelopmental group."
320,A,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common reaction to trauma in children and adolescents. While a significant minority of trauma-exposed youth go on to have persistent PTSD, many youths who initially have a severe traumatic stress response undergo natural recovery. The present study investigated the role of cognitive processes in shaping the early reactions of child and adolescents to traumatic stressors, and the transition to persistent clinically significant post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). A prospective longitudinal study of youth aged 8-17 years who had attended a hospital emergency department following single trauma was undertaken, with assessments performed at 2-4 weeks (N = 226) and 2 months (N = 208) post-trauma. Acute stress disorder and PTSD were assessed using a structured interview, while PTSS, depression severity and peritraumatic and post-traumatic cognitive processes were assessed using self-report questionnaires. On the basis of their PTSS scores at each assessment, participants were categorised as being on a resilient, recovery or persistent trajectory. PTSS decreased between the two assessments. Cognitive processes at the 2- to 4-week assessment accounted for the most variance in PTSS at both the initial and follow-up assessment. The onset of post-traumatic stress was associated particularly with peritraumatic subjective threat, data-driven processing and pain. Its maintenance was associated with greater peritraumatic dissociation and panic, and post-traumatic persistent dissociation, trauma memory quality, rumination and negative appraisals. Efforts to deliberately process the trauma were more common in youth who experienced the onset of clinically significant PTSS. Regression modelling indicated that the predictive effect of baseline negative appraisals remained when also accounting for baseline PTSS and depression. Cognitive processes play an important role in the onset and maintenance of PTSS in children and adolescents exposed to trauma. Trauma-related appraisals play a particular role when considering whether youth make the transition from clinically significant acute PTSS to persistent PTSS."
321,A,"Retrospective and cross-sectional studies often report associations between childhood gender nonconformity and greater emotional and peer difficulties. This study used the ALSPAC birth cohort to investigate relationships between childhood gender-typed behavior and peer and emotional problems throughout childhood and adolescence. A total of 11,192 participants had at least one measure of parent-rated gender-typed behavior in infancy; 7,049 participants had a measure of child-rated gender-typed behavior at 8.5 years. Separate linear mixed regression models were fitted to assess whether parent-rated and child-rated gender-typed behaviors were associated with emotional and peer problems across childhood and adolescence (6-16 years old). The effect of adding covariates (self-esteem, abuse, bullying, feeling accepted by peers, and feeling different) on these relationships was assessed. For boys, more gender-nonconforming behavior was associated with greater subsequent emotional and peer problems in childhood and adolescence. Adjusting for self-esteem, relational bullying victimization, feeling different, or feeling accepted by peers reduced some of these associations. In contrast, for girls, more gender-nonconforming behavior was associated with fewer emotional problems in childhood and adolescence. In girls, self-reported gender-nonconforming behavior was also associated with fewer parent-rated peer problems but parent-rated gender-nonconforming behavior was associated with more parent-rated peer problems; this latter association was partly explained by self-esteem, bullying, and abuse victimization. These associations were statistically significant but small. Overall, more female-typical behaviors were generally associated with greater subsequent emotional and peer problems, for both boys and girls. Future studies should investigate factors that reduced these associations, as well as potential negative effects of female-typical behaviors or advantages of male-typical ones. As this was a 14-year longitudinal study, the relationships between gender-role behaviors and emotional/peer problems warrant further research despite the small association sizes."
322,A,"The co-occurrence of internalizing disorders is a common form of psychiatric comorbidity, raising questions about the boundaries between these diagnostic categories. We employ network psychometrics in order to: (a) determine whether internalizing symptoms cluster in a manner reflecting DSM diagnostic criteria, (b) gauge how distinct these diagnostic clusters are and (c) examine whether this network structure changes from childhood to early and then late adolescence. Method Symptom-level data were obtained for service users in publicly funded mental health services in England between 2011 and 2015 (N = 37,162). A symptom network (i.e. Gaussian graphical model) was estimated, and a community detection algorithm was used to explore the clustering of symptoms. The estimated network was densely connected and characterized by a multitude of weak associations between symptoms. Six communities of symptoms were identified; however, they were weakly demarcated. Two of these communities corresponded to social phobia and panic disorder, and four did not clearly correspond with DSM diagnostic categories. The network structure was largely consistent by sex and across three age groups (8-11, 12-14 and 15-18 years). Symptom connectivity in the two older age groups was significantly greater compared to the youngest group and there were differences in centrality across the age groups, highlighting the age-specific relevance of certain symptoms. These findings clearly demonstrate the interconnected nature of internalizing symptoms, challenging the view that such pathology takes the form of distinct disorders."
323,A,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by impaired cognitive and social skills, including emotional dysregulation, and symptoms have been suspected to partly arise from impaired formation of memory representations regulating these behaviours. Sleep, which is subjectively impaired in ASD, is critical for forming long-term memories and abstracted gist-based representations. We expected a generally reduced memory benefit from sleep in children with ASD, and a diminished enhancement of gist representations, in particular. We compared effects of sleep on memory consolidation between boys (9-12 years) with ASD (n = 21) and typically developing (TD, n = 20) boys, matched for age and IQ, in a within-subjects crossover design. We employed an emotional picture recognition task and the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) word list task for assessing gist memory formation in the emotional and nonemotional domain, respectively. Learning took place before retention intervals of nocturnal sleep and daytime wakefulness, and retrieval was tested afterwards. Surprisingly, on the DRM task, children with ASD showed an enhanced sleep-dependent formation of gist-based memory (i.e. more recall of 'critical lure words' after sleep compared to wakefulness) than TD children, with this effect occurring on top of a diminished veridical word memory. On the picture recognition task, children with ASD also showed a stronger emotional enhancement in memory (i.e. relatively better memory for negative than neutral pictures) than TD children, with this enhancement occurring independent of sleep. Sleep polysomnography was remarkably comparable between groups. Children with ASD show well-preserved sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Enhanced gist memory formation in these children might reflect a compensatory response for impairments at earlier stages of memory processing, that is during encoding."
324,A,"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with working memory (WM) deficits. However, WM is a multiprocess construct that can be impaired through several pathways, leaving the source of WM impairments in ADHD unresolved. In this study, we aim to replicate, in an independent sample, previously reported deficits in component processes of WM deficits in ADHD and expand to consider their implications for neurocognitive outcomes. In 119 children (7-14 years old, 85 with ADHD), we used electroencephalography measures to quantify component processes during performance of a spatial working memory task. We quantified stimulus encoding using alpha range (8-12 Hz) power; vigilance by the P2 event-related potential to cues; and WMmaintenance by occipital-alpha and frontal-theta (4-7 Hz) power. These measures were evaluated against metrics of executive function, ADHD symptoms, and academic achievement. Encoding alpha-power decreases and cue P2 amplitude were attenuated in ADHD, whereas occipital-alpha power during maintenance was significantly greater in ADHD, consistent with a compensatory response to weak encoding. Weak alpha modulation during encoding was associated with poorer reading comprehension and executive function, as well as enhanced ADHD symptoms. Previously reported effects in frontal-theta power failed to replicate. Stimulus encoding, a component process of WM coupled to alpha modulation, is impaired in ADHD, and, unlike WM maintenance or vigilance processes, has implications outside of the laboratory via a relationship with executive function, and, to a weaker extent, reading comprehension."
325,A,"The incidence of adolescent suicide is rising in the United States, yet we have limited information regarding short-term prediction of suicide attempts. Our aim was to identify predictors of suicide attempts within 3-months of an emergency department (ED) visit. Adolescents, ages 12-17, seeking health care at 13 pediatric EDs (Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network) and one Indian Health Service Hospital in the United States were consecutively recruited. Among 10,664 approached patients, 6,448 (60%) were enrolled and completed a suicide risk survey. A subset of participants (n = 2,897) was assigned to a 3-month telephone follow-up, and 2,104 participants completed this follow-up (73% retention). Our primary outcome was a suicide attempt between the ED visit and 3-month follow-up. One hundred four adolescents (4.9%) made a suicide attempt between enrollment and 3-month follow-up. A large number of baseline predictors of suicide attempt were identified in bivariate analyses. The final multivariable model for the full sample included the presence of suicidal ideation during the past week, lifetime severity of suicidal ideation, lifetime history of suicidal behavior, and school connectedness. For the subgroup of adolescents who did not report recent suicidal ideation at baseline, the final model included only lifetime severity of suicidal ideation and social connectedness. Among males, the final model included only lifetime severity of suicidal ideation and past week suicidal ideation. For females, the final model included past week suicidal ideation, lifetime severity of suicidal ideation, number of past-year nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) incidents, and social connectedness. indicate that the key risk factors for adolescent suicide attempts differ for subgroups of adolescents defined by sex and whether or not they report recent suicidal thoughts. also point to the importance of school and social connectedness as protective factors against suicide attempts."
326,A,"Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents. The purpose of this study was to test a family-focused outpatient cognitive behavioral treatment (F-CBT) protocol for depressed adolescents following psychiatric hospitalization for a suicide attempt or suicidal ideation, and who had a co-occurring risk factor (suicidal behavior prior to the index admission, nonsuicidal self-injury, and/or a substance use disorder), in a randomized Phase 2 efficacy trial. Method One hundred forty-seven adolescents (mean age = 14.91 years; 76.2% female, 85.5% White) and their families, recruited primarily from an inpatient psychiatric hospitalization program, were randomly assigned to F-CBT or enhanced treatment-as-usual (E-TAU). A suicide attempt was the primary outcome variable. Depression, suicidal ideation, and nonsuicidal self-injury are also reported here. Assessments were completed at pretreatment as well as 6, 12, and 18-months postrandomization (Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01732601). In the sample as a whole, rates of attempts decreased from 20% at 6 months to 9% at 12 months to 7% at 18 months. There was no evidence of a significant difference between treatment arms in rates of suicide attempts, major depressive disorder, suicidal ideation, or nonsuicidal self-injury at any of the postrandomization assessment points. Though F-CBT was associated with reductions in suicidality, depression, and nonsuicidal self-injury, E-TAU showed an equally strong effect. Greater frequency of F-CBT treatment sessions, particularly at the start of care, and alternative approaches to transitioning to care at 12 months, may be necessary when using F-CBT with this population."
327,C,"Light bosons, proposed as a possible solution to various problems in fundamental physics and cosmology(1-3), include a broad class of candidates for physics beyond the standard model, such as dilatons and modulis(4), wave dark matters(5) and axion-like particles(6). If light bosons exist in nature, they will spontaneously form 'clouds' by extracting rotational energy from rotating massive black holes through superradiance, a classical wave amplification process that has been studied for decades(7,8). The superradiant growth of the cloud sets the geometry of the final black hole, and the black hole geometry determines the shape of the clouds(9-11). Hence, both the black hole geometry and the cloud encode information about the light boson. For this reason, measurements of the gravitational field of the black hole/cloud system (as encoded in gravitational waves) are over-determined. We show that a single gravitational-wave measurement can be used to verify the existence of light bosons by model selection, rule out alternative explanations for the signal, and measure the boson mass. Such measurements can be done generically for bosons in the mass range [10(-16.5),10(-14)] eV using observations of extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) by the forthcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA)."
328,A,"Very preterm (VPT; <30 weeks gestation) children are a heterogeneous group, yet the co-occurrence of psychiatric and neurodevelopmental impairments remains unclear. Moreover, the clinical and socio-environmental factors that promote resilient developmental outcomes among VPT children are poorly understood. One hundred and twenty five children (85 VPT and 40 full-term) underwent neurodevelopmental evaluation at age 5-years. Parents and teachers completed measures of internalizing, externalizing, attention-deficit/hyperactivity (ADHD), and autism symptoms. Psychiatric and neurodevelopmental measures were analyzed using Latent Profile Analysis. Multinomial regression examined the extent that infant, sociodemographic, and family factors, collected prospectively from birth to follow-up, independently differentiated resilient and impaired children. Four latent profiles were identified, including a Typically Developing Group which represented 27.1% of the VPT group and 65.0% of the full-term group, an At-Risk Group with mild psychiatric and neurodevelopmental problems (VPT 44.7%, full-term 22.5%), a Psychiatric Group with moderate-to-severe psychiatric ratings (VPT 12.9%, full-term 10.0%), and a school-based Inattentive/Hyperactive Group (VPT 15.3%, full-term 2.5%). Clinical diagnoses were highest among the Psychiatric Group (80%). Factors that differentiated resilient and impaired subgroups of VPT children included prolonged exposure to maternal psychosocial distress (p <= .04), current family dysfunction (p <= .05), and maternal ADHD symptoms (p <= .02), whereas social risk index scores differentiated resilient and impaired full-term children (p < .03). Lower levels of maternal distress, family dysfunction, and maternal ADHD symptoms were associated with resilience among VPT children. Maternal distress and family dysfunction are modifiable factors to be targeted as part of psychiatric interventions embedded in the long-term care of VPT children."
329,A,"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is associated with altered global and local visual processing. However, the nature of these alterations remains controversial, with contradictory findings and notions ranging from a reduced drive to integrate information into a coherent 'gestalt' (""""weak central coherence"""" = WCC) to an enhanced perceptual functioning (EPF) in local processing. This study assessed the association between autism and global/local visual processing, using a large sample of monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins (N = 290, 48% females, age = 8-31 years). The Fragmented Pictures Test (FPT) assessed global processing, whereas local processing was estimated with the Embedded Figures Test (EFT) and the Block Design Test (BDT). Autism was assessed both categorically (clinical diagnosis), and dimensionally (autistic traits). Associations between visual tasks and autism were estimated both across the cohort and within-twin pairs where all factors shared between twins are implicitly controlled. Clinical diagnosis and autistic traits predicted a need for more visual information for gestalt processing in the FPT across the cohort. For clinical diagnosis, this association remained within-pairs and at trend-level even within MZ twin pairs alone. ASD and higher autistic traits predicted lower EFT and BDT performance across the cohort, but these associations were lost within-pairs. In line with the WCC account, our findings indicate an association between autism and reduced global visual processing in children, adolescents and young adults (but no evidence for EPF). Observing a similar association within MZ twins suggests a non-shared environmental contribution."
330,A,"Vocabulary is crucial for an array of life outcomes and is frequently impaired in developmental disorders. Notably, 'poor comprehenders' (children with reading comprehension deficits but intact word reading) often have vocabulary deficits, but underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Prior research suggests intact encoding but difficulties consolidating new word knowledge. We test the hypothesis that poor comprehenders' sleep-associated vocabulary consolidation is compromised by their impoverished lexical-semantic knowledge. Memory for new words was tracked across wake and sleep to assess encoding and consolidation in 8-to-12-year-old good and poor comprehenders. Each child participated in two sets of sessions, one beginning in the morning (AM-encoding) and the other in the evening (PM-encoding). In each case, they were taught 12 words and were trained on a spatial memory task. Memory was assessed immediately, 12- and 24-hr later via stem-completion, picture-naming, and definition tasks to probe different aspects of word knowledge. Long-term retention was assessed 1-2 months later. Recall of word-forms improved over sleep and postsleep wake, as measured in both stem-completion and picture-naming tasks. Counter to hypotheses, deficits for poor comprehenders were not observed in consolidation but instead were seen across measures and throughout testing, suggesting a deficit from encoding. Variability in vocabulary knowledge across the whole sample predicted sleep-associated consolidation, but only when words were learned early in the day and not when sleep followed soon after learning. Poor comprehenders showed weaker memory for new words than good comprehenders, but sleep-associated consolidation benefits were comparable between groups. Sleeping soon after learning had long-lasting benefits for memory and may be especially beneficial for children with weaker vocabulary. These results provide new insights into the breadth of poor comprehenders' vocabulary weaknesses, and ways in which learning might be better timed to remediate vocabulary difficulties."
331,A,"In general, Internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy (iCBT) produces significant reductions in child and adolescent anxiety, but a proportion of participants continue to show clinical levels of anxiety after treatment. It is important to identify demographic, clinical, and family factors that predict who is most likely to benefit from iCBT in order to better tailor treatment to individual needs. Participants were 175 young people (7-18 years) with an anxiety disorder, and at least one of their parents, who completed an iCBT intervention with minimal therapist support. Multilevel modeling (MLM) examined predictors of response to iCBT as measured by the slope for changes in the primary outcome measures of child- and parent-reported anxiety scores, from pretreatment, to 12-weeks, 6-month, and 12-month follow-ups, controlling for pretreatment total clinician severity ratings of all anxiety diagnoses. Child age, gender, father age, parental education, parental mental health, parenting style, and family adaptability and cohesion did not significantly predict changes in anxiety in the multivariate analyses. For child-reported anxiety, greater reductions were predicted by a separation anxiety disorder diagnosis (SEP) and elevated depression, with lower reductions predicted by poor couple relationship quality. For parent-reported child anxiety, greater reductions were predicted by higher pretreatment total CSRs, SEP, and lower family income, with lower reductions for children of older mothers. Irrespective of these predictors of change, children in general showed reductions in anxiety to within the normal range. Overall, children responded well to iCBT irrespective of the demographic, clinical, and family factors examined here. Poor couple relationship quality and older mother age were risk factors for less positive response to iCBT in terms of reductions in anxiety symptoms although still to within the normal range."
332,A,"PTSD in youth may lead to long-lasting psychological implications, educational difficulties and increased healthcare costs. Psychological interventions have been shown to be effective in its management. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of a range of psychological interventions for children and young people with PTSD. A decision-analytic model was constructed to compare costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of 10 psychological interventions and no treatment for children and young people with PTSD, from the perspective of the National Health Service and personal social services in England. Effectiveness data were derived from a systematic review and network meta-analysis. Other model input parameters were based on published sources, supplemented by expert opinion. Cognitive therapy for PTSD, a form of individual trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TF-CBT), appeared to be the most cost-effective intervention for children and young people with PTSD (with a probability of .78 amongst the 11 evaluated options at a cost-effectiveness threshold of 20,000 pound/QALY), followed by narrative exposure (another form of individual TF-CBT), play therapy, and other forms of individual TF-CBT. After excluding cognitive therapy from the analysis, narrative exposure appeared to be the most cost-effective option with a .40 probability of being cost-effective amongst the remaining 10 options. EMDR, parent training and group TF-CBT occupied middle cost-effectiveness rankings. Family therapy and supportive counselling were less cost-effective than other active interventions. There was limited evidence for some interventions, in particular cognitive therapy for PTSD and parent training. Individual forms of TF-CBT and, to a lesser degree, play therapy appear to be cost-effective in the treatment of children and young people with PTSD. Family therapy and supportive counselling are unlikely to be cost-effective relative to other interventions. There is a need for well-conducted studies that examine the long-term clinical and cost-effectiveness of a range of psychological treatments for children and young people with PTSD."
333,A,"To conduct a comprehensive assessment of the association between aggression and academic performance in compulsory education. Method We studied aggression and academic performance in over 27,000 individuals from four European twin cohorts participating in the ACTION consortium (Aggression in Children: Unraveling gene-environment interplay to inform Treatment and InterventiON strategies). Individual level data on aggression at ages 7-16 were assessed by three instruments (Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment, Multidimensional Peer Nomination Inventory, Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire) including parental, teacher and self-reports. Academic performance was measured with teacher-rated grade point averages (ages 12-14) or standardized test scores (ages 12-16). Random effect meta-analytical correlations with academic performance were estimated for parental ratings (in all four cohorts) and self-ratings (in three cohorts). All between-family analyses indicated significant negative aggression-academic performance associations with correlations ranging from -.06 to -.33. were similar across different ages, instruments and raters and either with teacher-rated grade point averages or standardized test scores as measures of academic performance. Meta-analytical r's were -.20 and -.23 for parental and self-ratings, respectively. In within-family analyses of all twin pairs, the negative aggression-academic performance associations were statistically significant in 14 out of 17 analyses (r = -.17 for parental- and r = -.16 for self-ratings). Separate analyses in monozygotic (r = -.07 for parental and self-ratings), same-sex dizygotic (r's = -.16 and -.17 for parental and self-ratings) and opposite-sex dizygotic (r's = -.21 and -.19 for parental and self-ratings) twin pairs suggested partial confounding by genetic effects. There is a robust negative association between aggression and academic performance in compulsory education. Part of these associations were explained by shared genetic effects, but some evidence of a negative association between aggression and academic performance remained even in within-family analyses of monozygotic twin pairs."
334,C,"The gravitational-wave event GW 170817 was generated by the coalescence of two neutron stars and produced an electromagnetic transient, labelled AT 2017gfo, that was the target of a massive observational campaign. Polarimetry is a powerful diagnostic tool for probing the geometry and emission processes of unresolved sources, and the observed linear polarization for this event was consistent with being mostly induced by intervening dust, suggesting that the intrinsic emission was weakly polarized (P < 0.4-0.5%). Here we present a detailed analysis of the linear polarization expected from a merging neutron-star binary system by means of 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations assuming a range of possible configurations, wavelengths, epochs and viewing angles. We find that polarization originates from the non-homogeneous opacity distribution within the ejecta and can reach levels of 1% at early times (one to two days after the merger) and in the optical R band. Smaller polarization signals are expected at later epochs and different wavelengths. From the viewing-angle dependence of the polarimetric signal, we constrain the observer orientation of AT 2017gfo to within about 65 degrees from the polar direction. The detection of non-zero polarization in future events will unambiguously reveal the presence of a lanthanide-free ejecta component and unveil its spatial and angular distribution."
335,C,"Complex organic molecules (COMs), which are the seeds of prebiotic material and precursors of amino acids and sugars, form in the icy mantles of circumstellar dust grains(1) but cannot be detected remotely unless they are heated and released to the gas phase. Around solar-mass stars, water and COMs only sublimate in the inner few au of the circumstellar disk(2), making them extremely difficult to spatially resolve and study. Sudden increases in the luminosity of the central star will quickly expand the sublimation front (the so-called snow line) to larger radii, as seen previously in the FU Ori outburst of the young star V883 Ori(3). Here, we take advantage of the rapid increase in disk temperature of V883 Ori to detect and analyse five different COMs-methanol, acetone, acetonitrile, acetaldehyde and methyl formate-in spatially resolved submillimetre observations. The abundances of COMs in the disk around V883 Ori are in reasonable agreement with cometary values4, suggesting that outbursting young stars can provide a special opportunity to study the ice composition of material directly related to planet formation."
336,C,"The Milky Way's neutral hydrogen (Hi) disk is warped and flared(1,2). However, a dearth of accurate H-i-based distances has thus far prevented the development of an accurate Galactic Disk model. Moreover, the extent to which our Galaxy's stellar and gas disk morphologies are mutually consistent is also unclear. Classical Cepheids, primary distance indicators with distance accuracies of 3-5% (ref. (3)), offer a unique opportunity to develop an intuitive and accurate three-dimensional picture. Here, we establish a robust Galactic Disk model based on 1,339 classical Cepheids. We provide strong evidence that the warp's line of nodes is not oriented in the Galactic CentreSun direction. Instead, it subtends a mean angle of 17.5 degrees +/- 1 degrees (formal) +/- 3 degrees (systematic) and exhibits a leading spiral pattern. Our Galaxy thus follows Briggs' rule for spiral galaxies4, which suggests that the origin of the warp is associated with torques forced by the massive inner disk(5). The stellar disk traced by Cepheids follows the gas disk in terms of their amplitudes; the stellar disk extends to at least 20 kpc (refs. (6,7)). This morphology provides a crucial, updated map for studies of the kinematics and archaeology of the Galactic Disk."
337,C,"Many newly formed Sun-like stars show evidence of debris disks composed of dust generated through destructive collisions among residual planetesimals. These are inferred to survive at a detectable level over the first similar to 100 Myr of their parent star's lifetime. We hypothesize that the most primitive meteorites were processed as a result of impacts as our Solar System's debris disk dissipated, rather than as a result of heat generated by decay of Al-26. We show how the iodine-xenon (I-Xe) record from chondrules in the Chainpur meteorite supports this hypothesis, and use it to constrain the decline in the impact rate. We demonstrate that it is the creation of I-Xe sites during compaction that is recorded by the chondrule dataset. We show that, to account for the broader I-Xe record from primitive material, a consistent picture requires that the dissipation of our Solar System's debris disk had a timescale of around 40-50 Myr in this period. Against this backdrop, the late addition of siderophiles to the Earth in a single large impact may represent a rare phenomenon in planetary system formation that has been anthropically selected."
338,C,"Early spectral data from the Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRISREx) mission reveal evidence for abundant hydrated minerals on the surface of near-Earth asteroid (101955) Bennu in the form of a near-infrared absorption near 2.7 mu m and thermal infrared spectral features that are most similar to those of aqueously altered CM-type carbonaceous chondrites. We observe these spectral features across the surface of Bennu, and there is no evidence of substantial rotational variability at the spatial scales of tens to hundreds of metres observed to date. In the visible and near-infrared (0.4 to 2.4 mu m) Bennu's spectrum appears featureless and with a blue (negative) slope, confirming previous ground-based observations. Bennu may represent a class of objects that could have brought volatiles and organic chemistry to Earth."
339,C,"Establishing the abundance and physical properties of regolith and boulders on asteroids is crucial for understanding the formation and degradation mechanisms at work on their surfaces. Using images and thermal data from NASA's Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) spacecraft, we show that asteroid (101955) Bennu's surface is globally rough, dense with boulders, and low in albedo. The number of boulders is surprising given Bennu's moderate thermal inertia, suggesting that simple models linking thermal inertia to particle size do not adequately capture the complexity relating these properties. At the same time, we find evidence for a wide range of particle sizes with distinct albedo characteristics. Our findings imply that ages of Bennu's surface particles span from the disruption of the asteroid's parent body (boulders) to recent in situ production (micrometre-scale particles)."
340,C,"Planetary systems can survive stellar evolution, as is clear from the atmospheric metal pollution and circumstellar dusty disks of single white dwarfs(1,2). Recent observations show that 1-4% of single white dwarfs are accompanied by dusty disks(3-6), while the occurrence rate of metal pollution is about 25-50%(1,7,8). Dusty disks and metal pollution have been associated with accretion of remanent planetary systems around white dwarfs(1,9), yet the relationship between these two phenomena is still unclear. Here, we suggest an evolutionary scenario to link the dusty disk and metal pollution. By analysing a sample of metal-polluted white dwarfs, we find that the mass accretion rate onto the white dwarf generally follows a broken power-law decay, which matches well with the theoretical prediction, assuming that dust accretion is primarily driven by Poynting-Robertson drag(10) and the dust source is primarily delivered via dynamically falling asteroids perturbed by a Jovian planet(11,12). The presence of disks is mainly at the early stage (t(cool) similar to 0.1-0.7 Gyr) of the whole process of metal pollution, which is detectable until similar to 8 Gyr, naturally explaining the fraction (similar to 2-16%) of metal-polluted white dwarfs with dusty disks. The success of this scenario also implies that the configuration of an asteroid belt with an outer gas giant might be common around stars of several solar masses."
341,C,"During recent decades, data from space missions have provided strong evidence of deep liquid oceans underneath a thin outer icy crust on several moons of Jupiter(1,2), particularly Europa(3,4). But these observations have also raised many unanswered questions regarding the oceanic motions generated under the ice, or the mechanisms leading to the geological features observed on Europas(5,6). By means of direct numerical simulations of Europa's interior, we show here that Jupiter's magnetic field generates a retrograde oceanic jet at the equator, which may influence the global dynamics of Europa's ocean and contribute to the formation of some of its surface features by applying a unidirectional torque on Europa's ice shell."
342,C,"In 1981, the idea of a superwind that ends the life of cool giant stars was proposed(1). Extreme oxygen-rich giants, OH/IR stars, develop superwinds with the highest mass-loss rates known so far, up to a few 10(-4) solar masses (M-circle dot) per year(2-12), informing our understanding of the maximum mass-loss rate achieved during the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. A conundrum arises whereby the observationally determined duration of the superwind phase is too short for these stars to lose enough mass to become white dwarfs( 2-4,6,8-10). Here we report on the detection of spiral structures around two cornerstone extreme OH/IR stars, OH 26.5 + 0.6 and OH 30.1- 0.7, thereby identifying them as wide binary systems. Hydrodynamic simulations show that the companion's gravitational attraction creates an equatorial density enhancement mimicking a short, extreme superwind phase, thereby solving the decades-old conundrum. This discovery restricts the maximum mass-loss rate of AGB stars to around the singlescattering radiation pressure limit of a few 10(-5)M(circle dot) yr(-1). This has crucial implications for nucleosynthetic yields, planet survival and the wind-driving mechanism."
343,C,"Measures of exoplanet bulk densities indicate that small exoplanets with radius less than 3 Earth radii (R-circle plus) range from low-density sub-Neptunes containing volatile elements(1) to higher-density rocky planets with Earth-like(2) or iron-rich(3) (Mercury-like) compositions. Such astonishing diversity in observed small exoplanet compositions may be the product of different initial conditions of the planet-formation process or different evolutionary paths that altered the planetary properties after formation(4). Planet evolution may be especially affected by either photoevaporative mass loss induced by high stellar X-ray and extreme ultraviolet (XUV) flux(5) or giant impacts(6). Although there is some evidence for the former(7,8) there are no unambiguous findings so far about the occurrence of giant impacts in an exoplanet system. Here, we characterize the two innermost planets of the compact and near-resonant system Kepler-107 (ref.(9)). We show that they have nearly identical radii (about 1.5-1.6R(circle plus)), but the outer planet Kepler-107c is more than twice as dense (about 12.6 g cm(-3) ) as the innermost Kepler-107b (about 5.3g cm(-3)). In consequence, Kepler-107 c must have a larger iron core fraction than Kepler-107 b. This imbalance cannot be explained by the stellar XUV irradiation, which would conversely make the more-irradiated and less-massive planet Kepler-107b denser than Kepler-107c. Instead, the dissimilar densities are consistent with a giant impact event on Kepler-107 c that would have stripped off part of its silicate mantle. This hypothesis is supported by theoretical predictions from collisional mantle stripping(10), which match the mass and radius of Kepler-107c."
344,C,"It has long been suspected that tidal forces in close binary stars could modify the orientation of the pulsation axis of the constituent stars. Such stars have been searched for, but until now never detected. Here we report the discovery of tidally trapped pulsations in the ellipsoidal variable HD 74423 in Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) space photometry data. The system contains a delta Scuti pulsator in a 1.6 d orbit, whose pulsation mode amplitude is strongly modulated at the orbital frequency, which can be explained if the pulsations have a much larger amplitude in one hemisphere of the star. We interpret this as an obliquely pulsating distorted dipole oscillation with a pulsation axis aligned with the tidal axis. This is the first time that oblique pulsation along a tidal axis has been recognized. It is unclear whether the pulsations are trapped in the hemisphere directed towards the companion or in the side facing away from it, but future spectral measurements can provide the solution. In the meantime, the single-sided pulsator HD 74423 stands out as the prototype of a new class of obliquely pulsating stars in which the interactions of stellar pulsations and tidal distortion can be studied. HD 74423 is an unusual binary star system containing two lambda Bootis pulsators. TESS photometry reveals that one of the pair is pulsating along its tidal axis-but only in one hemisphere. Such an odd arrangement provides an interesting laboratory in which to study stellar pulsations and tidal distortion."
345,C,"Interstellar comets offer direct samples of volatiles from distant protoplanetary disks. 2I/Borisov is the first notably active interstellar comet discovered in our Solar System(1). Comets are condensed samples of the gas, ice and dust that were in a star's protoplanetary disk during the formation of its planets, and inform our understanding on how chemical compositions and abundances vary with distance from the central star. Their orbital migration distributes volatiles(2), organic material and prebiotic chemicals around their host system(3). In our Solar System, hundreds of comets have been observed remotely, and a few have been studied up close by space missions(4). However, knowledge of extrasolar comets has been limited to what could be gleaned from distant, unresolved observations of cometary regions around other stars, with only one detection of carbon monoxide(5). Here we report that the coma of 2I/Borisov contains substantially more CO than H2O gas, with abundances of at least 173%, more than three times higher than previously measured for any comet in the inner (<2.5 au) Solar System(4). Our ultraviolet Hubble Space Telescope observations of 2I/Borisov provide the first glimpse into the ice content and chemical composition of the protoplanetary disk of another star that is substantially different from our own. Hubble Space Telescope data show that interstellar comet 2I/Borisov has an unusually high CO/H2O ratio-higher than any other comet that has been seen in the inner regions of our Solar System. This allows us to constrain the nature and location of the circumstellar region from which 2I/Borisov originated."
346,C,"A defining characteristic of the planet Venus is its thick, CO2-dominated atmosphere. Despite over 50 years of robotic exploration of Venus, including thirteen successful atmospheric probes and landers, our knowledge of N-2, the second most abundant compound in the atmosphere, is highly uncertain(1). We report the first measurement of the nitrogen content of Venus's atmosphere at altitudes between 60 and 100 km. Our result, 5.0 +/- 0.4 v% N-2, is 40% higher than the value of 3.5 v% N-2 reported for the lower atmosphere (<50 km altitude). Our discovery of altitude-dependent variations in the N-2 content of the atmosphere defies early expectations of homogeneous composition below 100 km (for example, see ref. (1)), and necessitates complete chemical modelling to investigate chemical versus physical explanations for the enhanced N-2 in the upper atmosphere. The existence of chemically distinct lower and upper atmosphere regions complicates the use of remote sensing measurements of the upper atmosphere to infer the properties of the lower atmosphere and surface, an important lesson that also extends to the growing field of exoplanet astronomy. A MESSENGER flyby of Venus has detected a difference in N-2 composition between the upper and lower atmosphere. The presence of substantially distinct regions within Venus's atmosphere has implications on remote sensing techniques for exoplanets."
347,C,"Interstellar comet Borisov has thus far looked very much like a Solar System comet in terms of its volatile content, but with new data from ALMA that show robust detections of CO and HCN, it is clear that Borisov is rich in CO, helping to pinpoint its origin. Comets spend most of their lives at large distances from any star, during which time their interior compositions remain relatively unaltered. Cometary observations can therefore provide direct insight into the chemistry that occurred during their birth at the time of planet formation(1). To date, there have been no confirmed observations of parent volatiles (gases released directly from the nucleus) of a comet from any planetary system other than our own. Here, we present high-resolution interferometric observations of 2I/Borisov, the first confirmed interstellar comet, obtained using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) on 15-16 December 2019. Our observations reveal emission from hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and carbon monoxide (CO) coincident with the expected position of 2I/Borisov's nucleus, with production rates Q(HCN) = (7.0 +/- 1.1) x 10(23) s(-1) and Q(CO) = (4.4 +/- 0.7) x 10(26) s(-1). While the HCN abundance relative to water (0.06-0.16%) appears similar to that of typical, previously observed comets in our Solar System, the abundance of CO (35-105%) is among the highest observed in any comet within 2 au of the Sun. This shows that 2I/Borisov must have formed in a relatively CO-rich environment-probably beyond the CO ice-line in the very cold, outer regions of a distant protoplanetary accretion disk, as part of a population of small icy bodies analogous to our Solar System's own proto-Kuiper belt."
348,C,"Planetary nebulae are the ionized ejected envelopes surrounding the remnant cores of dying stars. Theory predicts that main-sequence stars of one to about eight solar masses may eventually form planetary nebulae. Until now, this has not been confirmed at the higher end of the mass range. Here we report that the planetary nebula BMP J1613-5406 is associated with the Galactic star cluster NGC 6067. Stars evolving off the main sequence of this cluster have a mass of around five solar masses. Our confidence in the association between the planetary nebula and the cluster comes from their tightly consistent radial velocities in a sightline with a steep velocity-distance gradient, common distances, and reddening and location of the planetary nebula within the cluster boundary. This is an unprecedented example of a planetary nebula whose progenitor star mass approaches the theoretical lower limit of core-collapse supernova formation. This finding provides observational evidence supporting theoretical predictions that stars of five solar masses and more can form planetary nebulae."
349,C,"The pyrolysis experiments of the SAM instrument on board the Curiosity rover reconstruct the origin of organics at Gale crater. Some of them come from meteorites, but others have been formed in situ, with widespread past formation of carbonates via cryogenesis. More than 0.5 bar of CO2 might have precipitated from the atmosphere. Since landing at Gale crater, Mars, in August 2012, the Curiosity rover has searched for evidence of past habitability, such as organic compounds, which have proved elusive to previous missions. We report results from pyrolysis experiments by Curiosity's Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument, focusing on the isotopic compositions of evolved CO2 and O-2, which provide clues to the identities and origins of carbon- and oxygen-bearing phases in surface materials. We find that O-2 is enriched in O-18 (delta O-18 about 40 parts per thousand). Its behaviour reflects the presence of oxychlorine compounds at the Martian surface, common to aeolian and sedimentary deposits. Peak temperatures and isotope ratios (delta O-18 from -61 +/- 4 parts per thousand to 64 +/- 7 parts per thousand; delta C-13 from -25 +/- 20 parts per thousand to 56 +/- 11 parts per thousand) of evolved CO2 indicate the presence of carbon in multiple phases. We suggest that some organic compounds reflect exogenous input from meteorites and interplanetary dust, while others could derive from in situ formation processes on Mars, such as abiotic photosynthesis or electrochemical reduction of CO2. The observed carbonate abundances could reflect a sink for about 425-640 millibar of atmospheric CO2, while an additional 100-170 millibar could be stored in oxalates formed at the surface. In addition, oxygen isotope ratios of putative carbonates suggest the possibility of widespread cryogenic carbonate formation during a previous era."
350,C,"Calcium-aluminium-rich inclusions (CAIs) are one of the first solids to have condensed in the solar nebula, while presolar grains formed in various evolved stellar environments. It is generally accepted that CAIs formed close to the Sun at temperatures above 1,500 K, where presolar grains could not survive, and were then transported to other regions of the nebula where the accretion of planetesimals took place. In this context, a commonly held view is that presolar grains are found solely in the fine-grained rims surrounding chondrules and in the low-temperature fine-grained matrix that binds the various meteoritic components together. Here we demonstrate, on the basis of noble gas isotopic signatures, that presolar SiC grains were incorporated into fine-grained CAIs in the Allende carbonaceous chondrite at the time of their formation, and have survived parent-body processing. This finding provides new clues on the conditions in the nascent Solar System at the condensation of the first solids."
351,C,"The light curves of type Ia supernovae are routinely used to constrain cosmology models. Driven by radioactive decay of Ni-56, the light curves steadily decline over time, but after 150 d post-explosion the near-infrared portion is poorly characterized. We report a year-long plateau in the near-infrared light curve at 150-500 d, followed by a second decline phase accompanied by a possible appearance of [Fe i] emission lines. This near-infrared plateau contrasts sharply with type IIP plateaux and requires a new physical mechanism. We suggest a masking of the 'near-infrared catastrophe'-a predicted, yet unobserved, sharp light-curve decline-by scattering of ultraviolet photons to longer wavelengths. The transition off the plateau could be due to a change in the dominant ionization state of the supernova ejecta. Our results help explain the complex radiative transfer processes that take place in type Ia supernovae and enhance their use as 'standard candles'. Graur et al. present near-infrared light curves of five type Ia supernovae based on Hubble Space Telescope data that show plateaux at late times (>150 days) rather than the expected 'infrared catastrophe'. The authors suggest that the year-long plateaux are produced by the scattering of ultraviolet photons."
352,C,"It is difficult to reproduce the formation and composition of the moons of Uranus with a standard giant-impact model. Observations and modelling can be reconciled if the evolution of the water content in the disk, which is assumed to be vaporized and thus mostly accretes onto the planet before recondensation, is considered. The ice-giant planet Uranus probably underwent a giant impact, given that its spin axis is tilted by 98 degrees(1-3). That its satellite system is equally inclined and prograde suggests that it was formed as a consequence of the impact. However, the disks predicted by the impact simulations(1,3,4) generally have sizes one order smaller and masses two orders larger than those of the observed system at present. Here we show, by means of a theoretical model, that the Uranian satellite formation is regulated by the evolution of the impact-generated disk. Because the vaporization temperature of water ice is low and both Uranus and the impactor are assumed to be ice-dominated, we can conclude that the impact-generated disk has mostly vaporized. We predict that the disk lost a substantial amount of water vapour mass and spread to the levels of the current system until the disk cooled down enough for ice condensation and accretion of icy particles to begin. From the predicted distribution of condensed ices, our N-body simulation is able to reproduce the observed mass-orbit configuration of Uranian satellites. This scenario contrasts with the giant-impact model for the Earth's Moon(5), in which about half of the compact, impact-generated, solid or liquid disk is immediately incorporated into the Moon on impact(6)."
353,C,The support of the international astronomical community to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is fundamental to advance the rights and needs of the most vulnerable groups of our global society. Among these groups are the refugees.
354,C,"Lyman-alpha blobs (LABs) are spatially extended nebulae of emission in the Lyman-alpha (Ly alpha) line of hydrogen, seen at high redshifts(1,2), and most commonly found in the dense environment of star-forming galaxies(3,4). A recent study showed that nearly 100% of the sky is covered by Ly alpha emission around high-redshift galaxies(5-7). The origin of Ly alpha emission in the LABs is still unclear and under debate(8). It may be powered by photoionization involving galactic superwinds/outflows, resonant scattering of Ly alpha photons from starbursts or active galactic nuclei(9-16), or by cooling radiation from cold streams of gas accreting onto galaxies(17,18), as demonstrated by recent simulations(19). Here we analyse the gas kinematics within a LAB, providing rare observational evidence for infalling gas. This is consistent with the release of gravitational accretion energy as cold streams radiate Ly alpha photons. It also provides direct evidence for possible cold streams feeding the central galaxies. The mass of the infalling gas is not important in comparison to the gas mass consumed by star formation, and is also not the major powering source of Ly alpha emission, but it hints at another mechanism to explain the origin of the extended Ly alpha emission around young galaxies. The gas kinematics within a Lyman-alpha blob show clear evidence of infall, consistent with the release of gravitational accretion energy as cold streams radiate Lyman-alpha photons. These cold streams are apparently responsible for feeding central galaxies."
355,C,"Active eruptions from the south polar region of Saturn's similar to 500-km-diameter moon Enceladus are concentrated along a series of lineaments known as the 'tiger stripes'(1,2), thought to be partially open fissures that connect to the liquid water ocean beneath the ice shell(3,4). To date, no study simultaneously explains why the tiger stripes should be located only at the south pole, why there are multiple approximately parallel and regularly spaced fractures, what accounts for their spacing of about 35 km, and why similarly active fissures have not been observed on other icy bodies. Here we propose that secular cooling, which leads to a thickening of the ice shell and building of global tensile stresses(5,6), causes the first fracture to form at one of the poles, where the ice shell is thinnest owing to tidal heating(7). The tensile stresses are thereby relieved, preventing a similar failure at the opposite pole. The steadily erupting water ice loads the flanks of the open fissure, causing bending in the surrounding elastic plate and further tensile failure in bands parallel to the first fracture-a process that may be unique to Enceladus, where the gravity is too weak for compressive stresses to prevent fracture propagation through the thin ice shell. The sequence of fissures then cascades outwards until the loading becomes too weak or the background shell thickness becomes too great to permit through-going fractures."
356,C,"The Crab nebula is so far the only celestial object with a statistically significant detection in soft X-ray polarimetry(1-4), a window that has not been explored in astronomy since the 1970s. However, soft X-ray polarimetry is expected to be a sensitive probe of magnetic fields in high-energy astrophysical objects, including rotation-powered pulsars(5-7) and pulsar wind nebulae(8). Here we report the re-detection of soft X-ray polarization after 40 years from the Crab nebula and pulsar with PolarLight(9), a miniature polarimeter utilizing a novel technique(10,11) onboard a CubeSat. The polarization fraction of the Crab in the on-pulse phases was observed to decrease after a glitch of the Crab pulsar on 23 July 2019, while that of the pure nebular emission remained constant within uncertainty. The phenomenon may have lasted about 100 days. If the association between the glitch and polarization change can be confirmed with future observations, it will place strong constraints on the physical mechanism of the high-energy emission(12-14) and glitch(15-17) of pulsars. A soft X-ray polarimetry capability has been missing from astronomy since the late 1970s. Here a CubeSat polarimeter named PolarLight has detected the Crab nebula and pulsar in the soft X-ray band, measuring their polarized emission. PolarLight observed a pulsar glitch, with an associated polarization change."
357,C,"Two sources of variability are reported in extreme horizontal branch (EHB) stars found in globular clusters, both related to the action of weak magnetic fields: large surface spots and very energetic flares. EHB stars in clusters can thus be linked to EHB field stars, and beyond, to other stars with radiative envelopes. For more than six decades, the quest to understand the formation of hot (about 20,000-30,000 K) extreme horizontal branch (EHB) stars in Galactic globular clusters has remained one of the most elusive in stellar evolutionary theory. Here we report on two discoveries that challenge the idea of the stable luminosity of EHB stars. The first mode of EHB variability is periodic and cannot be ascribed to either binary evolution or pulsation. Instead, we attribute it here to the presence of magnetic spots: superficial chemical inhomogeneities whose projected rotation induces the variability. The second mode of EHB variability is aperiodic and manifests itself on timescales of years. In two cases, six-year-long light curves display superflare events that are several million times more energetic than solar analogues. We advocate a scenario in which the two EHB variability phenomena are different manifestations of diffuse, dynamo-generated, weak magnetic fields. Magnetism is therefore a key player driving the formation and evolution of EHB clusters stars and, likewise, operating in the Galactic field counterparts. Our conclusions bridge similar variability/magnetism phenomena in all radiative-enveloped hot-stars: young main-sequence stars, old EHBs and defunct white dwarfs."
358,C,"Although fullerenes have long been hypothesized to occur in interstellar environments, they have only recently been unambiguously identified through spectroscopy(1-4). C-60, C-70 and C-60(+) now constitute the largest molecular species individually identified in the interstellar medium. Fullerenes have substantial proton affinities and it has been suggested that C-60(H+) is likely the most abundant interstellar analogue of C-60 (ref.(5)). We present here a laboratory infrared (IR) spectrum of gaseous C60H+. Symmetry breaking in C60H+ produces an IR spectrum that is much richer than that of C-60. The experimental spectrum is used to benchmark theoretical spectra indicating that the B3LYP density functional with the 6-311+G(d,p) basis set accurately reproduces the spectrum. Comparison with IR emission spectra from two planetary nebulae, SMP LMC56 and SMC16, which have been associated with high C-60 abundances, indicates that C60H+ is a plausible contributor to their IR emission."
359,C,"In the standard cosmological model, dark matter drives the structure formation of galaxies and constructs potential wells within which galaxies may form. The baryon fraction in dark halos can reach the Universal value (15.7%) in massive clusters and decreases rapidly as the mass of the system decreases(1,2). The formation of dwarf galaxies is sensitive both to baryonic processes and the properties of dark matter owing to the shallow potential wells in which they form. In dwarf galaxies in the Local Group, dark matter dominates the mass content even within their optical-light half-radii (r(e) approximate to 1 kpc)(3,4). However, recently it has been argued that not all dwarf galaxies are dominated by dark matter(5-7). Here we report 19 dwarf galaxies that could consist mainly of baryons up to radii well beyond r(e), at which point they are expected to be dominated by dark matter. Of these, 14 are isolated dwarf galaxies, free from the influence of nearby bright galaxies and high-density environments. This result provides observational evidence that could challenge the formation theory of low-mass galaxies within the framework of standard cosmology. Further observations, in particular deep imaging and spatially resolved kinematics, are needed to constrain the baryon fraction better in such galaxies."
360,C,"The direct measurement of gravitational waves is a powerful tool for surveying the population of black holes across the universe. While LIGO has detected black holes as heavy as similar to 50 M-circle dot (ref.(1)), there is not yet unambiguous evidence of black holes in the intermediate mass range of 10(2-5) M-circle dot. Recent electromagnetic observations have hinted towards the existence of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs)(2-4); however, their masses remain poorly constrained. Here we argue that multi-band observations by space- and ground-based gravitational wave detectors(5,6) will be able to survey a broad population of IMBHs at cosmological distances. By utilizing general relativistic simulations of merging black holes(7) and state-of-the-art gravitational waveform models(8), we classify three distinct populations of binaries with IMBHs and discuss what can be observed about each. Multiband observations involving the upgraded LIGO detector(9) and the proposed space-mission LISA(10) would detect the inspiral, merger and ring-down of IMBH binaries out to redshift approximate to 2, pushing out to redshift approximate to 5 if next-generation ground-based detectors(11,12) are operational at the same time. To facilitate studies of multiband IMBH sources, we provide analytic relations for the maximum redshift of multiband detectability, as a function of black hole mass, for various detector combinations. Our study paves the way for future work on what can be learned from IMBH observations in the era of multiband gravitational wave astronomy."
361,E,"Higher education institutions are mining and analyzing student data to effect educational, political, and managerial outcomes. Done under the banner of """"learning analytics,"""" this work can-and often does-surface sensitive data and information about, inter alia, a student's demographics, academic performance, offline and online movements, physical fitness, mental wellbeing, and social network. With these data, institutions and third parties are able to describe student life, predict future behaviors, and intervene to address academic or other barriers to student success (however defined). Learning analytics, consequently, raise serious issues concerning student privacy, autonomy, and the appropriate flow of student data. We argue that issues around privacy lead to valid questions about the degree to which students should trust their institution to use learning analytics data and other artifacts (algorithms, predictive scores) with their interests in mind. We argue that higher education institutions are paradigms of information fiduciaries. As such, colleges and universities have a special responsibility to their students. In this article, we use the information fiduciary concept to analyze cases when learning analytics violate an institution's responsibility to its students."
362,E,"Social media data provide increasing opportunities for the automated analysis of large sets of textual documents. So far, automated tools have been developed either to account for the social networks among participants in the debates, or to analyze the content of these debates. Less attention has been paid to mapping co-occurrences of actors (participants) and topics (content) in online debates that can be considered as socio-semantic networks. We propose a new, automated approach that uses the whole matrix of co-addressed topics and actors for understanding and visualizing online debates. We show the advantages of the new approach with the analysis of two data sets: first, a large set of English-language Twitter messages at the Rio + 20 meeting, in June 2012 (72,077 tweets), and second, a smaller data set of Dutch-language Twitter messages on bird flu related to poultry farming in 2015-2017 (2,139 tweets). We discuss the theoretical, methodological, and substantive implications of our approach, also for the analysis of other social media data."
363,E,"This article addresses the problem of detecting crisis-related messages on social media, in order to improve the situational awareness of emergency services. Previous work focused on developing machine-learning classifiers restricted to specific disasters, such as storms or wild-fires. We investigate for the first time methods to detect such messages where the type of the crisis is not known in advance, that is, the data are highly heterogeneous. Data heterogeneity causes significant difficulties for learning algorithms to generalize and accurately label incoming data. Our main contributions are as follows. First, we evaluate the extent of this problem in the context of disaster management, finding that the performance of traditional learners drops by up to 40% when trained and tested on heterogeneous data vis-a-vis homogeneous data. Then, in order to overcome data heterogeneity, we propose a new ensemble learning method, and found this to perform on a par with the Gradient Boosting and AdaBoost ensemble learners. The methods are studied on a benchmark data set comprising 26 disaster events and four classification problems: detection of relevant messages, informative messages, eyewitness reports, and topical classification of messages. Finally, in a case study, we evaluate the proposed methods on a real-world data set to assess its practical value."
364,E,"To understand and improve their current abilities and maturity, organizations use diagnostic instruments such as maturity models and other assessment frameworks. Increasing numbers of these are being developed in digital curation. Their central role in strategic decision making raises the need to evaluate their fitness for this purpose and develop guidelines for their design and evaluation. A comprehensive review of assessment frameworks, however, found little evidence that existing assessment frameworks have been evaluated systematically, and no methods for their evaluation. This article proposes a new methodology for evaluating the design and use of assessment frameworks. It builds on prior research on maturity models and combines analytic and empirical evaluation methods to explain how the design of assessment frameworks influences their application in practice, and how the design process can effectively take this into account. We present the evaluation methodology and its application to two frameworks. The evaluation results lead to guidelines for the design process of assessment frameworks in digital curation. The methodology provides insights to the designers of the evaluated frameworks that they can consider in future revisions; methodical guidance for researchers in the field; and practical insights and words of caution to organizations keen on diagnosing their abilities."
365,E,"Gratitude is a fundamental aspect of social interaction that positively influences emotional and social well-being. It is also crucial for promoting online community health by motivating participation. However, how gratitude occurs and can be encouraged in online communities is not yet well understood. This exploratory study investigated how online community users experience gratitude, focusing on how gratitude expression and acknowledgment occurs, can break down or can be reinforced. Semistructured Critical Incident interviews were conducted with 8 users of various online communities, including discussion and support groups, social Q&A sites, and review sites, eliciting 17 memorable examples of giving and receiving thanks online. The findings gave rise to a process model of gratitude in online communities-the """"gratitude cycle,"""" which provides a detailed, holistic understanding of the experience of gratitude online that can inform the design of online community platforms that aim to motivate users to perpetuate the cycle. An enriched understanding of gratitude in online communities can help ensure future platforms better support the expression and acknowledgment of thanks, encouraging participation."
366,E,"Collaborations are pervasive in current science. Collaborations have been studied and encouraged in many disciplines. However, little is known about how a team really functions from the detailed division of labor within. In this research, we investigate the patterns of scientific collaboration and division of labor within individual scholarly articles by analyzing their co-contributorship networks. Co-contributorship networks are constructed by performing the one-mode projection of the author-task bipartite networks obtained from 138,787 articles published in PLoS journals. Given an article, we define 3 types of contributors: Specialists, Team-players, and Versatiles. Specialists are those who contribute to all their tasks alone; team-players are those who contribute to every task with other collaborators; and versatiles are those who do both. We find that team-players are the majority and they tend to contribute to the 5 most common tasks as expected, such as """"data analysis"""" and """"performing experiments."""" The specialists and versatiles are more prevalent than expected by our designed 2 null models. Versatiles tend to be senior authors associated with funding and supervision. Specialists are associated with 2 contrasting roles: the supervising role as team leaders or marginal and specialized contributors."
367,B,"The Paris Agreement advances a heterogeneous approach to international climate cooperation. Such an approach may be undermined by carbon leakage-the displacement of emissions from states with more to less stringent climate policy constraints. Border carbon adjustments offer a promising response to leakage, but they also raise concerns about their compatibility with international trade law. This Article provides a comprehensive analysis of border carbon adjustments and proposes a way to design them that balances legal, administrative, and environmental considerations."
368,E,"The popular outdoor pursuit of backpacking is profoundly changing as the community embraces contemporary information technologies. However, there is little empirical evidence on the adoption and use of consumer electronics by backpackers, nor the implications this has for their habits, practices, and interactions. We investigate long-distance backpackers' articulations with mobile information technology during the TGO Challenge, a coast-to-coast crossing of the Scottish Highlands. By employing mixed methods, we explore how and why backpackers use such technology when planning and undertaking their journeys via a survey (n = 116), pre- and post-challenge interviews with selected TGO participants, and daily in-field video-logs. Our results suggest many advantages to using technology in this context, including fluidity of communications and access, while noting that reliance on technology is leading to issues such as increased need for battery power management, and deskilling. The findings highlight implications for the juxtaposition between outdoor recreation, information behavior, and human computer interaction (HCI) and suggest future work in this area."
369,E,"The emergence of open access (OA) publishing has altered incentives and opportunities for academic stakeholders and publishers. These changes have yielded a variety of new economic and academic niches, including journals with questionable peer-review systems and business models, commonly dubbed """"predatory publishing."""" Empirical analysis of Cabell & apos;s Journal Blacklist reveals substantial diversity in types and degrees of predatory publishing. While some blacklisted publishers produce journals with many severe violations of academic norms, """"gray"""" journals and publishers occupy borderline or ambiguous niches between predation and legitimacy. Predation in academic publishing is not a simple binary phenomenon and should instead be perceived as a spectrum with varying types and degrees of illegitimacy. Conceptions of predation are based on overlapping evaluations of academic and economic legitimacy. High institutional status benefits publishers by reducing conflicts between-if not aligning-professional and market institutional logics, which are more likely to conflict and create illegitimacy concerns in downmarket niches. High rejection rates imbue high-status journals with value and pricing power, while low-status OA journals face """"predatory"""" incentives to optimize revenue via low selectivity. Status influences the social acceptability of profit-seeking in academic publishing, rendering lower-status publishers vulnerable to being perceived and stigmatized as illegitimate."
370,E,"This conceptual article argues for the value of an approach to privacy in the digital information environment informed by Luciano Floridi's philosophy of information and information ethics. This approach involves achieving informational privacy, through the features of anonymity and obscurity, through an optimal balance of ontological frictions. This approach may be used to modify models for information behavior and for information literacy, giving them a fuller and more effective coverage of privacy issues in the infosphere. For information behavior, the Information Seeking and Communication Model and the Information Grounds conception are most appropriate for this purpose. For information literacy, the metaliteracy model, using a modification a privacy literacy framework, is most suitable."
371,E,"The purpose of the study was to understand if and how 2 proposed facets of self-identity (work-self and career-self) and journals' perceived quality (impact, visibility, and content quality) influence and explain the intention to publish in open access (OA) or nonopen access (non-OA) journals. This study integrates attitude and identity theory within a cross-sectional survey design. The sample consists of about 1,600 researchers in Norway, and the data were collected via e-mail invitation using a digital surveying tool and analyzed using structural equation modeling techniques. We determined that perceived impact-quality increases the intention to publish non-OA, while decreasing the intention to publish OA. Content quality is only associated with non-OA journals. Perceived visibility increases the intention to publish OA, while the opposite effect is found for non-OA. Career-self salience has the strongest effect on impact-quality, while content quality is most important when work-self is salient. This research contributes to a deeper understanding about how perceived quality influences intention to publish in OA and non-OA journals, and how self-identity salience affects different facets of perceived quality in valence and strength. Findings have implications for policy development, implementation, and assessment and may contribute to improving OA adoption."
372,E,"Statistical significance tests can provide evidence that the observed difference in performance between 2 methods is not due to chance. In information retrieval (IR), some studies have examined the validity and suitability of such tests for comparing search systems. We argue here that current methods for assessing the reliability of statistical tests suffer from some methodological weaknesses, and we propose a novel way to study significance tests for retrieval evaluation. Using Score Distributions, we model the output of multiple search systems, produce simulated search results from such models, and compare them using various significance tests. A key strength of this approach is that we assess statistical tests under perfect knowledge about the truth or falseness of the null hypothesis. This new method for studying the power of significance tests in IR evaluation is formal and innovative. Following this type of analysis, we found that both the sign test and Wilcoxon signed test have more power than the permutation test and the t-test. The sign test and Wilcoxon signed test also have good behavior in terms of type I errors. The bootstrap test shows few type I errors, but it has less power than the other methods tested."
373,E,"The benefits of open data for helping to address societal problems and strengthen communities are well recognized, and unfortunately previous studies found that smaller communities are often excluded from the current data ecosystem because of existing technological, technical, cognitive, and practical barriers. This study aims to investigate the process of communities & apos; data use for community development and decision-making-focusing on the opportunities and challenges of data for communities. From the interviews with 25 staff from community-based organizations (CBOs) in nine small, medium, and large cities in the United States, the findings of this study describe data & apos;s role in supporting communities & apos; development while reporting several major challenges that hinder CBOs data use: difficulty accessing data, limitations of open data (un-local nature, excluding essential data from being open), limited data capacity (especially in data literacy skills), and difficulties using and accessing existing data infrastructures. Our findings suggest opportunities for addressing these challenges, particularly by creating educational programming, building partnerships within data ecosystems, and bringing community voices forward in current data ecosystems, which are critical to realizing data & apos;s potential for all citizens."
374,B,"In Georgia v. Russia (I) (Just Satisfaction), the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR or Court) ordered the Russian Federation to pay Georgia EUR 10 million as reparation for Russia's """"coordinated policy of arresting, detaining and expelling Georgian nationals"""" in the autumn of 2006 (paras. 51, 80). In so doing, the Court reaffirmed its position from Cyprus v. Turkey (IV) (Just Satisfaction) that financial compensation for non-pecuniary damage can be awarded in interstate cases. Although Georgia v. Russia (I) (Just Satisfaction) marks the development of a new line of ECtHR jurisprudence, it is unlikely that the decision will effectively prevent further mass violations of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR or Convention) by the states parties or offer fair compensation to the victims of such violations."
375,B,"The ruling of the Spanish Supreme Court in Judgment No. 1263/2018, recognizing, for the first time, the binding character of the Views of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW Committee), augmented the normative authority of the Views of the human rights treaty monitoring body, not only at the domestic level, but also within the international legal sphere. In the Judgment, the Spanish highest court held that the government must comply with the Views of the CEDAW Committee as a matter of the state's constitutional mandate as well as its international obligations. The Court's interpretation in this case meets the expectation of human rights treaty monitoring bodies that states are obligated to respond to their Views concerning individual communications, despite some states parties' claims to the contrary."
376,B,"On October 30, 2018, the South Korean Supreme Court, in an 11-2 decision, upheld the judgment of the lower court, which ordered New Nippon Steel Corporation, a Japanese company, to provide KRW 100 million (approximately USD 84,000) in compensation to each of the four plaintiffs, who were forced to work at Japanese steel mills during World War II. In an earlier 2012 decision, the Supreme Court remanded the case after holding that the claims were not precluded by the Agreement on the Settlement of Problems Concerning Property and Claims and the Economic Cooperation Between the Republic of Korea and Japan (Claims Agreement). The Supreme Court held that the Claims Agreement was not a result of negotiation about compensation for Japanese colonization, but rather was a political agreement the purpose of which was to resolve the financial and civil debt/credit relationship between Korea and Japan. On the final appeal, the Supreme Court concluded that plaintiffs' claims were directly related to the illegality of Japan's colonial rule over the Korean Peninsula and that the rights of the victims of forced labor to make a compensation claim did not fall within the scope of the Claims Agreement."
377,B,"The Trump administration formally recognized Juan Guaido as the interim president of Venezuela on January 23, 2019, making the United States the first nation to officially accept the legitimacy of Guaido's government and reject incumbent President Nicolas Maduro's claim to the presidency. In a campaign designed to oust Maduro from power, the United States has encouraged foreign governments and intergovernmental organizations to recognize Guaido and has imposed a series of targeted economic sanctions to weaken Maduro's regime. As of June 2019, however, Maduro remained in power within Venezuela."
378,B,"On April 8, 2019, President Trump announced that his administration would designate Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) as a foreign terrorist organization (FTO) under Section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). This is the first time the United States has designated an arm of another government, rather than a non-state actor, as an FTO. In his announcement, Trump asserted that the Iranian government has used the IRGC to engage in a campaign of global terrorism. The measure, which officially took effect on April 15, expands on previous terrorism-related sanctions imposed on the IRGC and Iran."
379,B,"In a reversal of decades of U.S. foreign policy, on March 25, 2019, President Trump issued a presidential proclamation recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, a strategic piece of territory captured by Israel from Syria during the Six-Day War in 1967. This move, which generated international criticism, is the latest in a series of actions by the Trump administration that advance the interests of the Israeli government."

The court found the Syrian government liable for the death of Marie Colvin, who died in an artillery shelling on February 22, 2012, at a media center in the city of Homs. Colvin was a heralded war correspondent who had previously """"cover[ed] conflict zones in Iraq, Chechnya, the Balkans, East Timor, Sri Lanka, Sierra Leone, and Libya."""" Colvin's heirs brought suit, claiming that because Syria had been designated a """"state sponsor of terrorism,"""" it could be held liable for an extrajudicial killing of a U.S. national under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA). Judge Amy Berman Jackson concluded that the plaintiffs met the evidentiary burden required to support their claim after finding personal and subject matter jurisdiction."

383,B,"Since entering office, President Trump has taken steps to restructure the U.S. military to raise the profile of both its cybersecurity and space capabilities. The administration has elevated U.S. Cyber Command to a Unified Combatant Command and has implemented policies signaling a shift toward a more offensive cybersecurity mindset. The administration has also begun the process of establishing a U.S. Space Command, as well as pursuing a plan to create a new branch of the military centered around space-related operations. Although this restructuring does not by itself implicate international law, it might do so if it results in operational changes."
384,F,"Finding a good match in the C-Suite is critical for maximizing business value and capitalizing on competitive advantages. This study analyzes the roles of controllers in organizational descriptions and executives' profiles, as they both define the position and craft the profession. This paper proposes a framework to describe and classify the existing controller types based on an extended review and description of the available literature. Then, using a clustering method based on the semisupervised k-means, we mapped a sample of 45 controllers to their dominant profile and contrasted individuals' characteristics against the companies' definitions of the role. This study reveals that the understanding of the types of controllers, which is usually presented as a dichotomy, may lead to mismatches between what is needed and what is performed. The clustering analysis reveals a significant mismatch between individuals and the organizations defining the role. The framework and clustering method could be used for multiple purposes, such as evaluating what type of controller an individual is or a company needs, which would improve recruitment processes to achieve better matches. The framework expands the identification of controllers from a dichotomy to a gradual classification and describes four controller profiles. This perspective further describes the role and validates the framework using data mining tools."
385,F,"The article aims to explain the reasons and the methods for evaluating the vitality of the family businesses with a focus on a country where family businesses were violently interrupted by forty years of the socialist regime. The intention is to find out, in connection with the vitality of family businesses, whether it is possible to define the factors that enabled the subsequent continuity of this type of business, for instance, the sector that is relevant to the region. The authors draw on a resource-based view as well as the specifics of the family-owned business in an institutional context. They comment on the behaviour of family business from three perspectives - legal, managerial and economic. The intention of knowledge/evaluation system presented is to find the weaknesses in the family business structures in the Czech Republic, which opens the opportunity for the succession process and the subsequent professionalization of their solutions. The methodology is presented in ten case studies. The results of the evaluation showed considerable compliance with those assumptions defined in the literature on those family businesses that continued uninterrupted."
386,F,"The impact of significant competition factors on the riskiness of business risk in the SMEs sector in the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic. The empirical research was constructed on the basis a questionnaire. The attitudes from 641 entrepreneurs from two countries were collected during the year 2018. The statistical hypotheses were evaluated using quantitative methods. The multiple linear regression models were used to evaluate the impact of the competitive environment and of the narrow business environment on the perception of the riskiness of business risk according to entrepreneurs. The conclusions ofthe research showed an interesting finding. The authors found that the competitive environment, as well as the narrower business environment, affects the perception of the riskiness of business risk. It has also been shown that my customers accept the prices of my products and services. This is the most important indicator of a competitive environment. The most important indicator of a narrower business environment is that my customers support me in doing business. The authors believe that the article has brought several interesting findings and new incentives for the further research and discussion regarding to the perception of enterprise risk not only in the selected countries this research."
387,F,"This study explores the relationship between positive emotions and protection-motivated behaviours by focusing on the mediating role of self-efficacy and the moderating role of information security awareness. Based on a sample of 215 full-time employees from various organizations in China, the results of hierarchical regression and moderated path analysis indicate that positive emotions positively influence protection-motivated behaviours, and self-efficacy partially mediates this relationship. In addition, information security awareness has a positive moderating effect on the relationships between positive emotions and self-efficacy and between self-efficacy and protection-motivated behaviours. Furthermore, the findings show that information security awareness has a positive moderating effect on the mediating effect of self-efficacy between positive emotions and protection-motivated behaviours. The theoretical and practical implications of these results, as well as directions for future research, are discussed."
388,F,"This paper aims at investigating military and demographic inter-linkages in the context of the Lithuanian sustainability. The investigation combines three important economic aspects such as demographic, military and sustainable development. The authors have revealed that demographic trends should be seen as a necessary conditions for ensuring the functioning of the military sector contributes to public security and sustainable development in general. Correlation and stepwise regression analysis, also Monte Carlo forecasting method have been applied for this purpose. Research results have revealed statistically significant interrelationship between military personnel as a share of total labour force and population growth rate, population median age, total fertility rate as well as birth rate. Moreover, Monte Carlo forecasting method allowed revealing for the next 10 years a steady slight increase in armed forces personnel, stable population growth rates, a rapid aging process and a slight decline of total fertility rate. Military and demographic estimations and future projections allow government to incorporate information into planning and sustainable development policy. The insights from this research may contribute to implementing the goals of sustainable development related to eradication of poverty, inequality, social exclusion, improvement in education, well-being and employment and tackling climate change."
389,F,"Bullying and harassment are the dark side of sport, not open to spectators and often ignored by coaches and leaders. 'therefore, the research aim is to identify prevalence of bullying and harassment in Lithuanian organized sport with regard to individual, combat and team sports, highlighting measures/actions used to manage these phenomena. Survey research uses quantitative research strategy. The study involved 1440 organized sports athletes representing all sports types. The prevalence of bullying actions with regard to separate type of sports was identified: in individual sports (9.8%), in combat sports (8.5%), and in team sports (7.3%). The analysis by four specific actions has shown that athletes experienced most of such actions in combat sports (20%); almost half less, in team sports (10.8%) and individual sports (10.1%). The results of the study show a lack of bullying and harassment intervention and of comprehensive complaint submission procedures, while coaches particularly often ignore athletes' negative behaviour. The article discusses managerial causes of bullying and harassment in the sports organization, presenting a holistic view of the phenomenon, including the forms of violence that have been little studied so far. This will help leaders to carry out prevention and intervention activities the specificity of which comes to prominence depending on the types of sports."
390,F,"This paper contributes to the academic debate on the pecking order theory and SMEs equity financing, in this equity financing gap. In order to address this problem, this study relies on the empirical design that is driven by the premises of the pecking order theory and distinguishes between the relevance of internal funds vs. external equity. The main aim of this study is to investigate whether the relevance of equity financing for European SMEs is driven by the country-specifics (captured by the clusters of the EU countries) and whether there are any other factors that may potentially explain the relevance of internal funds or external equity, with respect to SMEs performance and characteristics. For that purposes the SAFE survey data were used to run non-parametric and correlations analysis. The results have clearly indicated that there are statistically significant differences between the clusters of the EU countries (if we differentiate between core and peripheral EU countries in particular). It was also found that there is no unified pattern of the associations between the relevance of equity financing and SMEs performance and characteristics, thus these associations seem to be influenced by the country-specifics as well."
391,F,"The main aim of this paper is to investigate volatility spillover effects, the impact of past volatility on present market movements, the reaction to positive and negative news, among selected financial markets. The sample stock markets are geographically dispersed on different continents, respectively North America, Europe and Asia We also investigate whether selected emerging stock markets capture the volatility patterns of developed stock markets located in the same region. The empirical analysis is focused on seven developed stock market indices, i.e. IBEX35 (Spain), DJIA (USA), FTSE100 (UK), TSX Composite (Canada), NIKKEI225 (Japan), DAX (Germany), CAC40 (France) and five emerging stock market indices, i.e. BET (Romania), WIG20 (Poland), BSE (India), SSE Composite (China) and BUX (Hungary) from January 2000 to June 2018. The econometric framework includes symmetric and asymmetric GARCH models i.e. EGARCH and GJR which are performed in order to capture asymmetric volatility clustering, interdependence, correlations, financial integration and leptokurtosis. Symmetric and asymmetric GARCH models revealed that all selected financial markets are highly volatile, including the presence of leverage effect. The stock markets in Hungary, USA, Germany, India and Canada exhibit high positive volatility after global financial crisis."
392,F,"This study explores the risk-based effects of negative electronic word-of-mouth (neWOM) perception (financial and performance risks) on electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) credibility and purchase intention for promotion- and prevention-focused consumers. In this experimental study, a survey was conducted in which 344 people from Turkey participated. Automobiles were chosen as the subject of the survey because they are in the high-risk product category. The results from regression analysis show that the neWOM perception containing financial risk information plays a more significant role than the one containing performance risk in terms of the effect on eWOM credibility for both promotion- and prevention-focused consumers. Moreover, the neWOM containing performance risk has no effect on the eWOM credibility for promotion-focused consumers. When exposed to neWOM, the purchase intentions of both consumers are even more negatively affected by the neWOM information containing performance risk than the one with financial risk content The results and future predictions are discussed."
393,F,"Innovations represent the engine of the business and economic. This is particularly relevant to the traditional sectors such as forestry and forest-based industry that arc expected to play an important role in the future steps oriented towards meeting the sustainable development goals. The main aim of this study is to analyse the stakeholders' perceptions of the innovation trends in the forestry and forest-based sectors by using a Q-methodology. This research addressed three groups of respondents in Slovakia, whose task was to subjectively assess innovative trends in the forestry and forest-based sectors. Based on the results it can be concluded that the innovation trend in the forestry and forest-based sectors will be oriented towards the technological progress focused on the increasing efficiency of wood processing and increasing the usability of waste material as well as the trend of increasing development of innovations in the forest recreation services."
394,F,"The study presents the results of the impact of organizational culture on public relations in business organizations. The data were obtained from a survey of 415 respondents from 93 companies in Serbia. The following statistical methods were used: descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, regression analysis and hierarchical regression analysis. Some of the most important conclusions of the research follow: In most cases, the organizational culture dimensions have a statistically significant and positive influence on the communication models of public relations (CMPR) dimensions and the organization - public relations (OPR) dimensions; A favorable organizational culture (represented through the favorable values of the organizational culture dimensions) has a positive impact on two-way models of communication, especially the symmetrical model, as well as on most of the OPR dimensions. On the other hand, an unfavorable organizational culture encourages one-way communication and the organization's orientation solely for its own benefit; The Power Distance dimension acts in contrast to the other dimensions of organizational culture: high power distance impedes two-way communication and promotes the utility of the company, all of which causes public distrust and dissatisfaction."
395,F,"The study analyses the impact of country's governance factors on the financial behaviour and performance of financial intermediaries operating in European Union countries, by covering the period 2000-2017. Empirical evidence provided by the paper relies on a set of financial and political factors that has not been previously studied. Four indicators are jointly used as proxies for capturing the various dimensions of a country's good governance, while 21 financial indicators represent the alternative dependent variables meant to comprehensively depict the banking sector and capital market development. Each panel regression has been controlled for country's degree of economic development and its membership to OECD and euro-zone. The findings indicated that various dimensions of political factor caused different effects on financial sector features. Control of corruption, solid political and economic stability determine significant effects on most financial variables considered (almost two-thirds of the financial indicators considered). Even after controlling for the lagged effect of governance factors the main results hold, in that monitoring corruption, maintaining political stability and designing sound economic policies still have an impact on most financial indicators considered. Another interesting conclusion supported by the results is that not all political instability indicators are detrimental for banking and stock market functioning."
396,F,"Brexit became an important subject not only for academics but also for international institutions, research centers and consultancy companies, think tanks and independent experts. The aim of this article is to: (1) provide a general approach of the literature; (2) see how the effects of Brexit are explained in such short-term approach and how important are the economic issues in the debates; (3) identify directions for future research, arguing that a new field of study emerged. 'I he estimation of economic impact of Brexit has generated a reach literature in a short period, which identifies the main issues, rather than providing strong results and conclusions. In order to fill this gap, our paper provide a systematic review of the most important contributions and group them in four research directions: overall economic implications of Brexit; Brexit and trade; migration and labour market; financial issues and Brexit."
397,F,"The Belt and Road (B&R) Initiative receives enthusiastic response, the aim of which is to develop cooperative partnerships with countries along the routes and build a community of common destiny. So far, Chinese companies have invested in many different countries along the B&R. Generally, the investment decision making problems are characterized by high risk and uncertainty. Then how to make an appropriate investment decision will be a thorny issue. In this paper, probabilistic hesitant fuzzy set (PHFS) is used for handling uncertainty in multiple attribute decision making (MADM), and the criteria importance through intercriteria correlation (CRITIC) approach is extended to obtain attribute weights, no matter whether the weight information is incompletely known or not. Considering that the existing probabilistic hesitant fuzzy distance measures fail to meet the condition of distance measure, a new distance between PHFSs is proposed and applied to investment decision making for countries along the B&R. In the last, comparative analyses are performed to illustrate the advantages of the presented approach."
398,F,"The aim of the study in this paper is to show how the performance of banks can be evaluated by ranking them based on Balanced Scorecard (BSC) and Multicriteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods. Nowadays, assessing the performance of companies is a vital work for finding their weaknesses and strengths. The banking sector is an important area in the service sector. Many people want to know which bank performs best when entrusting their money to them. For assessing the performance of banks, BSC can be used. 'I his method helps to translate strategic issues to meaningful insights for the respective financial institutions. After that, the banks will be ranked based on performance indicators by the Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) method. Because this method is based on a decision matrix, weights are required. To find such weights, the Step-wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) method is applied. The results show that the International Bank of Colombia has a much better performance than other Colombian banks. Besides, further insights regarding the evaluation process based on BSC, SWARA, and WASPAS are obtained."
399,F,"This study conducts a dynamic rolling comparison between the Pareto/NBD model (parametric model) and machine learning algorithms (observation-driven models) in customer base analysis, which the literature has not comprehensively investigated before. The aim is to find the comparative edge of these two approaches under customer base analysis and to define the implementation timing of these two paradigms. This research utilizes Pareto/NBD (Abe) as representative of Buy-Till-You-Die (BTYD) models in order to compete with machine learning algorithms and presents the following results. (1) The parametric model wins in transaction frequency prediction, whereas it loses in inactivity prediction. (2) The BTYD model outperforms machine learning in inactivity prediction when the customer base is active, performs better in an inactive customer base when competing with Poisson regression, and wins in a short-term active customer base when competing with a neural network algorithm in transaction frequency prediction. (3) The parametric model benefits more from a short calibration length and a long holdout/target period, which exhibit uncertainty.

400,F,"There is a gap in literature as to how multidimensional satisfaction fits into a nomological network with continuity, coordination and cooperation. Furthermore, most studies focusing on these constructs are limited to a buyer perspective. The objective of this study is to fill this gap by testing a model whereby continuity, coordination and cooperation are regarded as mediators between economic and non-economic satisfaction specifically within business-sales representative relationships, thereby establishing a foundation to assess the structural properties between economic satisfaction and non-economic satisfaction within a business sales context. Managerial implications offered in the paper were discussed and the practical relevance and implementation thereof validated by experienced sales directors. This study contributes by revealing that continuity, coordination and cooperation to some extent mediates separately as well as cumulatively the relationship between economic satisfaction and non-economic satisfaction within a business sales context. Subsequently, it contributes by extending our understanding in relation to existing theory and previous studies of business relationships to a business sales perspective."
401,F,"In this paper, we fill the gap in the literature by identifying a negative relationship between fuel ethanol consumption and CO2 emissions, building on a sample of 17 European countries covering seven years, from 2010 to 2016. Based on a Panel Smooth Transition Regression approach we show that countries with high levels of income inequality have difficulties in avoiding environmental degradation by promoting policies and regulations for more intense use of biofuels. Furthermore, we bring strong empirical evidence suggesting that biofuels could be an alternative in the future to reducing CO2 emissions. In our opinion, this non-linear analysis could provide the scientific basis for authorities, especially the European Commission to promote environmental policies to a specific country with different levels of carbon emissions rather than to the entire group."
402,F,"The aim of this article is to prove the key role of the structure of the research sample used for accuracy determining on the accuracy of bankruptcy models. The creators of these models report the accuracy usually in the range of 60 to 90%. The authors of this article claim that these values are inaccurate and misleading. The real I. type error should be detected on a sample where obvious features of financial default were eliminated. The research tested more than 1200 of thriving businesses and also 270 businesses in future bankruptcy. The research has determined real current accuracy of selected three bankruptcy models on the standard sample of Czech businesses amounting 67.77%, 62.27% and 74.36%. This confirmed hypothesis no. 1, which says that actual accuracy of bankruptcy model is lower than original accuracy indicated by model makers. An accuracy of 58.70%, 61.59% and 65.94% was measured on a sample where businesses with obvious features of financial distress were eliminated. Due to the modification of the test sample, the order of accuracy has changed. This confirmed hypothesis no. 2. The Index of Karas and Reznakova reached the highest overall accuracy of 80.31% including incorrect prediction of bankruptcy also."
403,G,"Objective: The aim of the study was to assess the healthy migrant effect in relation to oral health among adults in England. Study design: This is a secondary data analysis of a nationally representative survey. Methods: Data from 13,373 adults of Irish, black Caribbean, Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Chinese ethnicity, who participated in the Health Survey for England, were analysed. The proportions of edentate and dentate adults with toothache in the last 6 months in first- and second-generation migrants within each ethnic group were compared with those in the white British (reference group) ethnic group in logistic regression models after adjusting for demographic factors and socio-economic position. Among first-generation migrants, the associations of age at arrival and length of residence with each oral health outcome were assessed in logistic regression models after adjusting for sociodemographic factors. Results: Compared with white British migrants, first-generation black Caribbean (odds ratio [OR]: 1.42) and second-generation Pakistani (OR: 3.16) migrants had higher odds of being edentulous, whereas first-generation Indian (OR: 0.62), Pakistani (OR: 0.62), Bangladeshi (OR: 0.41) and Chinese (OR: 0.49) migrants had lower odds. Among dentate adults, second-generation Irish (OR: 1.51) migrants, first- and second-generation black Caribbean (OR: 1.61 and 1.54, respectively) migrants, first-generation Indian (OR: 1.24) migrants and second-generation Pakistani (OR: 1.34) migrants had higher odds of having toothache in the past 6 months, whereas second- generation Bangladeshi (OR: 0.51) migrants had lower odds than white British. Age at arrival and length of residence were positively associated with being edentulous among first-generation black Caribbean, Pakistani and Bangladeshi migrants. Conclusion: Evidence on the healthy migrant effect was mixed, with more consistent findings seen for edentulousness among Asian groups. Black Caribbean migrants were generally the ethnic group with the worst oral health when compared with white British. (c) 2019 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

404,G,"Objectives: The aim of the study is to examine what types of injuries that seriously injured pedestrians and cyclists received in urban road spaces from 2003 to 2017 in the Swedish region of Vastmanland, when the road safety policy Vision Zero was implemented. Study design: This is a cross-sectional data annually collected over a period of fifteen years. Methods: Data from health care for 403 seriously injured pedestrians and cyclists were retrieved from the registry STRADA (Swedish Traffic Accident Data Acquisition) and cross-referenced with the National Road Database to see if any Vision Zero measures had previously been implemented at the crash location. The study includes injuries from both single and multiple crashes on roads, pavements, and tracks for walking and cycling (road space). Statistical analysis was performed by descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and multiple logistic regression analyses. Results: Pedestrians were seriously injured in lower extremities more than cyclists, whereas more cyclists were seriously injured in the head. During the period, pedestrians. head injuries decreased significantly, but injuries in lower extremities increased significantly. In addition, for cyclists, there was a shift from decreased probability of head injuries to increased probability of injuries in lower extremities related to increased age. For pedestrians, pavements/tracks were associated with a decreased probability of a majority of injury outcomes but for cyclists only for severe injury outcomes. Conclusions: From 2003 to 2017, there was a shift among seriously injured pedestrians, with head injuries decreasing and injuries in lower extremities increasing. This shift was probably related to an ageing population in the region, given that increased age among both pedestrians and cyclists was associated with a decreased probability of head injuries but increased probability of injuries in lower extremities. On Vision Zero roads, there was a decreased probability of pedestrians receiving serious injury to more than one bodily region. An increased number of older people combined with policies for more active mobility such as walking and cycling are a challenge for road authorities in urban areas. (c) 2019 The Authors.

405,G,"Objectives: Intergenerational educational mobility can be particularly relevant for smoking because it implies moving from individuals' family background to a new position in the social hierarchy. Existing research, however, does not provide an answer as to how the process of mobility, per se, is associated with the likelihood of smoking. Study design: We used cross-nationally comparable survey data for 20 countries collected within the health module of the European Social Survey in 2014. The analytical sample consisted of 22,336 respondents aged 25-64 years. Methods: Smoking was operationalized by daily and occasional smoking, while the intergenerational educational mobility variable was derived from a comparison of respondents' and their parents' highest levels of educational attainment. We employed diagonal reference models to examine the association of intergenerational educational mobility and smoking. Results: In the country- and age-adjusted analysis, intergenerational downward mobility was associated with odds ratios of 1.34 (CI95 1.07, 1.68) and 1.61 (CI95 1.34, 1.93) for smoking, respectively, among men and women. Intergenerational upward mobility, on the other hand, was negatively associated with smoking but only among women. Conclusion: Our findings provide new evidence that the process of intergenerational educational mobility is associated with individuals' likelihood of smoking and that this effect cannot be explained by conventional covariates of smoking.

406,G,"Objectives: The objective of the study was to clarify the reasons why students who graduated from a Master's programme in international health were joining the programme. Another objective was to document how the Master's degree had influenced the careers of the graduates. Study design: An online survey of students who graduated from a Master's programme in international health, including oral science, between 2010 and 2015. Method: The study used an anonymous questionnaire that contained 28 items. Topics included information such as demographics, questions about the reasons for joining the Master's programme and the benefits and influence of the programme on the career of the students. Results: Of the 102 alumni who were invited to participate, 70 responded. The response rate was 69%, and we have no information about the non-responders. The results showed that the main reasons for students enrolling in the programme were to improve their competence and develop their career. Around 63% of the respondents reported that the programme had increased their competencies in the jobs they had, whereas 24% answered that their increased qualifications had enabled them to acquire new positions. Thus successfully completing the programme had a positive influence on the graduates' careers in international health. Most of the graduates, who were working, were typically employed at hospitals and universities. Several graduates had proceeded to gain further qualifications by now being enrolled in a PhD programme. Conclusions: Among the 70% of responders in this survey, the master's programme had benefitted the alumni and the programme had fulfilled their expectations. The programme had a positive influence on the alumni in areas such as increased competency, development of their careers, new positions and better salaries. (c) 2020 The Authors.

407,G,"Objectives: The American state of Hawaii presents a tuberculosis (TB) burden more consistent with that of the Philippines and the Pacific Islands than that with the United States (US) or Europe. This study seeks to determine if the genetic families of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) that are prevalent in Hawaii display differences in host demographics that may be of use for TB control in Hawaii and the Pacific. Study design: This retrospective study was conducted by analyzing data from the Hawaii State Department of Health to investigate the demographics associated with the Beijing (global lineage 2) and Manila (lineage 1) families of Mtb in Hawaii. Methods: Deidentified records of all culture-positive TB cases reported by the Hawaii State Department of Health Tuberculosis Control Program from 2004 to 2016 were analyzed to identify lineage-specific demographic differences and trends. Patients' countries of origin, age, sex, and time in the US before TB diagnosis were included in this analysis. Results: Manila family isolates were found to predominantly enter Hawaii through Filipino immigrants, whereas Beijing family isolates originated from a diverse set of countries. Both families exhibited significant differences in age and sex demographics. In addition, Manila family cases presented from patients with significantly longer average time of residence in the US than non-Manila cases, whereas Beijing family cases presented from patients with significantly shorter time of residence in the US than non-Beijing cases. Conclusions: Both the Beijing and Manila families of Mtb demonstrated demographic differences in Hawaii that may prove important for improving TB control and surveillance policy in Hawaii and throughout the Pacific. Areas with heavy Filipino immigration may benefit from directing more resources toward screening and education efforts for middle-aged men and those who have resided in the country longer, whereas other areas of the Pacific should consider a younger and more sex-balanced allocation. Specific to the US and Hawaii, effective screening of youths emigrating from the Compact of Free Association states remains vital. (C) 2020 The Authors.

408,G,"Objectives: To investigate ethnic differences in falls and road traffic injuries (RTIs) in Scotland. Study design: A retrospective cohort of 4.62 million people, linking the Scottish Census 2001, with self-reported ethnicity, to hospitalisation and death records for 2001-2013. Methods: We selected cases with International Classification of Diseases-10 diagnostic codes for falls and RTIs. Using Poisson regression, age-adjusted risk ratios (RRs, multiplied by 100 as percentages) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by sex for 10 ethnic groups with the White Scottish as reference. We further adjusted for country of birth and socio-economic status (SES). Results: During about 49 million person-years, there were 275,995 hospitalisations or deaths from fall-related injuries and 43,875 from RTIs. Compared with the White Scottish, RRs for falls were higher in most White and Mixed groups, e.g., White Irish males (RR: 131; 95% CI: 122-140) and Mixed females (126; 112-143), but lower in Pakistani males (72; 64-81) and females (72; 63-82) and African females (79; 63-99). For RTIs, RRs were higher in other White British males (161; 147-176) and females (156; 138-176) and other White males (119; 104-137) and females (143; 121-169) and lower in Pakistani females (74; 57-98). The ethnic variations differed by road user type, with few cases among non-White motorcyclists and non-White female cyclists. The RRs were minimally altered by adjustment for country of birth or SES. Conclusion: We found important ethnic variations in injuries owing to falls and RTIs, with generally lower risks in non-White groups. Culturally related differences in behaviour offer the most plausible explanation, including variations in alcohol use. The findings do not point to the need for new interventions in Scotland at present. However, as the ethnic mix of each country is unique, other countries could benefit from similar data linkage-based research. (C) 2020 The Authors.

409,G,"Objectives: Recent trends of 'vaccine hesitancy' have resulted in calls for public health campaigns to improve immunisation uptake to World Health Organisation (WHO) targets. One potential strategy to improve uptake is to offer opportunistic vaccination to those hospital in-patients who have missed them. We aimed to evaluate parental and staff attitudes about introducing such a service for hospitalised children. Study design: Cross sectional questionnaire-based design. Methods: We developed and distributed a questionnaire for parents/guardians of paediatric inpatients aged 5 years and under, and a questionnaire for frontline paediatric staff (including medical, nursing and allied health professionals). Vaccination rates were assessed through discussion with parents and by reviewing the personal child health record. Results: One-hundred families and 100 paediatric staff participated. Local vaccination rates were significantly below the WHO target (P < 0.001), particularly for the Bacille Calmette-Guerine (BCG) vaccination (P = 0.001). Both parents (89/100, 89%) and staff (87/100, 87%) regarded inpatient opportunistic vaccination acceptable. Parents of children with chronic disease reported a potentially higher rate of missed vaccinations, stating reasons of frequent illness and inpatient stays. The majority of staff (81/95, 85.3%) would be willing to support inpatient vaccination if appropriately trained. A significant minority had reservations. Conclusions: Opportunistic vaccination is a strategy deemed acceptable by the majority of parents and staff. Children with chronic disease would especially benefit from opportunistic inpatient immunisation. In order to facilitate this, improved digital access to primary care vaccination records and investment in staff training, education and support would be required.

410,G,"Objective: Informed consent (IC) principles are often overlooked aspects in debates about national screening programs. This short communication examines the Danish approach to IC in decision-making about screening participation. Study design: A descriptive approach is adopted in linking present screening practices with Danish regulation about IC and international ethical principles. Methods: To ascertain the extent to which screening procedures come up to IC requirements, the article adopts a review approach by examining relevant Danish national legislation including ministerial orders as well as international ethical codes. Results: The article finds that, although Danish legislation as well as international IC principles generally stipulates a decision-making process requiring oral communication, current procedures largely rely on one-way communication through written information available from leaflets, web sites, etc. Screening programs seem to have established no general formula to qualify healthcare users' understanding of data underlying their choice whether to be screened. Conclusion: The deviance from common IC principles may reduce healthcare quality, pose a safety problem, and challenge healthcare users' ability to exercise autonomy.

412,G,"Objective: To evaluate distribution of hospital-level cancer diagnosis and treatment technologies along dimensions of racial residential segregation. Study design: Cross-sectional analysis of residential segregation and availability of technologies associated with cancer diagnosis and treatment. Methods: American Hospital Association data were merged with American Community Survey data, and hospital was the unit of analysis. Isolation index and Atkinson's index were calculated for racial residential segregation for the census tract in which the hospital is located based on the composite census block groups. Logistic regression was used to model presence of cancer technologies as a function of percent below poverty (scaled 1-10), number of neighboring hospitals, and rural status. Results: Segregation measured by isolation index was associated with the availability of some technologies, independent of percentage below 125% poverty line, number of neighboring hospitals, and rural status. Diagnostic cancer technologies, such as CT scan (odds ratio [OR] = 0.928, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.894, 0.964), ultrasound (OR = 0.961, 95% CI: 0.927, 0.997), mammography (OR = 0.943, 95% CI: 0.914, 0.974), optical colonoscopy (OR = 0.932, 95% CI: 0.904, 0.961), and full-field digital mammography (OR = 0.948, 95% CI: 0.920, 0.977) and therapeutic cancer technology such as chemo therapy (OR = 0.963, 95% CI: 0.934, 0.992) appear to be less available in neighborhoods with higher isolation index. However, when segregation is measured by Atkinson's index, CT scan (OR = 1.064, 95% CI: 1.010, 1.121), ultrasound (OR = 1.087, 95% CI: 1.035,1.141), mammography (OR = 1.094, 95% CI: 1.049,1.141), and optical colonoscopy (OR = 1.053, 95% CI: 1.012, 1.095) are more available in neighborhoods with higher Atkinson's index. Conclusion: These results suggest that cancer diagnostic capabilities in segregated areas are in the pathway between residential segregation and cancer treatment process, and future studies should evaluate individual-level associations.

413,G,"Objective: In the context of universal health insurance coverage, this study aimed to determine whether urban-rural inequality still exists in preventive health care (PHC) amongst children in Taiwan. Study design: Prospective cohort study. Methods: A total of 184,117 mothers and their children born in 2009 were identified as the study cohort. The number of children born in urban, satellite and rural areas was 40,176, 57,565 and 86,805, respectively. All children were followed for 7 years, before which a total of seven times PHC were provided by Taiwan's National Health Insurance (NHI) programme. Ordinal logistic regression models were used to associate urbanisation level with the frequency of PHC utilisation. Stratified analyses were further performed in accordance with the children's birth weight and the mothers' birthplace. Results: Children from satellite areas had higher utilisation for the first four scheduled PHC visits. Children living in urban areas received more PHC for the fifth and sixth scheduled visits. Compared with those from rural areas, children in satellite areas exhibited a small but significant increase in odds in PHC utilisation, with a covariate-adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 1.04 and 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.02 -1.06. By contrast, no significant difference was observed between rural and urban areas (aOR = 1.01). Further stratified analyses suggest more evident urban-rural difference in PHC utilisation amongst children with low birth weight and foreign-born mothers. Conclusions: Given a universal health insurance coverage and embedded mechanisms in increasing the availability of healthcare resources in Taiwan, a slight urban-rural difference is observed in PHC utilisation amongst children. Hence, sociodemographic inequality in utilisation of PHC still exists. This issue should be addressed through policy intervention. (C) 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health.

414,A,"Most psychiatric disorders emerge during childhood and adolescence. This is also a period that coincides with the brain undergoing substantial growth and reorganisation. However, it remains unclear how a heightened vulnerability to psychiatric disorder relates to this brain maturation. Here, we propose 'developmental computational psychiatry' as a framework for linking brain maturation to cognitive development. We argue that through modelling some of the brain's fundamental cognitive computations, and relating them to brain development, we can bridge the gap between brain and cognitive development. This in turn can lead to a richer understanding of the ontogeny of psychiatric disorders. We illustrate this perspective with examples from reinforcement learning and dopamine function. Specifically, we show how computational modelling deepens an understanding of how cognitive processes, such as reward learning, effort learning, and social learning might go awry in psychiatric disorders. Finally, we sketch the promises and limitations of a developmental computational psychiatry."
415,A,"In primary analyses, dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) was associated with greater reduction in self-harm during treatment than individual/group supportive therapy (IGST). The objective of this paper was to examine predictors and moderators of treatment outcomes for suicidal adolescents who participated in a randomized controlled trial evaluating DBT and IGST. Adolescents (N = 173) were included in the intent-to-treat sample and randomized to receive 6 months of DBT or IGST. Potential baseline predictors and moderators were identified within four categories: demographics, severity markers, parental psychopathology, and psychosocial variables. Primary outcomes were suicide attempts (SA) and nonsuicidal self-injury evaluated at baseline, midtreatment (3 months), and end of treatment (6 months) via the Suicide Attempt and Self-Injury Interview (Psychological Assessment, 18, 2006, 303). For each moderator or predictor, a generalized linear mixed model was conducted to examine main and interactive effects of treatment and the candidate variable on outcomes. Adolescents with higher family conflict, more extensive self-harm histories, and more externalizing problems produced on average more reduction on SH frequency from baseline to post-treatment. Adolescents meeting BPD diagnosis were more likely to have high SH frequency at post-treatment. Analyses indicated significant moderation effects for emotion dysregulation on NSSI and SH. DBT was associated with better rates of improvement compared to IGST for adolescents with higher baseline emotion dysregulation and those whose parents reported greater psychopathology and emotion dysregulation. A significant moderation effect for ethnicity on SA over the treatment period was observed, where DBT produced better rate of improvement compared to IGST for Hispanic/Latino individuals. These findings may help to inform salient treatment targets and guide treatment planning. Adolescents that have high levels of family conflict, externalizing problems, and increased level of severity markers demonstrated the most change in self-harm behaviors over the course of treatment and benefitted from both treatment interventions. Those with higher levels of emotion dysregulation and parent psychopathology may benefit more from the DBT."
416,A,"Signs of autism are present in the first 2 years of life, but the average age of diagnosis lags far behind. Instruments that improve detection of autism risk in infancy are needed. This study developed and tested the psychometric properties of a novel video-based approach to detecting ASD in infancy. A prospective longitudinal study of children at elevated or lower risk for autism spectrum disorder was conducted. Participants were 76 infants with an older sibling with ASD and 37 infants with no known family history of autism. The Video-referenced Infant Rating System for Autism (VIRSA) is a web-based application that presents pairs of videos of parents and infants playing together and requires forced-choice judgments of which video is most similar to the child being rated. Parents rated participants on the VIRSA at 6, 9, 12, and 18 months of age. We examined split-half and test-retest reliability; convergent and discriminant validity; and sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive value for concurrent and 36-month ASD diagnoses. The VIRSA demonstrated satisfactory reliability and convergent and discriminant validity. VIRSA ratings were significantly lower for children ultimately diagnosed with ASD than children with typical development by 12 months of age. VIRSA scores at 18 months identified all children diagnosed with ASD at that age, as well as 78% of children diagnosed at 36 months. This study represents an initial step in the development of a novel video-based approach to detection of ASD in infancy. The VIRSA's psychometric properties were promising when used by parents with an older affected child, but still must be tested in community samples with no family history of ASD. If results are replicated, then the VIRSA's low-burden, web-based format has the potential to reduce disparities in communities with limited access to screening."
417,C,"About 35 years ago a class of galaxies with unusually strong Balmer absorption lines and weak emission lines was discovered in distant galaxy clusters(1,2). These objects, alternatively referred to as post-starburst, E+A or k+a galaxies, are now known to occur in all environments and at all redshifts(3-7), with many exhibiting compact morphologies and low-surface brightness features indicative of past galaxy mergers(3,8). They are commonly thought to represent galaxies that are transitioning from blue to red sequence, making them critical to our understanding of the origins of galaxy bimodality(9-14). However, recent observational studies have questioned this simple interpretation(15-18). From observations alone, it is challenging to disentangle the different mechanisms that lead to the quenching of star formation in galaxies. Here we present examples of three different evolutionary pathways that lead to galaxies with strong Balmer absorption lines in the Evolution and Assembly of Galaxies and their Environments (EAGLE) simulation(19,20): classical blue -> red quenching, blue -> blue cycle and red -> red rejuvenation. The first two are found in both post-starburst galaxies and galaxies with truncated star formation. Each pathway is consistent with scenarios hypothesized for observational samples(2,15,18,21,22). The fact that 'post-starburst' signatures can be attained via various evolutionary channels explains the diversity of observed properties, and lends support to the idea that slower quenching channels are important at low redshift(23,24)."
418,A,"Knowing that your parent or caregiver will be there for you in times of emotional need and distress is a core aspect of the human experience of feeling loved and being securely attached. In contrast, an insecure attachment pattern is found in many antisocial youth and is related to less sensitive caregiving. Such youth are often distrustful of adults and authority figures, and are at high risk of poor outcomes. As they become adults, they require extensive health, social and economic support, costing society ten times more than their well-adjusted peers. However, it is not known whether insecure attachment itself is associated with higher costs in at-risk youth, independently of potential confounders, nor whether cost differences are already beginning to emerge early in adolescence. Sample: A total of 174 young people followed up aged 9-17 years (mean 12.1, SD 1.8): 85 recruited with moderate antisocial behaviour (80th percentile) from a school screen aged 4-6 years; 89 clinically referred with very high antisocial behaviour (98th percentile) aged 3-7 years. Measures: Costs by detailed health economic and service-use interview; attachment security to mother and father from interview; diagnostic interviews for oppositional and conduct problems; self-reported delinquent behaviour. Costs were greater for youth insecurely attached to their mothers (secure 6,743 pound per year, insecure 10,199 pound, p = .001) and more so to fathers (secure 1,353 pound, insecure 13,978 pound, p < .001). These differences remained significant (mother p = .019, father p < .001) after adjusting for confounders, notably family income and education, intelligence and antisocial behaviour severity. Attachment insecurity is a significant predictor of public cost in at-risk youth, even after accounting for covariates. Since adolescent attachment security is influenced by caregiving quality earlier in childhood, these findings add support to the public health case for early parenting interventions to improve child outcomes and reduce the financial burden on society."
419,A,"Objective To examine development of bipolar spectrum disorders (BPSD) and other disorders in prospectively followed children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Method In the Longitudinal Assessment of Manic Symptoms (LAMS) study, 531 of 685 children age 6-12 (most selected for scores > 12 on General Behavior Inventory 10-item Mania scale) had ADHD, 112 with BPSD, and 419 without. With annual assessments for 8 years, retention averaged 6.2 years. Chi-square analyses compared rate of new BPSD and other comorbidity between those with versus without baseline ADHD and between retained versus resolved ADHD diagnosis. Cox regression tested factors influencing speed of BPSD onset. Of 419 with baseline ADHD but not BPSD, 52 (12.4%) developed BPSD, compared with 16 of 110 (14.5%) without either baseline diagnosis. Those who developed BPSD had more nonmood comorbidity over the follow-up than those who did not develop BPSD (p = .0001). Of 170 who still had ADHD at eight-year follow-up (and not baseline BPSD), 26 (15.3%) had developed BPSD, compared with 16 of 186 (8.6%) who had ADHD without BPSD at baseline but lost the ADHD diagnosis (chi(2) = 3.82, p = .051). There was no statistical difference in whether ADHD persisted or not across new BPSD subtypes (chi(2) = 1.62, p = .446). Of those who developed BPSD, speed of onset was not significantly related to baseline ADHD (p = .566), baseline anxiety (p = .121), baseline depression (p = .185), baseline disruptive behavior disorder (p = .184), age (B = -.11 p = .092), maternal mania (p = .389), or paternal mania (B = .73, p = .056). Those who started with both diagnoses had more severe symptoms/impairment than those with later developed BPSD and reported having ADHD first. In a cohort selected for symptoms of mania at age 6-12, baseline ADHD was not a significant prospective risk factor for developing BPSD. However, persistence of ADHD may marginally mediate risk of BPSD, and early comorbidity of both diagnoses increases severity/impairment."
420,A,"Impairment of executive function (EF), the goal-directed regulation of thoughts, actions, and emotions, drives negative outcomes and is common across neurodevelopmental disorders including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A primary challenge to its amelioration is heterogeneity in symptom expression within and across disorders. Parsing this heterogeneity is necessary to attain diagnostic precision, a goal of the NIMH Research Domain Criteria Initiative. We aimed to identify transdiagnostic subtypes of EF that span the normal to impaired spectrum and establish their predictive and neurobiological validity. Community detection was applied to clinical parent-report measures in 8-14-year-old children with and without ADHD and ASD from two independent cohorts (discovery N = 320; replication N = 692) to identify subgroups with distinct behavioral profiles. Support vector machine (SVM) classification was used to predict subgroup membership of unseen cases. Preliminary neurobiological validation was obtained with existing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data on a subsample (N = 84) by testing hypotheses about sensitivity of EF subgroups versus DSM categories. We observed three transdiagnostic EF subtypes characterized by behavioral profiles that were defined by relative weakness in: (a) flexibility and emotion regulation; (b) inhibition; and (c) working memory, organization, and planning. The same tripartite structure was also present in the typically developing children. SVM trained on the discovery sample and tested on the replication sample classified subgroup membership with 77.0% accuracy. Split-half SVM classification on the combined sample (N = 1,012) yielded 88.9% accuracy (this SVM is available for public use). As hypothesized, frontal-parietal engagement was better distinguished by EF subtype than DSM diagnosis and the subgroup characterized with inflexibility failed to modulate right IPL activation in response to increased executive demands. The observed transdiagnostic subtypes refine current diagnostic nosology and augment clinical decision-making for personalizing treatment of executive dysfunction in children."
421,A,"Research trials of early intervention (EI) programs for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) generally demonstrate medium-to-large gains, on average, compared with """"treatment as usual,"""" in different developmental domains. Almost all children with ASD receive their treatment through community-based services, however, and studies suggest that evidence-based interventions rarely make their way into community practice. Understanding the effectiveness of community-based EI and factors associated with these effects is the first step in developing strategies for wide-scale implementation of effective EI. Studies of community-based EI for children with ASD were identified through a systematic search. Changes in cognitive, communication, social, and adaptive functioning from pre-treatment to post-treatment were assessed using standardized mean gain scores. Effect sizes were estimated using random effects models. Moderators of interest included type of community EI program, year of publication, intervention duration, and sample selection. Moderator effects were assessed using analysis of variance of mixed-effects models and meta-regression analyses. Forty-six groups from 33 studies met inclusion criteria (1,713 participants, mean age 37.4 months, 81.1% male). There were small but statistically significant gains in each of the four domains. Hedges's g ranged from 0.21 for adaptive behavior to 0.32 for communication outcomes, after removing outliers and correcting for publication bias. EI programs associated with universities and hospitals were superior, on average, to other community EI programs for cognitive and adaptive behavior outcomes. Intervention duration was negatively associated with effect sizes for communication and adaptive behavior outcomes. These results indicate that there remains a large gap between outcomes observed in community settings and those reported in efficacy trials."
422,A,"The study examined developmental trajectories of prosocial behaviours, internalising and externalising behaviour problems in children with intellectual disabilities (ID) between pre-school and middle childhood. Method Growth models examined the best-fitting trajectories for internalising and externalising behaviour problems, as well as prosocial behaviours, in 555 children with ID between the ages of three and 11 years from the UK Millennium Cohort Study. Models were also fitted to examine the association of child outcomes with time-varying maternal psychological distress and life satisfaction. Finally, models were extended to compare trajectories with typically developing children. Externalising behaviour problems and prosocial behaviours generally improved, whereas internalising problems did not change systematically over time. A cubic trend indicated a slowing down of improvement between ages 5 and 7 for prosocial behaviours and externalising problems. Maternal psychological distress positively co-varied with internalising and externalising behaviour problems over time. Life satisfaction was not related to changes in child behaviours over time. Compared to behavioural trajectories in typical development, intercepts were worse and trajectories also differed in the ID group. Over an 8-year period, externalising behaviour problems and prosocial behaviours of children with ID tended to improve. These behavioural improvements slowed between five and seven years, possibly coinciding with school-related environmental changes. Children with ID significantly differ from children with typical development in both the initial level of difficulties (exhibiting higher externalising and internalising behaviours, and lower prosocial behaviours) and subsequent development as they age, showing comparatively lower decreases in both externalising and internalising behaviours, and lower increases in prosocial behaviours. Findings also highlight the significant role of maternal mental health problems in the trajectory of child behaviour problems."
423,A,"Interventions have been developed to promote the development of secure and organized attachments during early childhood among children who have experienced early adversity, yet little is known about whether the effects of these early interventions are sustained beyond 12 months postintervention. The current study examined whether receiving the Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-Up (ABC) intervention during infancy led to improvements in perceived attachment security in middle childhood among 100 Child Protective Services (CPS)-referred children. Children and parents were randomized to receive ABC or a control intervention during infancy. Children completed the Kerns Security Scale at age nine (M-age = 9.46, SD = 0.36). (Trial Registry Name: Intervening Early with Neglected Children; Registry ID: NCT02093052; URL for registry: ). Children whose parents received ABC reported higher levels of attachment security on the Kerns Security Scale at age nine than children whose parents had received the control intervention, t(98) = 2.31, p = .023, d = 0.49. Findings underscore the long-term benefits of intervening early to promote caregiving quality among at-risk families and demonstrate the efficacy of a brief 10-session intervention in promoting attachment security over the span of eight years in a sample of CPS-referred children."
424,A,"Studies of U.S. and European samples demonstrate that parental warmth and behavioral control predict child internalizing behaviors and vice versa. However, these patterns have not been researched in other cultures. This study investigates associations between parent warmth and control and three child-reported internalizing behavior clusters to examine this question. Data from 12 cultural groups in 9 countries were used to investigate prospective bidirectional associations between parental warmth and control, and three child-reported internalizing behavior types: withdrawn/depressed, anxious/depressed, and somatic problems. Multiple-group structural equation modeling was used to analyze associations in children followed from ages 8 to 12. Parent warmth and control effects were most pervasive on child-reported withdrawn/depressed problems, somewhat pervasive on anxious/depressed problems and least pervasive on somatic problems. Additionally, parental warmth, as opposed to control, was more consistently associated with child-reported internalizing problems across behavior clusters. Child internalizing behavior effects on parental warmth and control appeared ubiquitously across cultures, and behaviors, but were limited to ages 8-10. Most effects were pancultural, but culture-specific effects emerged at ages 9-10 involving the associations between parent warmth and withdrawn/depressed and somatic behaviors. Effects of parent warmth and control appear stronger on some types of child-reported internalizing behaviors. Associations are especially strong with regard to parental warmth across cultures, and culture-specific effects may be accounted for by cultural normativeness of parent warmth and child-reported somatic symptoms. Child internalizing behavior effects on subsequent parenting are common across cultures."
425,A,"DNA methylation (DNAm) has been implicated in the biology of sleep. Yet, how DNAm patterns across the genome relate to different sleep outcomes, and whether these associations overlap with mental health is currently unknown. Here, we investigated associations of DNAm with sleep and mental health in a pediatric population. This cross-sectional study included 465 10-year-old children (51.3% female) from the Generation R Study. Genome-wide DNAm levels were measured using the Illumina 450K array (peripheral blood). Sleep problems were assessed from self-report and mental health outcomes from maternal questionnaires. Wrist actigraphy was used in 188 11-year-old children to calculate sleep duration and midpoint sleep. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was used to identify highly comethylated DNAm 'modules', which were tested for associations with sleep and mental health outcomes. We identified 64 DNAm modules, one of which associated with sleep duration after covariate and multiple testing adjustment. This module included CpG sites spanning 9 genes on chromosome 17, including MAPT - a key regulator of Tau proteins in the brain involved in neuronal function - as well as genes previously implicated in sleep duration. Follow-up analyses suggested that DNAm variation in this region is under considerable genetic control and shows strong blood-brain concordance. DNAm modules associated with sleep did not overlap with those associated with mental health. We identified one DNAm region associated with sleep duration, including genes previously reported by recent GWAS studies. Further research is warranted to examine the functional role of this region and its longitudinal association with sleep."
426,A,"The establishment of Child Friendly Spaces (CFSs) has become a widespread intervention targeting protection and support for displaced children in humanitarian contexts. There is a lack of evidence of impact of these interventions with respect to both short-term outcomes and longer-term developmental trajectories. We collected data from caregivers of Congolese refugee children residing in Rwamwanja Refugee Settlement at three timepoints. To assess short-term impact of CFSs, we compared indicators assessed shortly after refugees' arrival (baseline, T1) and endline (T2, three to six months after CFS implementation) amongst 430 CFS attenders and 161 nonattenders. Follow-up assessments after the end of CFS programming were conducted 18 months post-baseline (T3) with caregivers of 249 previous CFS attenders and 77 CFS nonattenders. In the short-term, attendance at CFSs was associated with better maintenance of psychosocial well-being (PSWB; beta = 2.093, p < .001, Cohen's d = .347) and greater increases in developmental assets (beta = 2.517, p < .001, Cohen's d = .231), with significantly stronger impacts for girls. CFS interventions meeting higher programing quality criteria were associated with greater impact on both PSWB and development assets (beta = 2.603 vs. beta = 1.793 and beta = 2.942 vs. beta = 2.337 for attenders at higher and lower-quality CFSs c.f. nonattenders, respectively). Amongst boys, benefits of program attendance were only indicated for those attending higher-quality CFS (beta = 2.084, p = .006 for PSWB). At follow-up, however, there were no discernable impacts of prior CFS attendance on any measures. Age and school attendance were the only characteristics that predicted an outcome - developmental assets - at follow-up. Attendance at CFSs - particularly involving higher-quality programming - supported children's well-being and development. However, sustained impact beyond active CFS programming was not demonstrated. Intervention goals and strategies in humanitarian contexts need to address the challenge of connecting children to other resources to facilitate developmental progress in conditions of protracted displacement."
427,A,"Internalising and externalising problems commonly co-occur in childhood. Yet, few developmental models describing the structure of child psychopathology appropriately account for this comorbidity. We evaluate a model of childhood psychopathology that separates the unique and shared contribution of individual psychological symptoms into specific internalising, externalising and general psychopathology factors and assess how these general and specific factors predict long-term outcomes concerning criminal behaviour, academic achievement and affective symptoms in three independent cohorts. Data were drawn from independent birth cohorts (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), N = 11,612; Generation R, N = 7,946; Maternal Adversity, Vulnerability and Neurodevelopment (MAVAN), N = 408). Child psychopathology was assessed between 4 and 8 years using a range of diagnostic and questionnaire-based measures, and multiple informants. First, structural equation models were used to assess the fit of hypothesised models of shared and unique components of psychopathology in all cohorts. Once the model was chosen, linear/logistic regressions were used to investigate whether these factors were associated with important outcomes such as criminal behaviour, academic achievement and well-being from late adolescence/early adulthood. The model that included specific factors for internalising/externalising and a general psychopathology factor capturing variance shared between symptoms regardless of their classification fits well for all of the cohorts. As hypothesised, general psychopathology factor scores were predictive of all outcomes of later functioning, while specific internalising factor scores predicted later internalising outcomes. Specific externalising factor scores, capturing variance not shared by any other psychological symptoms, were not predictive of later outcomes. Early symptoms of psychopathology carry information that is syndrome-specific as well as indicative of general vulnerability and the informant reporting on the child. The 'general psychopathology factor' might be more relevant for long-term outcomes than specific symptoms. These findings emphasise the importance of considering the co-occurrence of common internalising and externalising problems in childhood when considering long-term impact."
428,A,"Children with ADHD frequently engage in higher rates of externalizing behaviors in adulthood relative to children without. However, externalizing behaviors vary across development. Little is known about how this risk unfolds across development. Phenotypic and polygenic models of childhood ADHD were used to predict individual differences in adult externalizing trajectories. Supportive parenting, school connectedness, and peer closeness were then examined as causal mechanisms. Data were from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (N = 7,674). Externalizing behavior was measured using data from age 18 to 32 and modeled using latent class growth analysis. Child ADHD was measured using retrospective self-report (phenotypic model) and genome-wide polygenic risk scores (polygenic model). Multiple mediation models examined the direct and indirect effects of the phenotypic and polygenic models (separately) on externalizing trajectories through the effects of adolescent supportive parenting, school connectedness, and peer closeness. Phenotypic and polygenic models of ADHD were associated with being in the High Decreasing (3.2% of sample) and Moderate (16.1%) adult externalizing trajectories, but not the severe Low Increasing trajectory (2.6%), relative to the Normal trajectory (78.2%). Associations between both models of ADHD on the High Decreasing and Moderate trajectories were partially mediated through the effects of school connectedness, but not supportive parenting or peer closeness. Findings shed light on how childhood ADHD affects downstream psychosocial processes that then predict specific externalizing outcomes in adulthood. They also reinforce the importance of fostering a strong school environment for adolescents with (and without) ADHD, as this context plays a critical role in shaping the development of externalizing behaviors in adulthood."
429,A,"Diverse behaviour problems in childhood correlate phenotypically, suggesting a general dimension of psychopathology that has been called the p factor. The shared genetic architecture between childhood psychopathology traits also supports a genetic p. This study systematically investigates the manifestation of this common dimension across self-, parent- and teacher-rated measures in childhood and adolescence. The sample included 7,026 twin pairs from the Twins Early Development Study (TEDS). First, we employed multivariate twin models to estimate common genetic and environmental influences on p based on diverse measures of behaviour problems rated by children, parents and teachers at ages 7, 9, 12 and 16 (depressive traits, emotional problems, peer problems, autism traits, hyperactivity, antisocial behaviour, conduct problems and psychopathic tendencies). Second, to assess the stability of genetic and environmental influences on p across time, we conducted longitudinal twin modelling of the first phenotypic principal components of childhood psychopathological measures across each of the four ages. Third, we created a genetic p factor in 7,026 unrelated genotyped individuals based on eight polygenic scores for psychiatric disorders to estimate how a general polygenic predisposition to mostly adult psychiatric disorders relates to childhood p. Behaviour problems were consistently correlated phenotypically and genetically across ages and raters. The p factor is substantially heritable (50%-60%) and manifests consistently across diverse ages and raters. However, residual variation in the common factor models indicates unique contributions as well. Genetic correlations of p components across childhood and adolescence suggest stability over time (49%-78%). A polygenic general psychopathology factor derived from studies of psychiatric disorders consistently predicted a general phenotypic p factor across development (0.3%-0.9%). Diverse forms of psychopathology generally load on a common p factor, which is highly heritable. There are substantial genetic influences on the stability of p across childhood. Our analyses indicate genetic overlap between general risk for psychiatric disorders in adulthood and p in childhood, even as young as age 7. The p factor has far-reaching implications for genomic research and, eventually, for diagnosis and treatment of behaviour problems."
430,A,"Mental disorders, including Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), have a complex etiology, and identification of underlying genetic risk factors is challenging. This study used a multistep approach to identify and validate a novel risk gene for ADHD and psychiatric comorbidity. In a single family, severely affected by ADHD and cooccurring disorders, we applied single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-array analysis to detect copy-number variations (CNVs) linked to disease. Genes present in the identified CNV were subsequently tested for their association with ADHD in the largest data set currently available (n = 55,374); this gene-set and gene-based association analyses were based on common genetic variants. Significant findings were taken forward for functional validation using Drosophila melanogaster as biological model system, altering gene expression using the GAL4-UAS system and a pan-neuronal driver, and subsequently characterizing locomotor activity and sleep as functional readouts. We identified a copy number gain in 8p23.3, which segregated with psychiatric phenotypes in the family and was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. Common genetic variants in this locus were associated with ADHD, especially those in FBXO25 and TDRP. Overexpression of the FBXO25 orthologue in two Drosophila models consistently led to increased locomotor activity and reduced sleep compared with the genetic background control. We combine ADHD risk gene identification in an individual family with genetic association testing in a large case-control data set and functional validation in a model system, together providing an important illustration of an integrative approach suggesting that FBXO25 contributes to key features of ADHD and comorbid neuropsychiatric disorders."
431,A,"We examined whether childhood conduct problems predicted a wide range of adverse outcomes in emerging adulthood and whether the association with internalizing problems remained after adjusting for general comorbidity and externalizing problems. Participants were 18,649 twins from the Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden. At age 9/12, parents rated their children on eight conduct problems. Adverse outcomes were retrieved from national registers in emerging adulthood (median follow-up time = 9.2 years), including diagnoses of six psychiatric disorders, prescriptions of antidepressants, suicide attempts, criminality, high school ineligibility, and social welfare recipiency. We estimated risk for the separate outcomes and examined if conduct problems predicted an internalizing factor above and beyond a general comorbidity and an externalizing factor. We used twin analyses to estimate genetic and environmental contributions to these associations. On the average, each additional conduct symptom in childhood was associated with a 32% increased risk of the adverse outcomes in emerging adulthood (mean hazard ratio = 1.32; range = 1.16, 1.56). A latent childhood conduct problems factor predicted the internalizing factor in emerging adulthood (beta(boys) = .24, standard error, SE = 0.03; beta(girls) = .17, SE = 0.03), above and beyond its association with the externalizing (beta(boys) = 0.21, SE = 0.04; beta(girls) = 0.17, SE = 0.05) and general factors (beta(boys) = 0.45, SE = 0.03; beta(girls) = 0.34, SE = 0.04). These associations were differentially influenced by genetic and environmental factors. It is important to monitor boys and girls with conduct problems not only for future externalizing problems, but also for future internalizing problems. Prevention of specific outcomes, however, might require interventions at different levels."
432,A,"Social anxiety disorder (SAD) aggregates in families. To elucidate intergenerational transmission of risk, we examined whether childhood SAD and symptoms of anxiety were prospectively predicted by stable infant temperamental inhibition, maternal SAD, maternal generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and maternal parenting behaviours. We conducted a longitudinal study beginning prenatally with follow-up at 4, 10, 14 and 58 months postnatally. Mothers were assessed for anxiety disorders prenatally and assigned to one of three groups: SAD (n = 67), GAD (n = 56) and nonanxious controls (n = 94). We assessed infant temperamental inhibition at 4 and 14 months, maternal parenting behaviours at 10 and 58 months, and child anxiety disorders and symptoms at 58 months. Child SAD at 58 months was predicted by prenatal maternal SAD (OR = 23.76, 95% CI = 1.15-60.37), but not by prenatal maternal GAD (OR = 7.44, 95% CI = 0.32-124.49), stable temperamental inhibition or maternal behaviours. Child anxiety symptoms at 58 months were predicted specifically by maternal SAD (but not GAD), and also by concurrent maternal intrusiveness. Stable temperamental inhibition moderated the association between 10-month maternal encouragement and 58-month child anxiety symptoms. We found evidence for specificity of risk for child SAD and anxiety symptoms from maternal SAD compared to maternal GAD. Childhood anxiety symptoms were also predicted by an interaction between a lack of maternal encouragement in infancy and stable temperamental inhibition, as well as concurrent maternal intrusiveness. The findings have clinical implications for targeted prevention of child anxiety."
433,A,"The longitudinal course of multiple symptom domains in adolescents treated for major depression is not known. Revealing the temporal course of general and specific psychopathology factors, including potential differences between psychotherapies, may aid therapeutic decision-making. Participants were adolescents with major depressive disorder (aged 11-17; 75% female; N = 465) who were part of the IMPACT trial, a randomized controlled trial comparing cognitive behavioral therapy, short-term psychoanalytic psychotherapy, and brief psychosocial intervention. Self-reported symptoms at baseline and 6, 12, 36, 52, and 86 weeks postrandomization were analyzed with bifactor modeling. General psychopathology factor scores decreased across treatment and one-year follow-up. Specific melancholic features and depressive cognitions factors decreased from baseline to 6 weeks. Conduct problems decreased across treatment and follow-up. Anxiety increased by 6 weeks and then reverted to baseline levels. Obsessions-compulsions did not change. Changes in general and specific factors were not significantly different between the three psychotherapies during treatment. During follow-up, however, conduct problems decreased more in brief psychosocial intervention versus cognitive behavioral therapy (1.02, 95% Bayes credible interval 0.25, 1.96), but not versus short-term psychoanalytic psychotherapy. The clinical response signature in this trial is best revealed by rapid reductions in depression symptoms and general psychopathology. Protracted improvements in general psychopathology and conduct problems subsequently occur. Psychosocial treatments for adolescent depression have comparable effects on general and specific psychopathology, although a psychoeducational, goal-focused approach may be indicated for youth with comorbid conduct problems."
434,A,"In England, all state-funded schools are inspected by an independent government agency, the Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills (Ofsted). Inspections aim to hold schools accountable and to promote the improvement of education, with the results made available to the public. Ofsted reports intend to index school quality, but their influence on students' individual outcomes has not been previously studied. The aim of the current study was to explore the extent to which school quality, as indexed by Ofsted ratings, is associated with students' educational achievement, well-being and school engagement. We use an England population-based sample of 4,391 individuals, for whom school performance at age 11 and GCSE grades at age 16 were accessed from the National Pupil Database, and who completed measures of well-being and school engagement at age 16. We found that Ofsted ratings of secondary school quality accounted for 4% of the variance in students' educational achievement at age 16, which was further reduced to 1% of the variance after we accounted for prior school performance at age 11 and family socioeconomic status. Furthermore, Ofsted ratings were weak predictors of school engagement and student well-being, with an average correlation of .03. Conclusion Our findings suggest that differences in school quality, as indexed by Ofsted ratings, have little relation to students' individual outcomes. Accordingly, our results challenge the usefulness of Ofsted ratings as guides for parents and students when choosing secondary schools."
435,A,"Severe health anxiety (HA) is characterized by excessive and impairing worry and preoccupation with health issues and can cause increased and unnecessary medical examinations. HA in childhood and adolescence is scarcely explored, hindering the potential for prevention and early intervention. HA was assessed in 1,278 children/youths at two time points at ages 11 and 16 years in a general population-based birth cohort. Register-based data on costs related to nonhospital-based primary and secondary somatic health services were obtained over the follow-up period. The presence of functional somatic symptoms, emotional disorders and chronic somatic illness at baseline were included as covariates. High HA (top 10% score) at age 11 predicted high HA at age 16 (relative risk [RR] 2.03, 95% CI: 1.26-3.31). The group with persistent HA was small (n = 17, 1.3%), resulting in broad confidence intervals. The statistical effect of HA at age 11 on HA at age 16 was heavily reduced after adjustment for sex and all covariates (RR: 1.49, 95% CI: 0.85-2.60). In the adjusted model, somatic illness at age 11 (RR: 1.91, 95% CI: 1.22-2.98) and female sex (RR: 3.33, 95% CI: 2.01-5.50) were independently associated with HA at age 16. Persistent HA was associated with approximately doubled healthcare costs compared to the group with consistently low HA. Incident HA at age 16 was associated with increased costs over follow-up. The increased costs were not explained by chronic somatic illness. A small subgroup of children had persistent high levels of HA from late childhood to adolescence and displayed increased healthcare costs. Female sex and chronic somatic disorders at age 11 were independent risk factors of HA at age 16. These findings provide potential means of early identification and of therapeutic levers. Further intervention development and evaluation are needed."
436,C,"The evolution of cosmic structures, the formation and growth of the first black holes and the connection to their baryonic environment are key unsolved problems in astrophysics. The X-ray Athena mission and the gravitational-wave Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) offer independent and complementary angles on these problems. We show that up to about 10 black hole binaries in the mass range of approximately 10(5) to 10(8) solar masses discovered by LISA at redshift below about 3.5 could be detected by Athena in an exposure time up to 100 ks, if prompt X-ray emission of 1-10% of the Eddington luminosity is present. Likewise, if any LISA-detected extreme-mass-ratio inspirals occur in accretion disks, Athena can detect associated electromagnetic emission out to a redshift of about 1. Finally, warned by LISA, Athena can point in advance and stare at stellar-mass binary black hole mergers at redshift less than about 0.1. These science opportunities emphasize the vast discovery space of simultaneous observations from the two observatories, which would be missed if they were operated in different epochs. This Perspective highlights the science opportunities and the vast discovery space of simultaneous observations from the LISA and Athena observatories, which would be missed if they were operated in different epochs ."
437,C,"Over the course of its history, the Milky Way has ingested multiple smaller satellite galaxies1. Although these accreted stellar populations can be forensically identified as kinematically distinct structures within the Galaxy, it is difficult in general to date precisely the age at which any one merger occurred. Recent results have revealed a population of stars that were accreted via the collision of a dwarf galaxy, called Gaia-Enceladus1, leading to substantial pollution of the chemical and dynamical properties of the Milky Way. Here we identify the very bright, naked-eye star. Indi as an indicator of the age of the early in situ population of the Galaxy. We combine asteroseismic, spectroscopic, astrometric and kinematic observations to show that this metal-poor, alpha-element-rich star was an indigenous member of the halo, and we measure its age to be 11.0 +/- 0.7 (stat) +/- 0.8 (sys) billion years. The star bears hallmarks consistent with having been kinematically heated by the Gaia-Enceladus collision. Its age implies that the earliest the merger could have begun was 11.6 and 13.2 billion years ago, at 68% and 95% confidence, respectively. Computations based on hierarchical cosmological models slightly reduce the above limits."
438,C,"The European Space Agency's Rosetta mission(1) has acquired unprecedented measurements of the surface of the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (hereafter, 67P), the composition of which, as determined by in situ and remote-sensing instruments, including the VIRTIS instrument(2), seems to be an assemblage of ices, minerals and organic material(3). We performed a refined analysis of infrared observations of the nucleus of 67P carried out by the VIRTIS-M hyperspectral imager. We find that the overall shape of the infrared spectrum of 67P is similar to that of other carbon-rich outer Solar System objects, suggesting a possible genetic link with them. More importantly, we also confirm the complex spectral structure of the wide 2.8-3.6 mu m absorption feature populated by fainter bands. Among these, we unambiguously identify the presence of aliphatic organics by their ubiquitous 3.38 mu m, 3.42 mu m and 3.47 mu m bands. This infrared detection of aliphatic species on a cometary surface has strong implications for the evolutionary history of the primordial Solar System and is evidence that comets provide an evolutionary link between interstellar material and Solar System bodies(4). A refined analysis of infrared observations of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko from the VIRTIS instrument on board the Rosetta spacecraft has revealed the presence of aliphatic organic molecules on the comet nucleus."
439,C,"Pockets of iron-rich melt within asteroids get progressively enriched in sulfur while the asteroid is cooling, generating excess pressure that can push the melt up to the surface. This 'ferrovolcanism' can be the origin of the stony-iron pallasite meteorites and can explain the contradicting results from asteroid 16 Psyche. As differentiated planetesimals cool, their cores can solidify from the outside in(1), as evidenced by palaeomagnetic measurements and cooling-rate estimates of iron meteorites(2,3). The details of outside-in solidification and fate of residual core melt are poorly understood. For a core primarily composed of iron and nickel alloyed with lighter constituent elements such as sulfur, this inward core growth would probably be achieved by growth of solid iron-nickel dendrites(4). Growth of iron-nickel dendrites results in interconnected pockets of residual melt that become progressively enriched in sulfur up to a eutectic composition of 31 wt% sulfur as iron-nickel continues to solidify(4). Here, we show that regions of residual sulfur-enriched iron-nickel melt in the core attain sufficient excess pressures to propagate via dykes into the mantle. Thus, core material will intrude into the overlying rocky mantle or possibly even erupt onto the planetesimal's surface. We refer to these processes collectively as ferrovolcanism. Our calculations show that ferrovolcanic surface eruptions are more likely on bodies with mantles less than 50 km thick. We show that intrusive ferromagmatism can produce pallasites, an enigmatic class of meteorites composed of olivine crystals entrained in a matrix of iron-nickel metal(4). Ferrovolcanic eruptions may explain the observations that asteroid 16 Psyche has a bulk density inconsistent with iron meteorites(5) yet shows evidence of a metallic surface composition(6)."
440,C,"Interstellar comets penetrating through the Solar System had been anticipated for decades(1,2). The discovery of asteroidal-looking 'Oumuamua(3,4) was thus a huge surprise and a puzzle. Furthermore, the physical properties of the 'first scout' turned out to be impossible to reconcile with Solar System objects(4-6), challenging our view of interstellar minor bodies(7,8). Here, we report the identification and early characterization of a new interstellar object, which has an evidently cometary appearance. The body was discovered by Gennady Borisov on 30 August 2019 ut and subsequently identified as hyperbolic by our data mining code in publicly available astrometric data. The initial orbital solution implies a very high hyperbolic excess speed of ~32 km s(-1), consistent with 'Oumuamua(9) and theoretical predictions(2,7). Images taken on 10 and 13 September 2019 ut with the William Herschel Telescope and Gemini North Telescope show an extended coma and a faint, broad tail. We measure a slightly reddish colour with a g '-r ' colour index of 0.66 +/- 0.01 mag, compatible with Solar System comets. The observed morphology is also unremarkable and best explained by dust with a power-law size-distribution index of -3.7 +/- 1.8 and a low ejection speed (44 +/- 14 m s(-1) for beta = 1 particles, where beta is the ratio of the solar gravitational attraction to the solar radiation pressure). The nucleus is probably ~1 km in radius, again a common value among Solar System comets, and has a negligible chance of experiencing rotational disruption. Based on these early characteristics, and putting its hyperbolic orbit aside, 2I/Borisov appears indistinguishable from the native Solar System comets. 2I/Borisov is the first interstellar comet we know to have visited the Solar System, and the second interstellar visitor after 'Oumuamua. Initial observations with the William Herschel Telescope and Gemini North Telescope reveal cometary features indistinguishable from Solar System comets, apart from its hyperbolic orbit."
441,C,"Tidally locked exoplanets with oceans are supposed to be globally frozen except around the substellar point, where the water stays liquid-known as the eyeball state. However, if sea-ice drift is included in climate models, the open water region shrinks and can even disappear, resulting in a snowball state. Tidally locked terrestrial planets around low-mass stars are the prime targets for future atmospheric characterizations of potentially habitable systems(1), especially the three nearby ones-Proxima b (ref. (2)), TRAPPIST-1e (ref. (3)) and LHS 1140b (ref. (4)). Previous studies suggest that if these planets had surface oceans they would be in an eyeball-like climate state(5-10): ice free in the vicinity of the substellar point and ice covered in the remaining regions. However, an important component of the climate system-sea-ice dynamics-has not been fully considered in previous studies. A fundamental question is whether an open ocean is stable against a globally ice-covered snowball state. Here we show that sea-ice drift cools the ocean's surface when the ice flows towards the warmer substellar region and melts through absorbing heat from the ocean and the overlying air. As a result, the open ocean shrinks and can even disappear when atmospheric greenhouse gases are not much more abundant than on Earth, turning the planet into a snowball state. This occurs for both synchronous rotation and spin-orbit resonances (such as 3:2). These results suggest that sea-ice drift strongly reduces the open-ocean area and can significantly impact the habitability of tidally locked planets."
442,C,"All evolved stars of up to 2 solar masses undergo a helium core flash at the end of their first stage as a giant star. Although theoretically predicted more than 50 years ago(1,2), this core flash phase has yet to be observationally probed. We show here that gravity modes stochastically excited by helium-flash-driven convection are able to reach the stellar surface and induce periodic photometric variabilities in hot subdwarf stars with amplitudes of the order of a few thousandths of a magnitude. As such, they can now be detected by space-based photometry with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite in relatively bright stars (for example, Johnson-Cousins magnitudes of I-C less than or similar to 13 mag)(3). The range of predicted periods spans from a few thousand seconds to tens of thousands of seconds, depending on the details of the excitation region. In addition, we find that stochastically excited pulsations reproduce the pulsations observed in a few helium-rich hot subdwarf stars. These stars, particularly the future Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite target Feige 46, are the most promising candidates to probe the helium core flash for the first time. A theoretical thermonuclear runaway that converts helium to carbon in the interior of an evolved star-the helium core flash-has not yet been confirmed observationally. Asteroseismic models of hot subdwarf stars show that the helium core flash should be detectable with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite."
443,C,"Despite its importance to our understanding of physics at supranuclear densities, the equation of state (EoS) of matter deep within neutron stars remains poorly understood. Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are among the most useful astrophysical objects in the Universe for testing fundamental physics, and place some of the most stringent constraints on this high-density EoS. Pulsar timing-the process of accounting for every rotation of a pulsar over long time periods-can precisely measure a wide variety of physical phenomena, including those that allow the measurement of the masses of the components of a pulsar binary system1. One of these, called relativistic Shapiro delay2, can yield precise masses for both an MSP and its companion; however, it is only easily observed in a small subset of high-precision, highly inclined (nearly edge-on) binary pulsar systems. By combining data from the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) 12.5-yr data set with recent orbitalphase-specific observations using the Green Bank Telescope, we have measured the mass of the MSP J0740+6620 to be 2:14thorn0:10 similar to 0:09 I M. (68.3% credibility interval; the 95.4% credibility interval is 2:14thorn0:20 similar to 0:18 I M.). It is highly likely to be the most massive neutron star yet observed, and serves as a strong constraint on the neutron star interior EoS."
444,C,"An extensive survey to search for members of the only known Kuiper belt family, named after the parent body Haumea, found no family members fainter than absolute magnitude H-r = 7.9, significantly brighter than the detection limit (H-r = 9.5). This lack of small members is inconsistent with a catastrophic disruption as the origin of the Haumea family. While collisional families are common in the asteroid belt, only one is known in the Kuiper belt, linked to the dwarf planet Haumea. The characterization of Haumea's family helps to constrain its origin and, more generally, the collisional history of the Kuiper belt. However, the size distribution of the Haumea family is difficult to constrain from the known sample, which is affected by discovery biases. Here, we use the Outer Solar System Origins Survey (OSSOS) Ensemble to look for Haumea family members. In this OSSOS XVI study we report the detection of three candidates with small ejection velocities relative to the family formation centre. The largest discovery, 2013 UQ(15), is conclusively a Haumea family member, with a low ejection velocity and neutral surface colours. Although the OSSOS Ensemble is sensitive to Haumea family members to a limiting absolute magnitude (H-r) of 9.5 (inferred diameter of ~90 km), the smallest candidate is significantly larger, H-r = 7.9. The Haumea family members larger than similar or equal to 20 km in diameter must be characterized by a shallow H-distribution slope in order to produce only these three large detections. This shallow size distribution suggests that the family formed in a graze-and-merge scenario, not a catastrophic collision."
445,C,"Distance measurements for extragalactic objects are a fundamental problem in astronomy1,2 and cosmology3,4. In the era of precision cosmology, we urgently need better measurements of cosmological distances to observationally test the increasing H0 tension of the Hubble constant measured from different tools5-7. Using spectroastrometry8, GRAVITY at The Very Large Telescope Interferometer successfully revealed the structure, kinematics and angular sizes of the broad-line region (BLR) of 3C 273 with an unprecedentedly high spatial resolution9. Fortunately, reverberation mapping (RM)10 of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) reliably provides linear sizes of their BLRs11. Here, we report a joint analysis of spectroastrometry and RM observations to measure AGN distances. We apply this analysis to 3C 273 observed by both GRAVITY9 and an RM campaign12, and find an angular distance of 551:5thorn97:3 78:7 I Mpc and H0 1/4 71:5thorn11:9 10:6 km s1 Mpc1 I. The advantages of the analysis are its pure geometrical measurements and that it simultaneously yields the mass of the central black hole. Moreover, we can conveniently repeat measurements of selected AGNs to efficiently reduce the statistical and systematic errors. Future observations of a reasonably sized sample (30 AGNs) will provide the distances of the AGNs and hence a new way of measuring H0 with a high precision (.3%) to test the H-0 tension."
446,C,"A highly magnified, strongly lensed star-forming galaxy is detected in X-rays. It is a low-mass, low-metallicity starburst that is a likely analogue to the first generation of galaxies, which may have played a role in reionizing the Universe. In the past decade, our understanding of how stars and galaxies formed during the first 5 billion years after the Big Bang has been revolutionized by observations that leverage gravitational lensing by intervening masses, which act as natural cosmic telescopes to magnify background sources. Previous studies have harnessed this effect to probe the distant Universe at ultraviolet, optical, infrared and millimetre wavelengths(1-6). However, strong-lensing studies of young, star-forming galaxies have never extended into X-ray wavelengths, which uniquely trace high-energy phenomena. Here, we report an X-ray detection of star formation in a highly magnified, strongly lensed galaxy. This lensed galaxy, seen during the first third of the history of the Universe, is a low-mass, low-metallicity starburst with elevated X-ray emission, and is a likely analogue to the first generation of galaxies. Our measurements yield insight into the role that X-ray emission from stellar populations in the first generation of galaxies may play in reionizing the Universe. This observation paves the way for future strong-lensing-assisted X-ray studies of distant galaxies reaching orders of magnitude below the detection limits of current deep fields, and previews the depths that will be attainable with future X-ray observatories."
447,C,"The oxygen emission at 557.7 nm is a ubiquitous component of the spectrum of the terrestrial polar aurora and the reason for its usual green colour(1). It is also observed as a thin layer of glow surrounding the Earth near 90 km altitude in the dayside atmosphere(2,3)but it has so far eluded detection in other planets. Here we report dayglow observations of the green line outside the Earth. They have been performed with the Nadir and Occultation for Mars Discovery ultraviolet and visible spectrometer instrument on board the European Space Agency's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter. Using a special observation mode, scans of the dayside limb provide the altitude distribution of the intensity of the 557.7 nm line and its variability. Two intensity peaks are observed near 80 and 120 km altitude, corresponding to photodissociation of CO(2)by solar Lyman alpha and extreme ultraviolet radiation, respectively. A weaker emission, originating from the same upper level of the oxygen atom, is observed in the near ultraviolet at 297.2 nm. These simultaneous measurements of both oxygen lines make it possible to directly derive a ratio of 16.5 between the visible and ultraviolet emissions, and thereby clarify a controversy between discordant ab initio calculations and atmospheric measurements that has persisted despite multiple efforts. This ratio is considered a standard for measurements connecting the ultraviolet and visible spectral regions. This result has consequences for the study of auroral and airglow processes and for spectral calibration. The oxygen emission at 557.7 nm, responsible for the green colour of auroras on Earth, is present in two layers at 80 and 120 km altitude on the dayside atmosphere of Mars. Simultaneous observations of the oxygen both in this visible line and in the ultraviolet could also constrain the elusive visible/ultraviolet intensity ratio of the auroral emission to a value of 16.5."
448,C,"The identification of the main contributors to the locally observed fluxes of cosmic rays is a prime objective in the resolution of the long-standing enigma of the source of cosmic rays. We report on a compelling similarity of the energy and radial distributions of multi-TeV cosmic rays extracted from observations of very-high-energy gamma-rays towards the Galactic Centre and two prominent clusters of young massive stars, Cygnus OB2 and Westerlund 1. We interpret this resemblance as evidence that cosmic rays responsible for the diffuse very-high-energy gamma-ray emission from the Galactic Centre are accelerated by the ultracompact stellar clusters located in the heart of the Galactic Centre. The derived 1/r decrement of the cosmic ray density with the distance from a star cluster is a distinct signature of continuous cosmic ray injection into the interstellar medium over a few million years. The lack of brightening of the gamma-ray images towards the stellar clusters excludes the leptonic origin of gamma-ray radiation. The hard, proportional to E-2.3-type, power-law energy spectra of parent protons continues up to similar to 1 PeV. The efficiency of conversion of the kinetic energy of stellar winds to cosmic rays can be as high as 10%, implying that young massive stars may operate as proton PeVatrons with a dominant contribution to the flux of the highest-energy Galactic cosmic rays."
449,C,"Escherichia coli bacteria and yeast cultures (representative prokaryotes and eukaryotes) have been tested under laboratory conditions in a 100% H-2 atmosphere. They can reproduce normally, with lower growth rates, producing a range of biosignature gases. Exoplanets with a H-2-dominated atmosphere might thus not be totally hostile to some forms of life. Theory and observation for the search for life on exoplanets via atmospheric 'biosignature gases' is accelerating, motivated by the capabilities of the next generation of space- and ground-based telescopes. The most observationally accessible rocky planet atmospheres are those dominated by molecular hydrogen gas, because the low density of H-2 gas leads to an expansive atmosphere. The capability of life to withstand such exotic environments, however, has not been tested in this context. We demonstrate that single-celled microorganisms (Escherichia coli and yeast) that normally do not inhabit H-2-dominated environments can survive and grow in a 100% H-2 atmosphere. We also describe the astonishing diversity of dozens of different gases produced by E. coli, including many already proposed as potential biosignature gases (for example, nitrous oxide, ammonia, methanethiol, dimethylsulfide, carbonyl sulfide and isoprene). This work demonstrates the utility of laboratory experiments to better identify which kinds of alien environments can host some form of possibly detectable life."
450,C,"The Galactic magnetic field plays an important role in the evolution of the Galaxy, but its small-scale behaviour is still poorly known. It is not known whether the Galactic field permeates the halo of the Galaxy. By observing pulsars in the halo globular cluster 47 Tucanae, we have probed the Galactic magnetic field at arcsecond scales, discovering an unexpected large gradient in the component of the magnetic field parallel to the line of sight. This gradient is aligned with a direction perpendicular to the Galactic disk and could be explained by magnetic fields amplified to some 60 mu G within the globular cluster. Such a scenario supports the existence of a magnetized outflow that extends from the Galactic disk to the halo and interacts with 47 Tucanae. Observations of the Faraday rotation towards pulsars in the halo globular cluster 47 Tucanae have been used to constrain the magnetic field strength in the Galactic halo, finding that it is unexpectedly strong."
451,C,"2M1510 is an approximately 45-million-year-old triple system of brown dwarfs, two of which form a close binary in a 20-day orbit and have almost the same mass (3.82% and 3.75% of the mass of the Sun, respectively). Their physical parameters are in good agreement with evolutionary models except for luminosity, suggesting that we might be underestimating the masses of brown dwarfs and massive exoplanets by about 30%. Mass, radius and age are three of the most fundamental parameters for celestial objects, enabling insight into the evolution and internal physics of stars, brown dwarfs and planets. Brown dwarfs are hydrogen-rich objects that are unable to sustain core fusion reactions but are supported against collapse by electron degeneracy pressure(1). As they age, brown dwarfs cool, reducing their radius and luminosity. Young exoplanets follow a similar behaviour. Brown dwarf evolutionary models are relied upon to infer the masses, radii and ages of young brown dwarfs(2,3). Similar models are also used to infer the mass and radius of directly imaged exoplanets(4). Unfortunately, only sparse empirical mass, radius and age measurements are currently available, and so the models remain mostly unvalidated. Double-line eclipsing binaries provide the most direct route towards the absolute determination of the masses and radii of stars(5-7). Here we report the discovery by SPECULOOS (Search for habitable Planets EClipsing ULtra-cOOl Stars) of the 2M1510A triple system, consisting of a nearby, eclipsing, double-line brown dwarf binary and a widely separated tertiary brown dwarf companion. We find that the system is a member of Argus, a 45 +/- 5 million-year-old moving group(8,9). The system's age matches those of currently known directly imaged exoplanets so 2M1510A provides an opportunity to benchmark evolutionary models of brown dwarfs and young planets. We find that widely used evolutionary models(3) do reproduce the mass, radius and age of the binary components remarkably well, but overestimate their luminosity by up to 0.65 magnitudes, which could result in underestimations of 20% to 35% of photometric masses for directly imaged exoplanets and young-field brown dwarfs."
452,E,"Our purpose is to adapt a statistical method for the analysis of discrete numerical series to the keywords appearing in scientific articles of a given area. As an example, we apply our methodological approach to the study of the keywords in the Library and Information Sciences (LIS) area. Our objective is to detect the new author keywords that appear in a fixed knowledge area in the period of 1 year in order to quantify the probabilities of survival for 10 years as a function of the impact of the journals where they appeared. Many of the new keywords appearing in the LIS field are ephemeral. Actually, more than half are never used again. In general, the terms most commonly used in the LIS area come from other areas. The average survival time of these keywords is approximately 3 years, being slightly higher in the case of words that were published in journals classified in the second quartile of the area. We believe that measuring the appearance and disappearance of terms will allow understanding some relevant aspects of the evolution of a discipline, providing in this way a new bibliometric approach."
453,E,"Digital information is fragile, yet access to digital information over time is a critical underpinning of core values and functions in our society, from open government to research and scholarship. Digital preservation research has focused on identifying technical, economic, and organizational sources of risk and has relied on an assumption that individuals will behave in rational and predictable ways in response to the same information. This article asserts that viewing digital preservation as a process that takes place in complex social contexts is just as important as thinking about digital preservation in terms of technological or economic issues. This is particularly important for understanding how individuals involved in digital preservation construct their understanding of risk because social factors influence how people construct their understanding of, and behave in response to, risk information. The author proposes an eight-factor model for the social construction of risk, which includes: communication, complexity, expertise, organizations, political culture, trust, uncertainty, and vulnerability. The article demonstrates how these factors influence individuals as they construct their understanding of risk in the context of digital preservation and how this in turn affects digital preservation decisions."
454,E,"Smart electric meters collect data on electricity use to potentially improve efficiency for utilities, shape power consumption, and ultimately reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Consumer groups and experts have raised concerns about privacy, as smart meters can provide detailed information about activity within the home. This study examines privacy beliefs of U.S. consumers using qualitative data from focus groups together with experimental data from a national online survey of utility customers. Exploratory analysis of focus group findings suggested that consumers who felt in control of their data perceived fewer risks and more benefits from having access to the data. Participants in the online experiment saw greater risk and less benefit when advised that smart meters could be used to raise prices under time-of-use pricing. Participants also saw greater risk when the utility shared customer data with a third party. Risks and benefits influenced perceptions of control. These findings accord with several information privacy frameworks adding new insights about consumers' perceived control over their energy data. The findings can inform utility companies and policymakers with respect to giving consumers more control over their data, reducing consumers' privacy concerns, communicating benefits of smart meter data, and providing accurate information about the risks."
455,E,"The aim of the study was to develop an empirical measure for everyday information mastering (EIM). EIM describes the ways that individuals, based on their beliefs, attitudes, and expectations, orient themselves to information as a resource of everyday action. The key features of EIM were identified by conceptual analysis focusing on three EIM frameworks. Four modes of EIM-Proactive, Social, Reactive, and Passive-and their 12 constituents were identified. A survey of 39 items was developed in two pilot studies to operationalize the identified modes as measurable EIM constituents. The respondents in the main study were upper secondary school students (n =412). Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was applied to validate subscales for each EIM constituent. Seven subscales emerged: Inquiring and Scanning in the Proactive mode, Social media-centered, and Experiential in the Social mode, and Information poor, Overwhelmed, and Blunting in the Passive mode. Two constituents, Serendipitous and Intuitive, were not supported in the EFA. The findings highlight that the core constituents of an individual's everyday information mastering can be operationalized as psychometric scales. The instrument contributes to the systematic empirical study of EIM constituents and their relationships. The study further sheds light on key modes of EIM."
456,E,"The outcome of exploratory information retrieval is not only dependent on the effectiveness of individual responses to a set of queries, but also on relevant information retrieved during the entire exploratory search session. We study the effect of search assistance, operationalized as an interactive faceted query suggestion, for both whole-session effectiveness and engagement through interactive faceted query suggestion. A user experiment is reported, where users performed exploratory search tasks, comparing interactive faceted query suggestion and a control condition with only conventional typed-query interaction. Data comprised of interaction and search logs show that the availability of interactive faceted query suggestion substantially improves whole-session effectiveness by increasing recall without sacrificing precision. The increased engagement with interactive faceted query suggestion is targeted to direct situated navigation around the initial query scope, but is not found to improve individual queries on average. The results imply that research in exploratory search should focus on measuring and designing tools that engage users with directed situated navigation support for improving whole-session performance."
457,E,"Although collective trolling is an integral part of online communities, it has received little scholarly attention. Research on collective trolling, which involves an organized group trolling effort, is in its infancy perhaps because early works on online trolling depicted it as the deviant behavior of individuals who acted in isolation and under hidden identity. Thus, it is still unclear what collective trolling is and how it evolves. To address this gap, we collected 12,840 posts and comments pertinent to a brief, controversial, and very visible collective trolling event. The event, which surrounded Chinese rapper PG One on the Chinese microblogging platformSina Weibo, received 40 million reads in 1 day and a lot of media attention. Based on a thematic content analysis of 480 posts, we describe the collective trolling lifecycle through five distinct stages defined by posting frequency and content of posts. We also explain the transformation of participants' roles, tactics, motives, behavioral tone, and the variations in their thematic content, stakeholder group affiliation, and roles over time. The major contributions of the study are the characterization of collective trolling, and the addition of a lifecycle model to the understanding of trolling as sociotechnical, context-dependent, and multidimensional phenomenon."
458,E,"Over the past decade, megajournals have expanded in popularity and established a legitimate niche in academic publishing. Leveraging advantages of digital publishing, megajournals are characterized by large publication volume, broad interdisciplinary scope, and peer-review filters that select primarily for scientific soundness as opposed to novelty or originality. These publishing innovations are complementary and competitive vis-a-vis traditional journals. We analyze how megajournals (PLOS One,Scientific Reports) are represented in different fields relative to prominent generalist journals (Nature,PNAS,Science) and """"quasi-megajournals"""" (Nature Communications,PeerJ). Our results show that both megajournals and prominent traditional journals have distinctive niches, despite the similar interdisciplinary scopes of such journals. These niches-defined by publishing volume and disciplinary diversity-are dynamic and varied over the relatively brief histories of the analyzed megajournals. Although the life sciences are the predominant contributor to megajournals, there is variation in the disciplinary composition of different megajournals. The growth trajectories and disciplinary composition of generalist journals-including megajournals-reflect changing knowledge dissemination and reward structures in science."
459,E,"In author name disambiguation, author forenames are used to decide which name instances are disambiguated together and how much they are likely to refer to the same author. Despite such a crucial role of forenames, their effect on the performance of heuristic (string matching) and algorithmic disambiguation is not well understood. This study assesses the contributions of forenames in author name disambiguation using multiple labeled data sets under varying ratios and lengths of full forenames, reflecting real-world scenarios in which an author is represented by forename variants (synonym) and some authors share the same forenames (homonym). The results show that increasing the ratios of full forenames substantially improves both heuristic and machine-learning-based disambiguation. Performance gains by algorithmic disambiguation are pronounced when many forenames are initialized or homonyms are prevalent. As the ratios of full forenames increase, however, they become marginal compared to those by string matching. Using a small portion of forename strings does not reduce much the performances of both heuristic and algorithmic disambiguation methods compared to using full-length strings. These findings provide practical suggestions, such as restoring initialized forenames into a full-string format via record linkage for improved disambiguation performances."
460,E,"In this position article, we synthesize various knowledge gaps in information privacy scholarship and propose a research agenda that promotes greater cross-disciplinary collaboration within the iSchool community and beyond. We start by critically examining Westin's conceptualization of information privacy and argue for a contextual approach that holds promise for overcoming some of Westin's weaknesses. We then highlight three contextual considerations for studying privacy-digital networks, marginalized populations, and the global context-and close by discussing how these considerations advance privacy theorization and technology design."
461,E,"Higher education institutions are continuing to develop their capacity for learning analytics (LA), which is a sociotechnical data-mining and analytic practice. Institutions rarely inform their students about LA practices, and there exist significant privacy concerns. Without a clear student voice in the design of LA, institutions put themselves in an ethical gray area. To help fill this gap in practice and add to the growing literature on students' privacy perspectives, this study reports findings from over 100 interviews with undergraduate students at eight U.S. higher education institutions. Findings demonstrate that students lacked awareness of educational data-mining and analytic practices, as well as the data on which they rely. Students see potential in LA, but they presented nuanced arguments about when and with whom data should be shared; they also expressed why informed consent was valuable and necessary. The study uncovered perspectives on institutional trust that were heretofore unknown, as well as what actions might violate that trust. Institutions must balance their desire to implement LA with their obligation to educate students about their analytic practices and treat them as partners in the design of analytic strategies reliant on student data in order to protect their intellectual privacy."
462,E,"To support historians in their work, we need to understand their work-related needs and propose what is required to support those needs. Although the quantity of digitized historical documents available is increasing, historians' ways of working with the digital documents have not been widely studied, particularly in authentic work settings. To better support the historians' reasoning processes, we investigate history researchers' work tasks as the context of information interaction and examine their cognitive access points into information. The analysis is based on a longitudinal observational research and interviews in a task-based research setting. Based on these findings in the historians' cognitive space, we build bridges into the document space. By studying the information interactions in real task contexts, we facilitate the provision of task-specific handles into documents that can be used in designing digital research tools for historians."
463,E,"Data protection laws, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, regulate aspects of online personalization. However, the data protection lens is too narrow to analyze personalization. To define conditions for personalization, we should understand data protection in its larger fundamental rights context, starting with the closely connected right to privacy. If the right to privacy is considered along with other European fundamental rights that protect information and communication flows, namely, communications confidentiality; the right to receive information; and freedom of expression, opinion, and thought, these rights are observed to enable what I call a """"personal information sphere"""" for each person. This notion highlights how privacy interferences affect other fundamental rights. The personal information sphere is grounded in European case law and is thus not just an academic affair. The essence of the personal information sphere is control, yet with a different meaning than mere control as guaranteed by data protection law. The personal information sphere is about people controlling how they situate themselves in information and communication networks. It follows that, to respect privacy and related rights, online personalization providers should actively involve users in the personalization process and enable them to use personalization for personal goals."
464,E,"Though there is a tension between citizens' privacy concerns and their acceptance of government surveillance, there is little systematic research in this space and less still in a cross-cultural context. We address the research gap by modeling the factors that drive public acceptance of government surveillance, and by exploring the influence of national culture. The research involved an online survey of 242 Australian and Sri Lankan residents. Data were analyzed using partial least squares, revealing that privacy concerns around initial collection of citizens' data influenced levels of acceptance of surveillance in Australia but not Sri Lanka, whereas concerns about secondary use of data did not influence levels of acceptance in either country. These findings suggest that respondents conflate surveillance with the collection of data and may not consider subsequent secondary use. We also investigate cultural differences, finding that societal collectivism and power distance significantly affect the strength of the relationships between privacy concerns and acceptance of surveillance, on the one hand, and adoption of privacy protections, on the other. Our research also considers the role of trust in government, and perceived need for surveillance. Findings are discussed with their implications for theory and practice."
465,E,"In this article, I propose the concept of resonance as a useful one for describing what it means to experience relevance. Based on an extensive interdisciplinary review, I provide a novel framework that presents resonance as a spectrum of experience with a multitude of outcomes ranging from a sense of harmony and coherence to life transformation. I argue that resonance has different properties to the more traditional interpretation of relevance and provides a better system of explanation of what it means to experience relevance. I show how traditional approaches to relevance and resonance work in a complementary fashion and outline how resonance may present distinct new lines of research into relevance theory."
466,E,"Journals play a critical role in the scientific process because they evaluate the quality of incoming papers and offer an organizing filter for search. However, the role of journals has been called into question because new preprint archives and academic search engines make it easier to find articles independent of the journals that publish them. Research on this issue is complicated by the deeply confounded relationship between article quality and journal reputation. We present an innovative proxy for individual article quality that is divorced from the journal's reputation or impact factor: the number of citations to preprints posted on . Using this measure to study three subfields of physics that were early adopters of arXiv, we show that prior estimates of the effect of journal reputation on an individual article's impact (measured by citations) are likely inflated. While we find that higher-quality preprints in these subfields are now less likely to be published in journals compared to prior years, we find little systematic evidence that the role of journal reputation on article performance has declined."
467,E,"Social media metrics have a genuine networked nature, reflecting the networking characteristics of the social media platform from where they are derived. This networked nature has been relatively less explored in the literature on altmetrics, although new network-level approaches are starting to appear. A general conceptualization of the role of social media networks in science communication, and particularly of social media as a specific type of interface between science and society, is still missing. The aim of this paper is to provide a conceptual framework for appraising interactions between science and society in multiple directions, in what we call heterogeneous couplings. Heterogeneous couplings are conceptualized as the co-occurrence of science and non-science objects, actors, and interactions in online media environments. This conceptualization provides a common framework to study the interactions between science and non-science actors as captured via online and social media platforms. The conceptualization of heterogeneous couplings opens wider opportunities for the development of network applications and analyses of the interactions between societal and scholarly entities in social media environments, paving the way toward more advanced forms of altmetrics, social (media) studies of science, and the conceptualization and operationalization of more advanced science-society studies."
468,E,"The classification of Western art music is a complex area of knowledge organization, yet the reasons for those complexities have not been fully studied. This research dissects the concept of orthogonality, in particular regard to music classification. Orthogonality (antonym: dependency) means that one facet acts independently from another facet. Although orthogonality is an assumed quality of facets, it has attracted relatively little attention in knowledge organization discourse. This research utilizes bibliographic classification schemes, musicological writings, and musical works to analyze orthogonality in music classification. The relationships between the medium, form/genre, and function facets are unpicked and a strong dependency is found between these facets. Whether this orthogonality exists as a construct of faceted classification or stems from the domain knowledge is explored. Furthermore, the analysis initiates new thinking about the general concept of orthogonality. The idea of a spectrum of dependency is proposed. In addition, novel, orthogonality-derived phenomena are discussed-""""dynamic facets"""" and """"meta-dependency""""-where the boundary between what is and is not a facet is blurred. The concluding model visualizes the chain of dependencies between music facets, ultimately showing how the lack of orthogonality plays a key role in the complexity and issues found in music classification."
469,E,"The premise of manual keyphrase annotation is to read the corresponding content of an annotated object. Intuitively, when we read, more important words will occupy a longer reading time. Hence, by leveraging human reading time, we can find the salient words in the corresponding content. However, previous studies on keyphrase extraction ignore human reading features. In this article, we aim to leverage human reading time to extract keyphrases from microblog posts. There are two main tasks in this study. One is to determine how to measure the time spent by a human on reading a word. We use eye fixation durations (FDs) extracted from an open source eye-tracking corpus. Moreover, we propose strategies to make eye FD more effective on keyphrase extraction. The other task is to determine how to integrate human reading time into keyphrase extraction models. We propose two novel neural network models. The first is a model in which the human reading time is used as the ground truth of the attention mechanism. In the second model, we use human reading time as the external feature. Quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our proposed models yield better performance than the baseline models on two microblog datasets."
470,F,"Taking listed companies of strategic emerging industries as the research subject, this paper uses KZ index to measure the degrees of financing constraints and financial intermediary as well as the stock market to represent the level of financial development. Then empirical models are constructed to analyse whether financial development can alleviate the financing constraints of R&D investment or not. Finally, the paper further investigates the interaction of financial development and firm characteristics (including firm size, ownership nature and establishment time) on the impact of R&D investment. The results show that the degree of financing constraint is negatively correlated with R&D investment. Both the development of financial intermediary and stock market play an important role in alleviating the R&D financing constraints, and the development of the stock market can better alleviate the R&D financing constraint. Moreover, the development of financial intermediary and stock market plays a heterogeneous role among enterprises of different size, nature and time of establishment. In order to achieve the 13th Five-year Plan target of strategic emerging industries in China, the government and enterprises need to work together to improve the financial development level and reduce information asymmetry, so as to expand the investment channels of R&D investment and improve their innovation capability and competitiveness."
471,F,"Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is a relative measure of efficiency applied to a set of decision units and is being used more and more frequently in the supermarket sector. Nonetheless, given how strongly the sector's financials depend on demand, companies need to combine this measurement with trade area information to best manage corporate efficiency. In this paper, the proposal consists of integrating DEA with a clearly articulated, structural typology so that supermarkets, based on their particular characteristics, can determine which variables are most critical for improving their efficiency. This methodology has been validated in the case of one of Spain's five largest supermarket chains. A principal component analysis and a classification analysis were carried out on a series of internal management variables from 61 locations for which DEA had been used to calculate efficiency and to which multiple trade area variables were added using GIS. Some of them are related to the loyalty scheme membership programme. These latter variables described the implantation of the loyalty scheme member programme and were revealed as key elements for the efficiency of the supermarket. This methodology provides marketing profiles that are more adapted to local circumstances, thus allowing companies to set better internal benchmarking objectives."
472,F,"The request of equal accessibility must be respected to some extent when dealing with problems of designing or rebuilding of emergency service systems. Not only the disutility of the average user but also the disutility of the worst situated user must be taken into consideration. Respecting this principle is called fairness of system design. Unfairness can be mitigated to a certain extent by an appropriate fair allocation of additional facilities among the centers. In this article, two criteria of collective fairness are defined in the connection with the facility allocation problem. To solve the problems, a series of fast algorithms for solving of the allocation problem was suggested. This article extends the family of the original solving techniques based on branch-and-bound principle by newly suggested techniques, which exploit either dynamic programming principle or convexity and monotony of decreasing nonlinearities in objective functions. The resulting algorithms were tested and compared performing numerical experiments with real-sized problem instances. The new proposed algorithms outperform the original approach. The suggested methods are able to solve general min-sum and min-max problems, in which a limited number of facilities should be assigned to individual members from a finite set of providers."
473,F,"The aim of presented study is to evaluate macroeconomic environment and to determine differences in perception of macroeconomic environment by entrepreneurs in Slovak Republic and Czech Republic. Data collection was done by questionnaire which was answered by 329 entrepreneurs from Slovak Republic and 312 entrepreneurs from Czech Republic. Topics treated concerning macroenvironment were the favourableness of macroenvironment for business activities, its support for starting an entrepreneurship, its support of innovation activities of companies and its capacity to promote entrepreneurship and to create interesting business opportunities. Answers are divided according to sector in which entrepreneurs doing business. Considered sectors are: transport, trade, construction, production, agriculture, services and other sectors. To analyse collected data, we use correspondence analysis. Results show that there exists systematic difference in perception of macroenvironment by entrepreneurs from SMEs in Slovak Republic and Czech Republic. It seems that entrepreneurs from Czech Republic percept macroenvironment more positively than Slovak ones. Moreover, we document different perception of macroeconomic situation depending on sector in which entrepreneurs operate. Presented research results bring findings for the creators of economic policies. Similarly, presented results form a platform for concepts of strategic and regional plans in order to provide sustainable business environment in the countries, and also their stable economic growth."
474,F,"Regional policy of the countries - reducing disparities between economic development of the regions - has been, is and will continue to be the focus of policy makers' attention, therefore it is important to assess regional conditions qualitatively and to spot the differences in the change of these condition. This would be the basis for developing targeted strategies for further regional development. The process of regional economic development may be assessed quantitatively and qualitatively. The integrated mean of the statistical indicators reflects the dynamics of development. The paper's objective is to develop an aggregate indicator of development dynamics and to quantify the dynamics of the economic development of the Polish and Lithuanian regions. The employed methodological approach is based on the authors' definition of the mean of regional economic development equilibrium. The analysis of the statistical characteristics of the indicators of three regions of Poland and Lithuania has shown that the dynamics of economic development in the regions of both countries is similar. On the other hand, Poland is characterized by a more intensive development, while the development of Lithuanian regions is more levelled."
475,F,"This paper is focused on the financial situation of companies entering insolvency proceedings. It does not work with all kinds of the insolvent companies, but this paper concentrates on one specific issue. The issue is pre-pack insolvencies. The main aim is to show if the financial situation is an important factor for consent to pre-pack. The pre-pack insolvencies are insolvency cases which start with an insolvency proposal which is accompanied by a reorganization plan already approved by creditors. Prepacks should help make the insolvency process quicker and enable enterprise financial rehabilitation and sustain the going concern principle. On the other hand, the procedure can hardly be successful when the financial situation of the company is extremely poor. Therefore this paper evaluates the financial situation of the companies with pre-packed insolvency in the Czech Republic. The analysis of companies was conducted over one, two or three year periods prior to the companies entering an insolvency proceeding. According to the literature, financial indicators used for evaluation are commonly EBITDA, cash liquidity, debt ratio, ROA and the Altman Z-Score prediction model. Results for the individual enterprises are summed up in this paper using basic descriptive and variable statistics. Conclusions have especially practical implications because they show financial inability of majority pre-packed cases."
476,F,"The aim of the paper is to assess the effect of discretionary accruals on firm growth while controlling for firm characteristics and macroeconomic environment. Employing a large sample of 1.105 young and high-growth firms (gazelles) from 15 emerging European countries over the period 2006-2014, it has been found that the discretionary accruals negatively influence firm growth. The empirical results suggest that discretionary accruals are used as earnings management tools and this practice is more used over the high-growth period (2006-2009), with negative effects on future performance. Furthermore, the results of the quantile regression employed in the whole period suggest that the earnings management practices have a negative effect on firm growth. The results prove to be robust for different estimation approaches and different sub-samples of gazelles. The findings provide empirical evidence for the need for more detailed information provided by firms on the origin of the accruals, as well as for the use in the performance analysis of some indicators that eliminate the influence of accruals, such as cash flow based ratios."
477,F,"It is essential to look at financial crises from both theoretical and practical aspects, as this is an old and recurring phenomenon. However, it is still unknown how to manage their formation. The article aims at assessing the influence of individuals' financial decisions on financial crisis formation. The interface between economic decisions made by individuals and financial crises is assessed using expert evaluation method. The multi-criteria estimation performed using the TOPSIS method to evaluate when individuals make the most irrational decisions. Moreover, finally, economic decisions rationality index is concluded, evaluating when individuals make ridiculous decisions. The rationality index of economic decisions measures the number of irrational decisions during the economic expansion. Economic decisions rationality index divided into three groups: economic factors, financial sector and psychological factors. Assessment of the irrational decisions made during the economic expansion demonstrates that during the first period (2001-2006) the least irrational decisions were made in 2001 and the most in 2004; while during the second period (2010-2017), the least irrational decisions were made in 2011 and the most in 2015. The limitation of the research is that the data is accessible only for the US; hence, the results could differ in other countries."
478,F,"The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the influence of environmental, social and governance performance on the economic performance of the Standard & Poor's 500 companies. Structural equation modeling and linear regression have been utilized to measure the overall and individual influence of environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance on economic performance using longitudinal data comprising the years from 2010 to 2015. The overall ESG model had a significant relationship on economic performance. Furthermore, the findings of this study show that social and governance performance significantly affects economic performance in all regression models. However, environmental performance failed to show a significant relationship. The research contributes to the literature by providing insights for investors, managers and employees about the influence of ESG performance on company performance."
479,F,"The study investigates the impact of trade openness on pollution in China by applying wavelet-coherence analysis, phase-difference technique and Breitung and Candelon (2006) causality test. The estimated results provide some dynamic association between trade openness and pollutant variables. The results indicate that trade openness has increased pollution in China especially after 2001 when China became member of WTO. It suggests that """"pollution haven hypothesis"""" exists in China. These results imply that trade openness has increased exports which has increased domestic production by increasing the scale of industries, which in turn has increased pollution in the country. The findings of spectral domain causality test show that trade openness causes carbon emission both in short, medium and long runs. It indicates that trade openness forecast carbon emissions in China. The results suggest that China should take suitable measures while following trade openness policy to avoid pollution."
480,F,"While many studies have examined the relationship between investment in intangibles assets and performance in large corporations, current research is lacking in regard to intangible investments in small and medium enterprises (SMEs). This study looks at SMEs in which intangible investments would usually be minor because they tend to consider intangible investment as an inefficient cost and concentrate on investments in tangible assets. This paper aims to contribute to the current literature and suggests that investment in the intangible assets of (human capital, advertising, R&D) is essential for SMEs pursuing superior firm performance. Actual data collected from 173 SMEs in Korea were analyzed employing hierarchical regression methodology. Results indicate that all three intangible resources have a positive effect on a firm's profitability and value. Interestingly, this research finds that investment in advertising has the most influential impact on a firm's profitability and value. This study has implications for SMEs in achieving their profitability and value. The results in this study highlight that intangible investment is not a waste of money for SMEs, and that business managers could strategically utilize these three key contributors (human capital, advertising, R&D) and adopt investment in intangible assets to accomplish their managerial goals."
481,F,"The study aimed to find factors affecting the development of trust-based cooperative relationships and test the links between them. For this study, the research framework was based on the notion that a cooperative relationship in a supply chain required commitment, cooperation and trust among the supply chain partners, with trust as a critical element. The other assumption was that the selection of partners with specific qualities was conducive to building cooperative relationships. The research was conducted on a sample of 226 companies using the CATI technique. In the study structural equation modelling was used. The obtained results confirmed the positive impact of partner qualities on trust and adaptation, of adaptation on commitment, of trust on cooperation and commitment, and of commitment on cooperation. New measurement scales were used that expanded the range of factors that affect the successful building of trust-based cooperative relationships in a supply chain."
482,F,"The main objective of this research is to analyse the relationship between the board of director' structure of the banks from the Romanian bank sector, the capital demands and the risk management in what concerns these relationships. Regarding the structure of the board of directors, their size is under the loop, alongside with the education of its members, the gender diversity and the members nationality. The indicators concerning the capital demand that are subject of this research are the solvency and the level of the total own funds of the banks and the ones expressing the risk management are represented by the total exposure of weighted assets according to the risk (RWA), the credit risk exposure, the market risk and the operational risk. The authors have tried to answer the question: Is there or is not a direct relationship between the top of the range board of directors structure and the risk management for the banks from the Romanian bank sector? To answer this question, the used methodology is mainly quantitatively, having as core the deductive statistical analysis, testing and identifying connections from the effect and cause category, considering also the significance level."
483,F,"The implementation of Industry 4.0 concept brings many risks mainly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The objective of the study is a diagnosis and comparison of the perception of selected risk issues connected with Industry 4.0 implementation in Slovak and Polish SMEs, which have knowledge or experience with cluster cooperation. This category of SMEs is specific due to the fact, that not all of the SMEs have experience with cluster cooperation or know this form of doing business. For this purpose, the questionnaire survey of 787 respondents was conducted, focused on the risks of Industry 4.0 that are the most important for SMEs included in three categories: technical readiness, risks of innovation and risks of information. The statistical analysis of the survey results with the application of software STATISTICA and Social Science Statistics calculator leads to the conclusion that, except for the kind of risk of """"New products and services"""", all the observed risks are perceived as higher by Slovak SMEs than by Polish SMEs. The novelty of this research and its contribution to the body of knowledge lies in identification and evaluation of most important risks for specific group of SMEs related to Industry 4.0 implementation compared in two countries. The results of this research provide useful information for the practical fine-tuning of the policy aimed at transfer to Industry 4.0 in specific field - cluster cooperation, depending on the size of the enterprise."
484,F,"This work aims to shed new light on the relation between institutional performance and firm dynamics. Considering the Italian manufacturing industry and a panel of 3 years, the authors investigate the relation between the time needed by courts to enforce debtors' obligations and the time needed by enterprises to repay their debts. In particular, we test the hypothesis that efficiency in settling mortgage foreclosure and bankruptcy cases can affect the creditors' decision making on judicial disputes. According to our thesis, inordinately long waiting times to enforce credit rights may increase the contractual strength of debtors, further delaying payments. As shown by our results, there is a statistically significant positive relation between the enforcement of debtors' obligations and the adopted payment index, confirming the key role of the judiciary in the dynamics of firms. Indeed, if the time needed to settle bankruptcy cases decreases by 25%, we can expect the payment index to decrease by 1%; while, focusing on foreclosure cases, we can expect the payment index to decrease by 2%. The policy implications of these results are rather compelling. Policy makers could reform foreclosure and bankruptcy procedures to support national economic growth, without additional burden on the public budget."
485,F,"The paper deals with the environmental costs (EC) in the electrical equipment industry by using environmental accounting as a strategic instrument for controlling the economic entity (EE). The novelty of the study consists of integrating a mathematical model in environmental management accounting (EMA), starting from the identification of the types of waste generated by the production flow and the interaction between the production activity and the environment, which results in determining the EC per entity. The research also analyzes the dependence between the resulting waste and the volume of production by categories. The usefulness of determining these dependencies leads to the identification of the product categories with a significant influence on the EC. The study is useful for developing an environmentally sustainable accounting system within entities in the electrical equipment industry because based on the mathematical model, products that generate large quantities of waste can be identified, allowing the outline of managerial strategies to reviewing production technologies, in order to optimize the products and reduce the quantities of waste generated."
486,F,"Due to the economic trends around the world and the strong support and guidance of relevant governments, the number of entrepreneurial projects has soared in China. It is necessary to construct a standard assessment system for entrepreneurial projects that is comprehensive and effective. This study extracted six dimensions and 23 criteria for evaluating entrepreneurial projects. This study applies the best and worst methods to obtain the weights of the dimensions and criteria. Then, the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution method was used to evaluate the entrepreneurial projects in an entrepreneurial competition. The results show that team quality, the business model and entrepreneurship ability are the three most important dimensions for evaluating entrepreneurial projects. The improvement of the innovating ability, the training of the team and the value proposition are the three keys to successful implementation of the entrepreneurial projects."
487,F,"Economic policy drives investment, production, employment, and other macroeconomic indicators of the economy. The study examines the equity, commodity, interest rates, and currency markets, taking into consideration the US economic policy uncertainty (EPU) index. The present work determines the association among policy uncertainty and volatility index, expressed in terms of generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity and period of empirical work spanning from 2000 to 2018. The results suggest that equity markets' volatility tends to be very high based on a high degree of policy uncertainty. The findings on the commodity market indicate that crude oil and gold prices remain more volatile during the presidential election and financial crisis. One of the essential results shows that the 2000s boom, early credit crunch, Lehman's collapse and recession, and fiscal policy battles have significantly affected the equity, currency, and commodity markets. The interest rates and currency markets have responded considerably to Feds' and EPU index. The empirical outcome provides evidence that implied volatility index is a forward looking expectation of future stock market volatility, and it uncovers that policy uncertainty affects investor sentiment. The present work holds some practical implications for the government to formulate policies to regulate the US market."
488,F,"Our study aims to bridge the gap between contemporary studies on financial cycles and the financial instability hypothesis in the form of a Minsky cycle (Minsky, 1963). Paper contribution range from explored causality links (financial cycles cause business cycles) to the empirical estimation of the Minsky moment. We use Braitung and Candelon (2006) Granger causality test and discrete threshold model (Hansen, 2005) to the link between financial and business cycles in the UK from 1270-2016. Financial and business cycles relation varies over time with contemporary financial cycles being longer to their historical versions. Financial cycles lead business cycles. Business cycles are an economy reaction to them and change in the Minsky moment. Minsky moment has a statistically significant impact on main growth determinants - population, export, technology. Policymakers should look for the Minsky moment when setting up a new economic policy to assure it will be an effective one."
489,F,"Significant disparities still exist between regions of the European Union, even though substantial Cohesion investments are directed to address this issue. To adjust the Cohesion Policy (CP), researchers assess the returns of the CP, but almost all studies are carried out at NUTS1&2 or a country level, even though significant disparities occur at NUTS3 level. Moreover, just a few studies examine the non-linear effects of the CP, and none of them covers the NUTS3 disaggregation level. Filling the gap of previous contributions, the paper aims to investigate convergence outcomes of the CP at NUTS2&3 level and to identify whether the marginal effect of the CP is diminishing. The estimation strategy is based on the modified specification of the difference-in-differences estimator that has an advantage while examining policy effects, using non-experimental data. Based on research findings, the essential guidelines for the improvement of the CP can be drawn up: i) the distribution policy of Cohesion investments should focus on smaller territorial units to reduce disparities at NUTS3 level; ii) the intensity of the CP's transfers has to be optimised because excessive intensity does not provide a positive return."
490,G,"Objectives: Surveillance for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) has been undertaken in the UK since September 2012. This study describes the surveillance outcomes in England from 2012 to 2018. Study design: This was a descriptive study using surveillance data. Methods: Local health protection teams in England report possible MERS cases to the National Infection Service with clinical and laboratory data. Results: A total of 1301 possible MERS cases were identified in the study period. Five cases were laboratory-confirmed MERS. The majority of cases had travelled to Saudi Arabia (56.7%) and United Arab Emirates (25.9%). Fifty-four percent of cases were men and 43.7% were women. The majority of cases (65.1%) were aged 45 years or older. The number of tests increased in the period after Hajj each year. Laboratory-confirmed alternative diagnoses were available for 513 (39.4%) cases; influenza was the most common virus detected (n = 255, 52.4%). Conclusions: Our study highlights the importance of differential diagnosis of influenza and other respiratory pathogens and early influenza antiviral treatment.

491,G,"Objective: The aim of the study was to identify factors predicting laboratory-positive coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pediatric patients with acute respiratory symptoms. Study design: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of a prospective cohort study. Methods: Data from 1849 individuals were analyzed. COVID-19 was confirmed (reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction) in 15.9% of patients, and factors predicting a positive test result were evaluated through prevalence odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Results: Increasing age, personal history of obesity, and household contact with a case were found to be associated, in the multiple regression model, with increased odds of a positive test result. Young patients residing in areas with higher population sizes, as well as those with severe respiratory symptoms, were less likely to be laboratory confirmed. Conclusions: Early identification and isolation of children and teenagers with suggestive symptoms of COVID-19 is important to limit viral spread. We identified several factors predicting the laboratory test result. Our findings are relevant from a public health policy perspective, particularly after the restart of in-person academic activities. (C) 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health.

492,G,"Objectives: The first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted healthcare systems, creating an environment by which deaths have occurred that are not directly due to COVID-19, but have occurred owing to the healthcare and societal environment resulting from COVID-19. The objective of this research is to quantify such excess deaths, partitioned by age group and gender. Study design: This is a data analysis. Methods: Excess deaths by age and gender are estimated using provisional death data available from the Centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) over the time period from March 1, 2020 through May 30, 2020. Previous year fatality and population data are used as the benchmark. Results: Several of the eighteen age and gender cohorts experienced statistically significant excess deaths. The results also indicate that COVID-19 has been protective for one of the age and gender cohorts. Conclusions: There have been more excess deaths in several age group and gender cohorts during the first three months of the pandemic, beyond direct deaths directly attributable to COVID-19. These non -COVID-19 excess deaths are most apparent in the 25- to 44-year age group for women and 15- to 54-year age group for men. Further research is needed to assess the cause of such excess deaths and introduce safeguards to reduce such deaths in the future. (C) 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health.

493,G,"Objectives: This paper examines the relationship between unemployment and health using both subjective and biometric information on health status. Study design: Longitudinal panel data. Methods: We compare the results of regressions of unemployment on self-reported health with those of regressions of unemployment on health as measured with biomarkers (hypertension and levels of blood glucose and C-reactive protein). Using the panel structure of our data, we account for selection bias with respect to unemployment by controlling for health before exposure to unemployment. Results: We observe a striking pattern. Using self-reported health as the outcome variable, we find a link between unemployment and worse health. By contrast, we are unable to establish the same link using biometric information on health. Conclusion: In conclusion, our results indicate a substantial discrepancy between self-reported health and health as measured by biomarkers. (C) 2019 The Royal Society for Public Health.

494,G,"Objectives: The purpose of this study was to define and delineate specific non-technical competencies for first-line public health responders in Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) emergencies in China. Study design: A qualitative study was conducted in China involving interviews with key informants in the field of health response to CBRN disasters. Methods: One-on-one in-depth interviews were carried out with 20 participants, including expert members of National Medical Response Teams for CBRN disasters, officials at emergency management authorities, and scholars of academic institutions related to CBRN emergency. Interviews were recorded using audio equipment, transcribed, and coded into codable passages as per grounded theory using NVivo software. Themes were identified within the transcriptions by using thematic analysis. Results: A total of 159 codable passages were produced. Eight domains of non-technical core competencies were identified: (1) situation awareness, (2) communication skills, (3) collaboration, (4) resource management, (5) task management, (6) cultural competency, (7) austere environment skills, and (8) physical stamina. Conclusions: The study identified a variety of competencies for on-scene public health responders in CBRN emergencies. The findings of this study could specifically benefit development of strategy and improvement of content of education and training. Further research that involves input from the disaster response community at large is needed for the validation of these competencies.

495,G,"Objectives: The number of people testing positive for Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) in the UK, particularly among young adults, is increasing. We report here on the mental health of young adults and related psychological and behavioural responses to the pandemic and consider the role of these factors in fuelling the increase in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in this group. Methods: An online survey was completed during the first six weeks of the first UK-wide lockdown by 3097 respondents, including data for 364 respondents aged 18-24 years. The survey included measures of mental health and indices capturing related psychological and behavioural responses to the pandemic. Results: The mental health of 18- to 24-years-olds in the first 6 weeks of lockdown was significantly poorer than that of older respondents and previously published norms: with 84% reporting symptoms of depression and 72% reporting symptoms of anxiety. Young adults also reported significantly greater loneliness and reduced positive mood, both of which were also associated with greater mental health difficulties. Conclusions: We contend that the combination of mental health, social and economic considerations may have contributed to the rise of COVID-19 infections in young adults, and ascribing blame to this group will not aid our efforts to regain control of the disease.

496,G,"Objectives: Transgender-identifying sex workers (TGISWs) are among the most vulnerable groups but are rarely the focus of health research. Here we evaluated perceived barriers to healthcare access, risky sexual behaviours and exposure to violence in the United Kingdom (UK), based on a survey of all workers on BirchPlace, the main transgender sex commerce website in the UK. Study design: The study design used in the study is an opt-in text-message 12-item questionnaire. Methods: Telephone contacts were harvested from BirchPlace's website (n = 592 unique and active numbers). The questionnaire was distributed with Qualtrics software, resulting in 53 responses. Results: Our survey revealed significant reported barriers to healthcare access, exposure to risky sexual behaviours and to physical violence. Many transgender sex workers reportedly did not receive a sexual screening, and 28% engaged in condomless penetrative sex within the preceding six months, and 68% engaged in condomless oral sex. 17% responded that they felt unable to access health care they believed medically necessary. Half of the participants suggested their quality of life would be improved by law reform. Conclusions: TGISWs report experiencing a high level of risky sexual behaviour, physical violence and inadequate healthcare access. Despite a National Health System, additional outreach may be needed to ensure access to services by this population. (c) 2020 The Authors.

497,G,"Objectives: This study aims to assess adequacy in micronutrient intake in comparison with reference nutrient intakes (RNI) and to identify differences in intakes between normal weight and overweight individuals. Study design: A sample of 542 university students (18-25 years), normal weight (N = 369) and overweight (N = 173), were included in a cross-sectional study. Methods: A three-day diet diary was used to assess energy and nutrient intake. Body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference were measured. Results: Mean dietary vitamin D intake was lower than RNI in both men (4.44 mu g) and women (5.04 mu g). Mean intakes of calcium (597.44 mg), iron (8.62 mg) and folate (171.29 mg) were also lower than recommendations in women. Weight status (normal weight versus overweight) was significantly associated with micronutrient intake, and a trend towards a decrease in vitamin and mineral intake with increasing weight was noted. Conclusions: Results suggest the need to increase the intake of some micronutrients to meet the RNI, to ensure optimal health. This study provides a helpful tool to reinforce recommendations and potential health promotion and intervention strategies in university settings and could influence manufacturers involved in new food product development targeted to this young population.

498,D,"East Africa experiences chronic food insecurity, with levels varying from year-to-year across the region. Given that much can be done to prevent this level of suffering before it happens, humanitarian agencies monitor early indicators of food insecurity to trigger early action. Forecasts of total seasonal rainfall are one tool used to monitor and anticipate food security outcomes. Factors beyond rainfall, such as conflict, are key determinants of whether lack of rainfall can become a problem. In this paper, we present a quantitative analysis that isolates the value of rainfall information in anticipating food security outcomes across livelihood groups in East Africa. Comparing observed rainfall and temperature with food security classifications, we quantify how much the chance of food insecurity increases when rainfall is low. Results differed dramatically among livelihood groups; pastoralists in East Africa more frequently experience food insecurity than do non-pastoralists, and 12months of low rainfall greatly increases the chances of crisis and emergency food security in pastoralist regions. In non-pastoralist regions, the relationship with total rainfall is not as strong. Similar results were obtained for livelihood groups in Kenya and Ethiopia, with slightly differing results in Somalia. Given this, we evaluated the relevance of monitoring and forecasting seasonal total rainfall. Our quantitative results demonstrate that six months of rainfall observations can already indicate a heightened risk of food insecurity, a full six months before conditions deteriorate. Combining rainfall observations with seasonal forecasts can further change the range of possible outcomes to indicate higher or lower risk of food insecurity, but the added value of seasonal forecasts is noticeable only when they show a strong probability of below-normal rainfall."
499,D,"If future rice production is to contribute to food security for the increasing population of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), effective strategies are needed to control weeds, the crop's fiercest competitors for resources. To gain better insights into farmers' access to, and use of, herbicides as part of weed control strategies, surveys were conducted in key rice production locations across SSA. Farm surveys were held among 1965 farmers across 20 countries to collect data on rice yields, farmer's weed management practices, herbicide use, frequencies of interventions and information sources regarding herbicides. Markets were surveyed across 17 countries to collect data on herbicide availability, brand names and local prices (converted to US$ ha(-1)). Herbicides are used by 34% of the rice farmers in SSA, but adoption ranges from 0 to 72% across countries. Herbicides are more often used by men (40%) than by women (27%) and more often in irrigated (44% of farmers) than in rainfed lowland (36%) or upland rice growing environments (24%). Herbicides are always used supplementary to hand weeding. Following this combination, yield loss reductions in irrigated lowlands and rainfed uplands are estimated to be 0.4tha(-1) higher than hand weeding alone. In rainfed lowlands no benefits were observed from herbicide use. Sixty-two percent of the herbicides sold at rural agro-chemical supply markets are unauthorized. These markets are dominated by glyphosate and 2,4-D, sold under 55 and 41 different brand names, respectively, and at relatively competitive prices (below average herbicide price of US $17ha(-1)). They are also the most popular herbicides among farmers. For advice on herbicide application methods, farmers primarily rely on their peers, and only a few receive advice from extension services (<23%) or inform themselves by reading the product label (<16%). Herbicide application timings are therefore often (38%) sub-optimal. Herbicide technologies can contribute to reduced production losses in rice in SSA. However, through negative effects on crop, environment and human health, incorrect herbicide use may unintentionally counteract efforts to increase food security. Moving away from this status quo will require strict implementation and monitoring of national pesticide regulations and investment in research and development to innovate and diversify the currently followed weed management strategies, agricultural service provision and communications with farmers."
500,D,"The livestock sector is a major driver of climate change, accounting for 14.5% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Population growth and rising prosperity are expected to see global consumption of meat rise by 76% by mid-century, a rate which is associated with significant social and environmental costs. There is therefore a compelling case for public measures to promote dietary shifts towards a more sustainable model, but little action has been taken at the international or national level. This article reports on an international study, with research conducted across the UK, US, China and Brazil, which examines the role the media might play in driving social change in this area. The study focused specifically on the negotiation of new information around meat consumption and climate change and its impacts on existing attitudes and behaviours. Findings indicate that perceptions and beliefs on climate change are culturally specific - tending to reflect national political and social priorities - but are contextualised within individually constructed media environments. Key determining factors include assessments of trust and credibility in regard to scientists and other experts, perceptions of the role of government and questions of individual versus collective responsibility. These shape the parameters within which arguments about the impact of meat consumption upon climate change are received, and these responses interact with cultural and structural barriers and opportunities to shape the likelihood of behaviour change."
501,D,"Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is the second most consumed staple food crop after maize in Africa and is the main food security crop after maize in Zambia. A study, aimed at analyzing cassava processing and utilization at household level in Zambia, was conducted. Surveys were conducted in five districts (Kasama, Samfya, Mansa, Serenje and Kaoma). A structured questionnaire was administered to a total of 300 randomly selected households. The percentage of households that were involved in processing were 4.3% for income, 34% for consumption and 58% for both income generation and consumption. Levels of awareness and usage of improved cassava processing methods across the districts were low, ranging between 20% and 26%. The only improved processing equipment that farmers used often (69%) was the hammer mill. Product development and utilization were still at a low level (ranging between 9% and 18%) in Zambia. Cassava is mostly consumed in its traditional form for its leaves, as a snack, and for preparing nshima (cassava flour alone or a mixture of cassava and maize meal, called maize-cassava nshima). The limited knowledge of cassava products' diversity and the low usage of improved equipment are challenges to the production of confectionery products that could lead to increased cassava consumption. There has been no significant change over the last two decades in cassava processing and product development, which could spur cassava development. This calls for more efforts to support Government policy in diversifying crop use and crop diversification in order to create wealth."
502,D,"Households combine capital assets in a process involving human agency and resourcefulness to construct livelihood strategies and generate well-being outcomes. Here, we (1) characterized types of livelihood strategies; (2) determined how different capital assets are associated with different livelihood strategies; and (3) determined how livelihood strategies differed in food security outcomes. We conducted a survey in southwestern Ethiopia and used principal component and cluster analyses. Five types of livelihood strategies, which differed mainly in food and cash crops comprising the strategy, were identified. These were, in order of decreasing food security: three food crops, coffee and khat', n=68; three food crops and khat', n=59; two food crops, coffee and khat', n=78; two food crops and khat', n=88; and one food crop, coffee and khat', n=44. The livelihood strategy three food crops, coffee and khat' was associated with a wide range of capital assets, particularly having larger aggregate farm field size and learning from other farmers. A generalized linear model showed that livelihood strategies were significantly associated with food security outcomes. Particularly, a high number of food crops in a strategy was linked with relatively high food security. In this context, diversified livelihood strategies primarily through having a mix of food crops for subsistence, in combination with cash crops for income, are important for food security. This suggests a need to rethink dominant policy narratives, which have a narrow focus on increasing productivity and commercialization as the primary pathway to food security."
503,D,"Maize plays an important role in the livelihoods of rural communities in Rwanda. However, maize yields are threatened by the presence of pests and diseases and a general lack of knowledge and information for their management. In this study we sought to assess if plant clinics are making farmers more aware and knowledgeable of pests and diseases and are indirectly contributing to higher yields. We interviewed 644 farmers across Rwanda, both users and non-users of plant clinics. Propensity score matching was used to match the users and non-users of plant clinics and logistic regression was used to assess a number of factors, including interactions with plant clinics, that affect farmers' adoption of pest management practices. Our analysis shows that users of plant clinics are more aware and knowledgeable in recognizing and handling maize stem borers. Furthermore, users of plant clinics have on average higher yields than non-users and this difference is highly significant (P<0.001). The analysis therefore demonstrates that plant clinics are beneficial to farmers in Rwanda. However, efforts are required to diversify the spectrum of practices that are promoted by plant clinics and by extension and advisory services in Rwanda."
504,C,"Low-frequency (nu less than or similar to 150 MHz) stellar radio emission is expected to originate in the outer corona at heights comparable to and larger than the stellar radius. Such emission from the Sun has been used to study coronal structure, mass ejections and space-weather conditions around the planets(1). Searches for low-frequency emission from other stars have detected only a single active flare star(2) that is not representative of the wider stellar population. Here we report the detection of low-frequency radio emission from a quiescent star, GJ 1151-a member of the most common stellar type (red dwarf or spectral class M) in the Galaxy. The characteristics of the emission are similar to those of planetary auroral emissions(3) (for example, Jupiter's decametric emission), suggesting a coronal structure dominated by a global magnetosphere with low plasma density. Our results show that large-scale currents that power radio aurorae operate over a vast range of mass and atmospheric composition, ranging from terrestrial planets to main-sequence stars. The Poynting flux required to produce the observed radio emission cannot be generated by GJ 1151's slow rotation, but can originate in a sub-Alfvenic interaction of its magnetospheric plasma with a short-period exoplanet. The emission properties are consistent with theoretical expectations(4-7) for interaction with an Earth-size planet in an approximately one- to five-day-long orbit. Low-frequency radio emission from a normally quiescent M dwarf star suggests a radio aurora generated by the interaction between the stellar corona and an undetected Earth-sized planet."
505,C,"Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are extragalactic X-ray emitters located off-centre of their host galaxy and with a luminosity in excess of a few 10(39) erg s(-1), if emitted isotropically(1,2). The discovery of periodic modulation revealed that in some ULXs the accreting compact object is a neutron star(3-7), indicating luminosities substantially above their Eddington limit. The most extreme object in this respect is NGC 5907 ULX-1 (ULX1), with a peak luminosity that is 500 times its Eddington limit. During a Chandra observation to probe a low state of ULX1, we detected diffuse X-ray emission at the position of ULX1. Its diameter is 2.7 +/- 1.0 arcsec and contains 25 photons, none below 0.8 keV. We interpret this extended structure as an expanding nebula powered by the wind of ULX1. Its diameter of about 200 pc, characteristic energy of similar to 1.9 keV and luminosity of similar to 2 x 10(38) erg s(-1) imply a mechanical power of 1.3 x 10(41) erg s(-1) and an age of similar to 7 x 10(4) yr. This interpretation suggests that a genuinely super-Eddington regime can be sustained for timescales much longer than the spin-up time of the neutron star powering the system. As the mechanical power from a single ULX nebula can rival the injection rate of cosmic rays of an entire galaxy(8), ULX nebulae could be important cosmic ray accelerators(9)."
506,C,"Globular clusters (GCs) are thought to be ancient relics from the early formative phase of galaxies, although their physical origin remains uncertain(1,2). GCs are most numerous around massive elliptical galaxies, where they can exhibit a broad colour dispersion, suggesting a wide metallicity spread(3). Here, we show that many thousands of compact and massive (similar to 5 x 10(3)-3 x 10(6) M-circle dot) star clusters have formed at an approximately steady rate over, at least, the past similar to 1 Gyr around NGC 1275, the central giant elliptical galaxy of the Perseus cluster. Beyond similar to 1 Gyr, these star clusters are indistinguishable in broadband optical colours from the more numerous GCs. Their number distribution exhibits a similar dependence with luminosity and mass as the GCs, whereas their spatial distribution resembles a filamentary network of multiphase gas(4,5) associated with cooling of the intracluster gas(6,7). The sustained formation of these star clusters demonstrates that progenitor GCs can form over cosmic history from cooled intracluster gas, thus contributing to both the large number and broad colour dispersion-owing to an age spread, in addition to a spread in metallicity-of GCs in massive elliptical galaxies. The progenitor GCs have minimal masses well below the maximal masses of Galactic open star clusters, affirming a common formation mechanism for star clusters over all mass scales(8-10) irrespective of their formative pathways."
507,C,"Our Galaxy's disk is warped, and that warp is dynamic. Here, Poggio et al. measure the rate of precession of the Galaxy's warp using a large sample of giant stars. Rather than primordial, the rate of precession indicates that the Milky Way acquired its warp during a recent or even ongoing encounter with another galaxy. In a cosmological setting, the disk of a galaxy is expected to continuously experience gravitational torques and perturbations from a variety of sources, which can cause the disk to wobble, flare and warp(1,2). Specifically, the study of galactic warps and their dynamic nature could reveal key information on the formation history of galaxies and the mass distribution of their haloes. Our Milky Way presents a unique case study for galactic warps, thanks to detailed knowledge of its stellar distribution and kinematics. Using a simple model of how the warp's orientation is changing with time, here, we measure the precession rate of the Milky Way's warp using 12 million giant stars from Gaia Data Release 2(3), finding that it is precessing at 10.86 +/- 0.03 (statistical) +/- 3.20 (systematic) km s(-1) kpc(-1) in the direction of Galactic rotation, about one-third the angular rotation velocity at the Sun's position in the Galaxy. The direction and magnitude of the warp's precession rate favour the scenario that the warp is the result of a recent or ongoing encounter with a satellite galaxy, rather than the relic of the ancient assembly history of the Galaxy."
508,C,"White dwarfs are dense, cooling stellar embers consisting mostly of carbon and oxygen(1), or oxygen and neon (with a few per cent carbon) at higher initial stellar masses(2). These stellar cores are enveloped by a shell of helium, which in turn, is usually surrounded by a layer of hydrogen, generally prohibiting direct observation of the interior composition. However, carbon is observed at the surface of a sizeable fraction of white dwarfs(3,4), sometimes with traces of oxygen, and is thought to be dredged up from the core by a deep helium convection zone(5,6). In these objects, only traces of hydrogen are found(7,8), as large masses of hydrogen are predicted to inhibit hydrogen-helium convective mixing within the envelope(9). We report the identification of WD J055134.612+413531.09, an ultra-massive (1.14 solar masses (M-circle dot)) white dwarf with a unique carbon-hydrogen mixed atmosphere (atomic ratio C/H = 0.15). Our analysis of the envelope and interior indicates that the total hydrogen and helium mass fractions must be several orders of magnitude lower than predictions of single-star evolution(10): less than 10(-9.5) and 10(-7.0), respectively. Due to the fast kinematics (129 +/- 5 km s(-1) relative to the local standard of rest), large mass and peculiar envelope composition, we argue that WD J0551+4135 is consistent with formation from the merger of two white dwarfs in a tight binary system(11-14). A massive white dwarf (WD) with unusually low hydrogen and helium abundances, undetectable oxygen and high C/H poses a challenge to single-star evolution models. However, this object fits with expectations of a WD-WD merger product."
509,C,"Radio observations of black hole MAXI J1820+070's 2018 outburst captured an isolated radio flare that the authors connect with the launch of bipolar relativistic ejecta. Following the oncoming ejecta for more than half a year reveals that black hole jet energetics have been systematically underestimated. Black holes in binary systems execute patterns of outburst activity where two characteristic X-ray states are associated with different behaviours observed at radio wavelengths. The hard state is associated with radio emission indicative of a continuously replenished, collimated, relativistic jet, whereas the soft state is rarely associated with radio emission, and never continuously, implying the absence of a quasi-steady jet. Here we report radio observations of the black hole transient MAXI J1820+070 during its 2018 outburst. As the black hole transitioned from the hard to soft state, we observed an isolated radio flare, which, using high-angular-resolution radio observations, we connect with the launch of bipolar relativistic ejecta. This flare occurs as the radio emission of the core jet is suppressed by a factor of over 800. We monitor the evolution of the ejecta over 200 days and to a maximum separation of 10 '', during which period it remains detectable due to in situ particle acceleration. Using simultaneous radio observations sensitive to different angular scales, we calculate an accurate estimate of energy content of the approaching ejection. This energy estimate is far larger than that derived from the state transition radio flare, suggesting a systematic underestimate of jet energetics."
510,C,"A detailed microphysical model shows that there are two distinct regimes in the aerosol composition of exoplanetary atmospheres: silicates dominate at atmospheric temperatures above 950 K, whereas hydrocarbons prevail for temperatures below 950 K. Aerosols are common in the atmospheres of exoplanets across a wide swath of temperatures, masses and ages(1-3). These aerosols strongly impact observations of transmitted, reflected and emitted light from exoplanets, obfuscating our understanding of exoplanet thermal structure and composition(4-6). Knowing the dominant aerosol composition would facilitate interpretations of exoplanet observations and theoretical understanding of their atmospheres. A variety of compositions have been proposed, including metal oxides and sulfides, iron, chromium, sulfur and hydrocarbons(7-11). However, the relative contributions of these species to exoplanet aerosol opacity is unknown. Here we show that the aerosol composition of giant exoplanets observed in transmission is dominated by silicates and hydrocarbons. By constraining an aerosol microphysics model with trends in giant exoplanet transmission spectra, we find that silicates dominate aerosol opacity above planetary equilibrium temperatures of 950 K due to low nucleation energy barriers and high elemental abundances, while hydrocarbon aerosols dominate below 950 K due to an increase in methane abundance. Our results are robust to variations in planet gravity and atmospheric metallicity within the range of most giant transiting exoplanets. We predict that spectral signatures of condensed silicates in the mid-infrared are most prominent for hot (>1,600 K), low-gravity (<10 m s(-2)) objects."
511,C,"In the local (redshift z approximate to 0) Universe, collisional ring galaxies make up only similar to 0.01% of galaxies(1) and are formed by head-on galactic collisions that trigger radially propagating density waves(2-4). These striking systems provide key snapshots for dissecting galactic disks and are studied extensively in the local Universe(5-9). However, not much is known about distant (z > 0.1) collisional rings(10-14). Here we present a detailed study of a ring galaxy at a look-back time of 10.8 Gyr (z = 2.19). Compared with our Milky Way, this galaxy has a similar stellar mass, but has a stellar half-light radius that is 1.5-2.2 times larger and is forming stars 50 times faster. The extended, diffuse stellar light outside the star-forming ring, combined with a radial velocity on the ring and an intruder galaxy nearby, provides evidence for this galaxy hosting a collisional ring. If the ring is secularly evolved(15,16), the implied large bar in a giant disk would be inconsistent with the current understanding of the earliest formation of barred spirals(17-21). Contrary to previous predictions(10-12), this work suggests that massive collisional rings were as rare 11 Gyr ago as they are today. Our discovery offers a unique pathway for studying density waves in young galaxies, as well as constraining the cosmic evolution of spiral disks and galaxy groups."
512,C,"Sunspots are intense collections of magnetic fields that pierce through the Sun's photosphere, with their signatures extending upwards into the outermost extremities of the solar corona(1). Cutting-edge observations and simulations are providing insights into the underlying wave generation(2), configuration(3,4) and damping(5) mechanisms found in sunspot atmospheres. However, the in situ amplification of magneto-hydrodynamic waves(6), rising from a few hundreds of metres per second in the photosphere to several kilometres per second in the chromosphere(7), has, until now, proved difficult to explain. Theory predicts that the enhanced umbral wave power found at chromospheric heights may come from the existence of an acoustic resonator(8-10), which is created due to the substantial temperature gradients experienced at photospheric and transition region heights(11). Here, we provide strong observational evidence of a resonance cavity existing above a highly magnetic sunspot. Through a combination of spectropolarimetric inversions and comparisons with high-resolution numerical simulations, we provide a new seismological approach to mapping the geometry of the inherent temperature stratifications across the diameter of the underlying sunspot, with the upper boundaries of the chromosphere ranging between 1,300 +/- 200 km and 2,300 +/- 250 km. Our findings will allow the three-dimensional structure of solar active regions to be conclusively determined from relatively commonplace two-dimensional Fourier power spectra. The techniques presented are also readily suitable for investigating temperature-dependent resonance effects in other areas of astrophysics, including the examination of Earth-ionosphere wave cavities(12)."
513,C,"Titan has an active methane-based hydrologic cycle(1) that has shaped a complex geologic landscape(2), making its surface one of most geologically diverse in the Solar System. Despite the differences in materials, temperatures and gravity fields between Earth and Titan, many of their surface features are similar and can be interpreted as products of the same geologic processes(3). However, Titan's thick and hazy atmosphere has hindered the identification of its geologic features at visible wavelengths and the study of its surface composition(4). Here we identify and map the major geological units on Titan's surface using radar and infrared data from the Cassini orbiter spacecraft. Correlations between datasets enabled us to produce a global map even where datasets were incomplete. The spatial and superposition relations between major geological units reveals the likely temporal evolution of the landscape and provides insight into the interacting processes driving its evolution. We extract the relative dating of the various geological units by observing their spatial superposition in order to get information on the temporal evolution of the landscape. The dunes and lakes are relatively young, whereas the hummocky or mountainous terrains are the oldest on Titan. Our results also show that Titan's surface is dominated by sedimentary or depositional processes with a clear latitudinal variation, with dunes at the equator, plains at mid-latitudes and labyrinth terrains and lakes at the poles."
514,C,"White dwarfs are the burnt-out cores of Sun-like stars and are the fate of 97 per cent of the stars in our Galaxy. The internal structure and composition of white dwarfs are hidden by their high gravities, which causes all elements apart from the lightest ones to settle out of their atmospheres. The most direct method of probing the inner structure of stars and white dwarfs in detail is via asteroseismology. Here we present a pulsating white dwarf in an eclipsing binary system, enabling us to place extremely precise constraints on the mass and radius of the white dwarf from the lightcurve, independent of the pulsations. This 0.325-solar-mass white dwarf-one member of the SDSS J115219.99+024814.4 system-will serve as a powerful benchmark with which to constrain empirically the core composition of low-mass stellar remnants and to investigate the effects of close binary evolution on the internal structure of white dwarfs."
515,C,"Isotopes of heavy elements are produced in various amounts by nuclear processes in stars(1,2). Consequently, the presence of isotopic anomalies in the Solar System is considered to reflect the presence of presolar grains condensed in previous generations of stars(3) and not a (proto-) Solar System process. However, for oxygen, the major rock-forming element, it has been shown that physico-chemical reactions applicable to the presolar cloud or the protoplanetary disk were a possible source of isotopic variations due to mass-independent isotopic fractionation (MIF)(4,5). Here we show that MIF effects are not restricted to oxygen, but can also be produced for titanium. Titanium-rich grains experimentally condensed from a TiCl4(g)/C5H12(g) plasma exhibit MIF effects from -25% to +120% for all Ti isotopic ratios. These large Ti isotopic variations follow the model developed for oxygen MIF6 and mimic the Ti isotopic anomalies observed in some presolar grains. This effect is ascribed to the reactions between chemically indistinguishable isotopes(6) and could contribute to the complexity of isotopic anomalies observed in Solar System materials(1,7-14)."
516,C,"Oxygen is the most common element after hydrogen and helium in Jupiter's atmosphere, and may have been the primary condensable (as water ice) in the protoplanetary disk. Prior to the Juno mission, in situ measurements of Jupiter's water abundance were obtained from the Galileo probe, which dropped into a meteorologically anomalous site. The findings of the Galileo probe were inconclusive because the concentration of water was still increasing when the probe ceased sending data. Here we report on the water abundance in the equatorial region (0 to 4 degrees north latitude), based on data taken at 1.25 to 22 GHz from the Juno microwave radiometer, probing pressures of approximately 0.7 to 30 bar. Because Juno discovered the deep atmosphere to be surprisingly variable as a function of latitude, it remains to confirm whether the equatorial abundance represents Jupiter's global water abundance. The water abundance at the equatorial region is inferred to be 2.5-1.6(-1.6)(+2.2)x10(3) ppm, or 2:7(-1.7)(+2.4) times the elemental ratio of protosolar oxygen to hydrogen (1 sigma uncertainties). If this reflects the global water abundance, the result suggests that the planetesimals that formed Jupiter were unlikely to have been water-rich clathrate hydrates."
517,C,"High-resolution observations of the third largest asteroid, (2) Pallas, from SPHERE unveil a heavily cratered surface, probably due to Pallas's inclined and eccentric orbit, a density almost equal to carbonaceous chondrites and hint at surficial salt-enriched spots. Asteroid (2) Pallas is the largest main-belt object not yet visited by a spacecraft, making its surface geology largely unknown and limiting our understanding of its origin and collisional evolution. Previous ground-based observational campaigns returned different estimates of its bulk density that are inconsistent with one another, one measurement(1) being compatible within error bars with the icy Ceres (2.16 +/- 0.01 g cm(-3))(2) and the other(3) compatible within error bars with the rocky Vesta (3.46 +/- 0.03 g cm(-3))(4). Here we report high-angular-resolution observations of Pallas performed with the extreme adaptive optics-fed SPHERE imager(5) on the Very Large Telescope. Pallas records a violent collisional history, with numerous craters larger than 30 km in diameter populating its surface and two large impact basins that could be related to a family-forming impact. Monte Carlo simulations of the collisional evolution of the main belt correlate this cratering record to the high average impact velocity of similar to 11.5 km s(-1) on Pallas-compared with an average of similar to 5.8 km s(-1) for the asteroid belt-induced by Pallas's high orbital inclination (i = 34.8 degrees) and orbital eccentricity (e = 0.23). Compositionally, Pallas's derived bulk density of 2.89 +/- 0.08 g cm(-3) (1 sigma uncertainty) is fully compatible with a CM chondrite-like body, as suggested by its spectral reflectance in the 3 mu m wavelength region(6). A bright spot observed on its surface may indicate an enrichment in salts during an early phase of aqueous alteration, compatible with Pallas's relatively high albedo of 12-17% (refs. (7,8)), although alternative origins are conceivable."
518,C,"Effective collecting area, angular resolution, field of view and energy response are fundamental attributes of X-ray telescopes. The performance of state-of-the-art telescopes is currently restricted by Wolter optics, especially for hard X-rays. Here we report the development of a stacked prism lens (SPL), which is lightweight and modular and has the potential for a significant improvement in effective area, while retaining high angular resolution. The proposed optics are built by stacking disks embedded with prismatic rings, created with photoresist by focused ultraviolet lithography. We demonstrate the SPL approach using a prototype lens that was manufactured and characterized at a synchrotron radiation facility. The design of a potential satellite-borne X-ray telescope is outlined and the performance is compared with contemporary missions."
519,C,"Cassiopeia A is a nearby young supernova remnant that provides a unique laboratory for the study of core-collapse supernova explosions(1). Cassiopeia A is known to be a type IIb supernova from the optical spectrum of its light echo(2), but the immediate progenitor of the supernova remains uncertain(3). Here, we report results of near-infrared, high-resolution spectroscopic observations of Cassiopeia A, where we detected the pristine circumstellar material of the supernova progenitor. Our observations revealed a strong emission line of iron (Fe) from a circumstellar clump that has not yet been processed by the supernova shock wave. A comprehensive analysis of the observed spectra, together with a Hubble Space Telescope image, indicates that the majority of Fe in this unprocessed circumstellar material is in the gas phase, not depleted onto dust grains as in the general interstellar medium(4). This result is consistent with a theoretical model(5,6) of dust condensation in material that is heavily enriched with carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycle nuclear reaction products, supporting the idea that the clump originated near the helium core of the progenitor(7,8). It has recently been found that type IIb supernovae can result from the explosion of a blue supergiant with a thin hydrogen envelope(9-11), and our results support such a scenario for Cassiopeia A. Keen observations of the Cassiopeia A supernova remnant have identified a circumstellar clump that lies outside the supernova shock front. This unprocessed material from the supernova progenitor contains iron in the gas phase, and is consistent with an origin within a blue supergiant star."
520,C,"A dust impact event detected by the ROSINA mass spectrometer towards the end of the Rosetta mission brings evidence of the presence of ammonium salts in comets. Ammonium salts can store enough nitrogen to explain the observed nitrogen depletion in comets and may have a role in amino acid formation. Cometary comae are generally depleted in nitrogen. The main carriers for volatile nitrogen in comets are NH3 and HCN. It is known that ammonia readily combines with many acids, such as HCN, HNCO and HCOOH, encountered in the interstellar medium as well as in cometary ice to form ammonium salts (NH4+X-) at low temperatures. Ammonium salts, which can have a substantial role in prebiotic chemistry, are hard to detect in space as they are unstable in the gas phase and their infrared signature is often hidden by thermal radiation or by, for example, OH in minerals. Here we report the presence of all possible sublimation products of five different ammonium salts in the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko measured by the ROSINA instrument onboard Rosetta. The relatively high sublimation temperatures of the salts leads to an apparent lack of volatile nitrogen in the coma. This then also explains the observed trend of higher NH3/H2O ratios with decreasing perihelion distances in comets."
521,E,"Libraries increasingly offer much of their collection online, rendering it invisible or unavailable to readers who, for reasons of information experience, prefer to browse the shelves. Although the evidence that shelf browsing is an important part of information behavior is increasing, information browsing as a behavior is somewhat of a black box (in contrast to web browsing, which is relatively well understood). It seems likely from early work that browsing is not, in fact, a monolithic behavior, but rather a set of behaviors and goals. The typologies presented in these works, however, are of a too high level to offer much insight into what support is needed for successful online browsing. In contrast, a recent spate of speculative browsing technologies meet some browsing needs, but offer little theoretical understanding of how systems support browsing. The major contribution of this article is a new typology of library browsing behavior based on recent observations of browsing behavior in libraries. The secondary contribution is an understanding of the interface features that would support these types of information browsers in an online environment."
522,E,"Digital archives are the preferred means for open access to research data. They play essential roles in knowledge infrastructures-robust networks of people, artifacts, and institutions-but little is known about how they mediate information exchange between stakeholders. We open the """"black box"""" of data archives by studying DANS, the Data Archiving and Networked Services institute of The Netherlands, which manages 50+ years of data from the social sciences, humanities, and other domains. Our interviews, weblogs, ethnography, and document analyses reveal that a few large contributors provide a steady flow of content, but most are academic researchers who submit data sets infrequently and often restrict access to their files. Consumers are a diverse group that overlaps minimally with contributors. Archivists devote about half their time to aiding contributors with curation processes and half to assisting consumers. Given the diversity and infrequency of usage, human assistance in curation and search remains essential. DANS' knowledge infrastructure encompasses public and private stakeholders who contribute, consume, harvest, and serve their data-many of whom did not exist at the time the DANS collections originated-reinforcing the need for continuous investment in digital data archives as their communities, technologies, and services evolve."
523,E,"The movement for open access publishing (OA) is often said to have its roots in the scientific disciplines, having been popularized by scientific publishers and formalized through a range of top-down policy interventions. But there is an often-neglected prehistory of OA that can be found in the early DIY publishers of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Managed entirely by working academics, these journals published research in the humanities and social sciences and stand out for their unique set of motivations and practices. This article explores this separate lineage in the history of the OA movement through a critical-theoretical analysis of the motivations and practices of the early scholar-led publishers. Alongside showing the involvement of the humanities and social sciences in the formation of OA, the analysis reveals the importance that these journals placed on experimental practices, critique of commercial publishing, and the desire to reach new audiences. Understood in today's context, this research is significant for adding complexity to the history of OA, which policymakers, advocates, and publishing scholars should keep in mind as OA goes mainstream."
524,E,"Virtual collaborations bring together people who must work together despite having varied access to and understanding of the work at hand. In many cases, the collaborations are technology supported, meaning that the work is done through shared documents. We develop a framework articulating the characteristics of documents supporting collaborators with access to asymmetric knowledge versus those with access to symmetric knowledge. Drawing on theories about document genre, boundary objects, and provenance, we hypothesize that documents supporting asymmetric collaborators are likely to articulate or prescribe their own (a) purpose, (b) context of use, (c) content and form, and (d) provenance in greater detail than documents supporting symmetric collaborators. We explore these hypotheses through content analysis of documents and instructions for documents from a variety of free/libre open-source projects (FLOSS). We present findings consistent with the hypotheses developed as well as results extending beyond our theory-derived assumptions. When participants have access to the same knowledge, the study suggests that prescriptions about the content of documents become less important compared with prescriptions about the context, provenance, and process of work. The study contributes with a dynamic perspective on communicative practices that consider an often-uneven distribution of knowledge in virtual collaborations."
525,E,"Research collaboration is promoted by governments and research funders, but if the relative prevalence and merits of collaboration vary internationally then different national and disciplinary strategies may be needed to promote it. This study compares the team size and field normalized citation impact of research across all 27 Scopus broad fields in the 10 countries with the most journal articles indexed in Scopus 2008-2012. The results show that team size varies substantially by discipline and country, with Japan (4.2) having two-thirds more authors per article than the United Kingdom (2.5). Solo authorship is rare in China (4%) but common in the United Kingdom (27%). While increasing team size associates with higher citation impact in almost all countries and fields, this association is much weaker in China than elsewhere. There are also field differences in the association between citation impact and collaboration. For example, larger team sizes in the Business, Management & Accounting category do not seem to associate with greater research impact, and for China and India, solo authorship associates with higher citation impact in this field. Overall, there are substantial international and field differences in the extent to which researchers collaborate and the extent to which collaboration associates with higher citation impact."
526,E,"The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between national culture and information source use (ISU) on a global level. A secondary analysis was carried out on three different data sets. They were (a) country-level data on ISU from World Values Survey (2005-2009); (b) country-specific mean scores of Hofstede's national culture dimensions (HNCD) of individualism (IDV), power distance (PDI), time orientation, uncertainty avoidance (UAI), masculinity (MAS), and indulgence (IVR); and (c) measures of wealth. The analysis showed the importance of three national culture dimensions of PDI (the way people of a nation interact with authorities), IDV (the degree of centrality of person or groups in a country), and IVR (the agreeableness of joy and happiness in a country) for explaining the cross-cultural differences of ISU. The findings were explained through HNCD, and four cultural patterns of ISU were identified. However, further research is required to better understand the complex relationships of cultural factors, ISU, and other societal variables."
527,E,"There is currently a paucity of evidence-based strategies that have been shown to increase citations of peer-reviewed articles following their publication. We conducted a 12-month randomized controlled trial to examine whether the promotion of article links in an online cross-publisher distribution platform (TrendMD) affects citations. In all, 3,200 articles published in 64 peer-reviewed journals across eight subject areas were block randomized at the subject level to either the TrendMD group (n = 1,600) or the control group (n = 1,600) of the study. Our primary outcome compares the mean citations of articles randomized to TrendMD versus control after 12 months. Articles randomized to TrendMD showed a 50% increase in mean citations relative to control at 12 months. The difference in mean citations at 12 months for articles randomized to TrendMD versus control was 5.06, 95% confidence interval [2.87, 7.25], was statistically significant (p < .001) and found in three of eight subject areas. At 6 months following publication, articles randomized to TrendMD showed a smaller, yet statistically significant (p = .005), 21% increase in mean citations, relative to control. To our knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled trial to demonstrate how an intervention can be used to increase citations of peer-reviewed articles after they have been published."
528,E,"This article examines how search engines and social-networking sites enable and constrain the identity-related information practices of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) millennials in the United States. I employ affordances as a process concept to understand the recursive relationship between individuals and technologies and envision information practices as an outcome of this relationship. Guided by this conceptual framework, I conducted 30 semistructured interviews with LGBTQ+ individuals between the ages of 18 and 38. Data analysis identified 3 key affordances that enable and constrain participants' information practices: visibility, anonymity, and association. The findings indicate that participants are highly skilled in appropriating technological features to engage in desired information practices, such as seeking and creating. However, they also must contend with significant sociocultural barriers encoded into these features, which reinforce hetero- and cisnormative identity discourses. Library practitioners and systems designers can use these findings to offer services and systems inclusive of LGBTQ+ populations."
529,E,"This study investigated the stability of Twitter counts of scientific publications over time. For this, we conducted an analysis of the availability statuses of over 2.6 million Twitter mentions received by the 1,154 most tweeted scientific publications recorded by up to October 2017. The results show that of the Twitter mentions for these highly tweeted publications, about 14.3% had become unavailable by April 2019. Deletion of tweets by users is the main reason for unavailability, followed by suspension and protection of Twitter user accounts. This study proposes two measures for describing the Twitter dissemination structures of publications: Degree of Originality (i.e., the proportion of original tweets received by an article) and Degree of Concentration (i.e., the degree to which retweets concentrate on a single original tweet). Twitter metrics of publications with relatively low Degree of Originality and relatively high Degree of Concentration were observed to be at greater risk of becoming unstable due to the potential disappearance of their Twitter mentions. In light of these results, we emphasize the importance of paying attention to the potential risk of unstable Twitter counts, and the significance of identifying the different Twitter dissemination structures when studying the Twitter metrics of scientific publications."
530,E,"Media platforms, technological systems, and search engines act as conduits and gatekeepers for all kinds of information. They often influence, reflect, and reinforce gender stereotypes, including those that represent occupations. This study examines the prevalence of gender stereotypes on digital media platforms and considers how human efforts to create and curate messages directly may impact these stereotypes. While gender stereotyping in social media and algorithms has received some examination in the recent literature, its prevalence in different types of platforms (for example, wiki vs. news vs. social network) and under differing conditions (for example, degrees of human- and machine-led content creation and curation) has yet to be studied. This research explores the extent to which stereotypes of certain strongly gendered professions (librarian, nurse, computer programmer, civil engineer) persist and may vary across digital platforms (Twitter, the New York Times online, Wikipedia, and Shutterstock). The results suggest that gender stereotypes are most likely to be challenged when human beings act directly to create and curate content in digital platforms, and that highly algorithmic approaches for curation showed little inclination towards breaking stereotypes. Implications for the more inclusive design and use of digital media platforms, particularly with regard to mediated occupational messaging, are discussed."
531,E,"We investigate the state of multilingualism across the social sciences and humanities (SSH) using a comprehensive data set of research outputs from seven European countries (Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Flanders [Belgium], Norway, Poland, and Slovenia). Although English tends to be the dominant language of science, SSH researchers often produce culturally and societally relevant work in their local languages. We collected and analyzed a set of 164,218 peer-reviewed journal articles (produced by 51,063 researchers from 2013 to 2015) and found that multilingualism is prevalent despite geographical location and field. Among the researchers who published at least three journal articles during this time period, over one-third from the various countries had written their work in at least two languages. The highest share of researchers who published in only one language were from Flanders (80.9%), whereas the lowest shares were from Slovenia (57.2%) and Poland (59.3%). Our findings show that multilingual publishing is an ongoing practice in many SSH research fields regardless of geographical location, political situation, and/or historical heritage. Here we argue that research is international, but multilingual publishing keeps locally relevant research alive with the added potential for creating impact."
532,E,"The data paper, an emerging scholarly genre, describes research data sets and is intended to bridge the gap between the publication of research data and scientific articles. Research examining how data papers report data events, such as data transactions and manipulations, is limited. The research reported on in this article addresses this limitation and investigated how data events are inscribed in data papers. A content analysis was conducted examining the full texts of 82 data papers, drawn from the curated list of data papers connected to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. Data events recorded for each paper were organized into a set of 17 categories. Many of these categories are described together in the same sentence, which indicates the messiness of data events in the laboratory space. The findings challenge the degrees to which data papers are a distinct genre compared to research articles and they describe data-centric research processes in a through way. This article also discusses how our results could inform a better data publication ecosystem in the future."
533,E,"This study investigates the influence of individual and information characteristics on university students' information channel selection (that is, search engines, social question & answer sites, online health websites, and social networking sites) of online health information (OHI) for three different types of search tasks (factual, exploratory, and personal experience). Quantitative data were collected via an online questionnaire distributed to students on various postgraduate programs at a large UK university. In total, 291 responses were processed for descriptive statistics, Principal Component Analysis, and Poisson regression. Search engines are the most frequently used among the four channels of information discussed in this study. Credibility, ease of use, style, usefulness, and recommendation are the key factors influencing users' judgments of information characteristics (explaining over 62% of the variance). Poisson regression indicated that individuals' channel experience, age, student status, health status, and triangulation (comparing sources) as well as style, credibility, usefulness, and recommendation are substantive predictors for channel selection of OHI."
534,E,"Efforts to combat continuing gender inequalities in academia need to be informed by evidence about where differences occur. Citations are relevant as potential evidence in appointment and promotion decisions, but it is unclear whether there have been historical gender differences in average citation impact that might explain the current shortfall of senior female academics. This study investigates the evolution of gender differences in citation impact 1996-2018 for six million articles from seven large English-speaking nations: Australia, Canada, Ireland, Jamaica, New Zealand, UK, and the USA. The results show that a small female citation advantage has been the norm over time for all these countries except the USA, where there has been no practical difference. The female citation advantage is largest, and statistically significant in most years, for Australia and the UK. This suggests that any academic bias against citing female-authored research cannot explain current employment inequalities. Nevertheless, comparisons using recent citation data, or avoiding it altogether, during appointments or promotion may disadvantage females in some countries by underestimating the likely greater impact of their work, especially in the long term."
535,E,"University libraries are partnering with disciplinary data producers to provide long-term digital curation of research data sets. Managing data set producer expectations and guiding future development of library services requires understanding the decisions libraries make about curatorial activities, why they make these decisions, and the effects on future data reuse. We present a study, comprising interviews (n = 43) and ethnographic observation, of two university libraries who partnered with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) collaboration to curate a significant astronomy data set. The two libraries made different choices of the materials to curate and associated services, which resulted in different reuse possibilities. Each of the libraries offered partial solutions to the SDSS leaders' objectives. The libraries' approaches to curation diverged due to contextual factors, notably the extant infrastructure at their disposal (including technical infrastructure, staff expertise, values and internal culture, and organizational structure). The Data Transfer Process case offers lessons in understanding how libraries choose curation paths and how these choices influence possibilities for data reuse. Outcomes may not match data producers' initial expectations but may create opportunities for reusing data in unexpected and beneficial ways."
536,E,"Recommender systems may accelerate knowledge discovery in many fields. However, their users may be competitors guarding their ideas before publication or for other reasons. We describe a simulation experiment to assess user privacy against targeted attacks, modeling recommendations based on co-access data. The analysis uses an unusually long (14 years) set of anonymized historical data on user-item accesses. We introduce the notions of """"visibility"""" and """"discoverability."""" We find, based on historical data, that the majority of the actions of arXiv users would be potentially """"visible"""" under targeted attack. However, """"discoverability,"""" which incorporates the difficulty of actually seeing a """"visible"""" effect, is very much lower for nearly all users. We consider the effect of changes to the settings of the recommender algorithm on the visibility and discoverability of user actions and propose mitigation strategies that reduce both measures of risk."
537,E,"This article considers the problem of preserving research software within the wider realm of digital curation, academic research libraries, and the scholarly record. We conducted a pilot study to understand the ecosystem in which research software participates, and to identify significant characteristics that have high potential to support future scholarly practices. A set of topical curation dimensions were derived from the extant literature and applied to select cases of institutionally significant research software. This approach yields our main contribution, a curation model and decision framework for preserving research software as a scholarly object. The results of our study highlight the unique characteristics and challenges at play in building curation services in academic research libraries."
538,F,"The main objective of the paper is to identify and explore patterns and dynamics of transatlantic scientific collaboration in the field of strategic management between the United States (US) and European countries (EUC) during the last quarter century. Scholarly connections between countries, cities and institutions on the basis of co-author affiliations were analysed to determine the knowledge flow from a geographical perspective. This is the first time international scientific collaboration between researchers in the field of strategic management has been studied to such an extent. We employed all sources of relevant data from the Web of Science and Scopus databases and explored 453 results. Utilizing a bibliometric analysis, our study offers a comprehensive and up-to-dale identification and assessment of the current situation and dynamics of transatlantic scientific collaboration. The obtained results confirm the dominant role of the US in this type of collaboration. Also, the dominant role of several clusters in terms of collaboration, both on country and institution levels can also be observed. The study confirms the weaker position of Eastern and Central Europe countries in this collaboration and provides some recommendations to increase this type of knowledge exchange in the future."
539,F,"The paper explores how business continuity management (BCM) is defined within the professional and academic communities that work in the field or research it. It sets out the framework for the composing elements of a BCM that emerge and considers how these various elements can interact with each other to build a sound business continuity management. Also, the paper aims to examine the organization's critical functions that ensure an effective BCM. The research relies on a questionnaire-based survey, with data collected by personally interviewing top and middle-level managers from Romanian small and medium-sized companies. The results, which count on the responses of 119 participant companies, show that risk assessment takes a critical role in building the organization's BCM strategy, while business continuity response planning has the strongest impact on the overall effectiveness of the organization's BCM. The novelty of this research lies in a first time establishment of the critical functions that are vital for companies to maintain their essential business operations in case of disruptive incidents, to build organizational resilience. Future research should be grounded on testing if the BCM arrangements and business impact analysis influence the BCM strategy as the existing data did not prove that it did."
540,F,"Export activities have become crucial to firms' competitiveness, with determinants of export performance being a challenging field of research, since there is no consensus regarding the explained and explanatory variables or on the econometric methods to be used. Using a panel data of Portuguese wine firms, this paper aims to contribute to this debate, combining both resource- and institutional-based views of the firm. This paper tries to overcome the methodological hurdle, addressing sample selection issues and considering the fractional response nature of export performance. Given the pros and cons of each econometric approach, the Heckman selection model, the fractional probit model and the two-part fractional response model are estimated, and the results compared. From a public policy perspective, the results show that policies that promote wine firm size, labor productivity and wine promotion in third countries have a positive impact on export performance at firm-level. Age does not appear as a key factor on the internationalization of Portuguese wine firms."
541,F,"Recognizing the state of the universities and disrupting their functions by performance evaluation helps them adopt more appropriate educational, research and institutional policies to conduct a university system. In this paper, the importance of the services provided and the activities of the university are determined by means of the balanced scorecard (BSC) approach, and the performance assessment structure is implemented based on an integrated fuzzy multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approach. For this purpose, interdependencies between BSC aspects and effective indicators weight are determined by Fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (FDEMATEL) and Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (FANP) methods, respectively. Accordingly, the final weight of the effective indexes on the performance evaluation of university is presented and the educational income is recognized as one of the most important indicators. Finally, the priorities of universities are specified in order to improve the performance and policy making by the importance-performance analysis (IPA). 'Therefore, the growth of the number of students should be considered as one of the most important stages in improving university performance in the future in order to achieve educational income. Moreover, the guidelines for universities and higher education institutions are presented to identity key factors in implementing and improving performance."
542,F,"The purpose of this article is to provide a robust and consistent cross-country measurement of the smart-shopper self-concept. Drawing on existing single-country studies, our work extends research by validating a pioneer cross-country scale that measures the smart-shopping mechanism in a holistic manner. Survey data were collected from 1,233 shoppers from six different Western countries. Cross-country equivalence was assessed using multigroup confirmatory factor analysis using configural, metric, and factor variance invariance tests. The results indicate that the smart-shopper self-concept is a second-order construct comprising two dimensions: smart shopper-attributed behavior and smart-shopper feelings. Our findings also reveal that consumers in the different countries exhibit different degrees of smart-shopper self-concept and differ in their perceptions of the affective and behavioral responses generated during a smart purchase process. Marketing practitioners looking to target smart shoppers across multiple countries cordd build on the findings of this study to develop effective international segmentation and positioning strategies."
543,F,"The objective of this paper is to test whether the complete pass-through of exchange rate exists when there are almost no transaction costs and in the environment of competitive market. In general, the literature claims that the pass-through of exchange rate is incomplete due to imperfect market, i.e. the presence of transaction costs and imperfect competition. The quasi-experimental case of the food import to Hong Kong from Mainland China is considered in the analysis. The results show that the pass-through of the exchange rate of Chinese RMB against to US dollar to Hong Kong's food import price is complete in long-run equilibrium. Besides, the short-run adjustment significantly contributes to correcting the deviation from the long-run pass-through effect. Moreover, the complete pass-through still exists after accounting for the effects of asymmetry and volatility. Therefore, this paper contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence that the complete pass-through of exchange rate can exist in the real world."
544,F,"The aim of this paper is to propose a management model which would assess the state of the business and indicate the improvement points, as well as to demonstrate the applicability of the model in a case of the postal company. An A'BA model is proposed which represents a combined application of Analytic Hierarchy Process - AHP method as a multi-criteria decision making tool and theory of business areas. The research consists of two parts. To define the most important influencing factor on business performance, the experts are interviewed. A new concept is proposed and applied in the process of aggregating experts' assessments based on their mapping in a plane. This creates the appropriate surface, and the position of its centroid in relation to the Saaty's scale defines the final score of pairwise comparison - an indicator of the relationship between two elements that are compared. In the second part, additional experts from the determined area are involved to define an approach for detailed analysis of the most important factor. In this case, the approach included a survey of employees based on the specialized questionnaire. The guidelines for business performance improvement are obtained."
545,F,"The article presents the results of an analysis comparing changes in the competitive positions of the Baltic States in comparison with the. Visegrad Group countries and the new EU Member States in the post accessionperiod (2006-2017). This type of study has not been presented in more detail in the available literature. Researchers of international economic competitiveness mostly focussed on the EU-15. The Baltic States mainly have been excluded from such investigations. Therefore, the article may significantly contribute to bridging the gap. The study employs the method of secondary data's comparative analysis concerning indices and pillars of economic competitiveness described in The Global Competitiveness Reports of the World Economic Forum. An important element of the examination was to identify major determinants of those developments. It focussed on the identification of structural factors shaping the competitive positions of the countries covered. The demonstration which of the factors determine competitiveness and the assessment of long-term changes may serve as the basis for economic policy making. The assumption is that the EU accession had a considerable impact on the development of the competitive position but specific effects varied between countries. The Baltic States differed rather widely regarding the improvement of their competitive positions throughout the post-accession period."
546,F,"This paper investigates the ability of gold to hedge worldwide risks from the perspective of global economic policy uncertainty (GEPU). By applying the full- and sub-sample rolling-window bootstrap causality tests to analyze the dynamic interaction between GEPU and gold price (GP). It can be observed that gold can effectively hedge risks of GEPU during the Asian financial crisis, dot-com bubble and global economic crisis, but this result does not hold in non-crisis period. GEPU manifests two-way impacts on the GP in a few periods, this relationship between GEPU and GP being consistent with the hypothesis in the general equilibrium model, which states that changes in GEPU lead to the fluctuations of GP. In turn, GP has both positive and negative impacts on GEPU. In the current complex economic situation, governments and investors can consider gold to hedge risks of GEPU, especially during the economic crises."
547,F,"The phenomenon of enterprises bankruptcy is an extremely complex process of economic, legal, social and even psychological nature. In the developed countries, the first studies on forecasting bankruptcy date to the early 20th century. In Central and Eastern Europe, due to, among other factors, the geopolitical situation and the introduced economic system, this issue became the subject of researchers' interest only in the 1990s. The universality and complexity of the phenomenon incline the Authors to make an attempt to identify the scale of the bankruptcy processes in the states of the Visegrad Group (V4). The countries of V4 were selected because of their common history and similar economic development. The aim of this article is to analyze the dynamics of the phenomenon of bankruptcy of enterprises in the states of the V4 Group in the years 2005-2016 on the basis of the data taken from the Credit reform reports. The estimation of trend models in time series on the basis of the bankruptcy in the Visegrad Group countries in the years 2005-2016 was used in the article as the primary research method. The descriptive analysis was also applied in the article."
548,F,"This paper investigates the effect of derivatives on the relationship between the foreign exchange rate and the stock market. A theoretical model is used to extend the understanding of that relationship. Also, the model is tested with an empirical analysis using the GMM strategy for the Mexican and Brazilian stock markets for the period 2007 to 2019. Findings reveal that in addition to the spot exchange rate, exchange rate futures explain the currency exposure, wherein the derivative effect is the most prominent. The result implies that both risk sources should be considered in the implementation of risk management or macroeconomic policy. The theoretical results are extended by applying them to international portfolio management, proposing a strategy to mitigate foreign exchange exposure with derivatives. This study contributes to the literature by explaining why the minimum variance hedge ratio plays an essential role in the foreign exchange rate and stock market nexus."
549,F,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the reaction of the insolvency rate to the various shocks in the economies of Romania and Spain through a Structural Vector Autoregressive model. Departing from quarterly data for 2008-2016, it was found that the future values of the insolvency rate are explained by the past values of the interest rate and the retail trade index, more precisely macroeconomic risk factors cost of debt and changing in demand are main responsible for the health of non-financial corporations sector. In contrast, the influence of the investment rate on insolvency rate is not predictable. In addition, both in Romania and in Spain the interest rate is the main determinant of the insolvency rate variation, beyond its own innovations, in horizons of over 2 quarters. These results were obtained under the circumstances that the analysed period was characterized by the Great Recession and its recovery. In this situation, firms faced a lesser demand as well as a tightening on the possibilities of obtaining the external funds they needed, not only to finance their expansion projects but even their daily operations. Consequently, many firms faced a negative environment that forced them to go out of the market."
550,F,"The main objective of the paper is to address the question of how to foster innovation and small firm growth under different levels of technological turbulence. Specifically, the paper examines the relationship among risk-taking, arising from different levels of technological turbulence, flow experience, innovation and small firm growth (i.e. market share and ROI growth). The underlying premise of our research is that there are substantial differences in low and high technological environments in terms of the relationships of risk taking, flow at work, innovation and small firm growth. Based on a survey among 188 entrepreneurs, the paper tests the proposed relationships in technological diverse environments with structural equation modelling. The results show that, when the level of technological turbulence is high, flow experience is significantly related to innovation and small firm growth, while in low-technological turbulence environment such relationships are not present. The study contributes to the entrepreneurial literature by demonstrating that in highly turbulent environments, flow experience may promote entrepreneurs' innovation and the efficiency of small firm performance. The study also provides new empirical insights about the relationship between entrepreneurs' behaviour, which is influenced by environmental conditions, on the one hand and innovation and small firm growth on the other hand."
551,F,"This paper investigates how the process of going bankrupt can be recognized much earlier by enterprises than by traditional forecasting models. The presented studies focus on the assessment of credit risk classes and on determination of the differences in risk class migrations between non-bankrupt enterprises and future insolvent firms. For this purpose, the author has developed a model of a Kohonen artificial neural network to determine six different classes of risk. Long-term analysis horizon of 15 years before the enterprises went bankrupt was conducted. This long forecasting horizon allows one to identify, visualize and compare the intensity and pattern of changes in risk classes during the 15-year trajectory of development between two separate groups of companies (150 bankrupt and 150 non-bankrupt firms). The effectiveness of the forecast of the developed model was compared to three popular statistical models that predict the financial failure of companies. These studies represent one of the first attempts in the literature to identify the long-term behavioral pattern difkrences between future """"good"""" and """"bad"""" enterprises from the perspective of risk class migrations."
552,F,"The subject-related literature provided information about the skills, education, and formal competencies required to join teams working on the innovation process. According to findings presented in this article, the previous studies have investigated insufficiently the gender-related issues in the decisions of managers who involve specialists in the innovation process. Thus, the purpose of this research was to identify, examine, and describe differences in the participation of men and women in the innovation process, considering their personal characteristics, attitudes, and behaviours. The research covered 1,164 innovative companies - beneficiaries of the European Union Cohesion Policy of 2007-2013. The survey was distributed independently to women and men participating in innovative activities in the researched companies. Two independent responses were received from each company; thus, two independent data samples were created. Both data composition and preliminary analysis adhere to the requirements of Principal Component Analysis. The results allow for the new design proposal to increase the effectiveness of teams working on innovation-focused tasks. In addition to education and experience, managers can now consider personal characteristics and better select women and men to drive innovation."
553,F,"The aim of this paper is to examine the relationship between supply network position and firm performance. A-share manufacturing companies listed from 2013 to 2015 are chosen as the initial samples, and large sample supply networks are constructed with relational embeddedness and structural embeddedness. The location of supply network is depicted by network centrality and structural hole with social network analysis, and the influence of supply network position on the corporate performance is examined with multiple OLS regression analysis. This paper observes that a firms' supply network position is an important factor affecting its performance. The higher the network centrality is, the richer the structural holes are, and the worse the company's performance is. The results suggest that firms that have a high level of centrality or rich structural holes in their supply networks will gain limited information, resource and control benefits and face great business risks that may negatively influence their performance."
554,F,"Asset allocation is a critical concern for any investor in the financial market. This paper aims to prioritize five randomly selected firms from the top ten stocks by market capitalization of the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) by opting for adequate financial procedures and practical criteria under uncertain conditions. Decision makers want not only the ranking order of stocks but also capital proportions to be allocated. Therefore, this study uses a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach comprising of an integrated analytic network process (ANP) and decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) in a grey environment for optimal portfolio selection to provide both ranking and weighting information for decision makers. Results indicate that return, financial ratios, dividends, and risk are causal criteria group, which are the most influential determinants for obtaining high benefits with regards to stock portfolio selection in SSE. The free float of stocks is the least influencing criterion among all identified criteria of stock portfolio selection of SSE. The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd. stocks have the highest allocated proportion with the highest priority shown by investors and can be described as a suitable alternative. The practical implications of this research are that the approach, when applied, highlights how the grey system theory minimizes the uncertainties in all stages of decision-making of portfolio selection."
555,F,"The aim of this paper is to define the significance of different indicators that affect the expected benefit of customers when using loyalty cards in the purchasing process in the retail sector. As the most important indicators that affect expectations while using loyalty cards, the following was tested: price discounts, more efficient service and rewards, personalized communication, payment option, better information, status symbols and additional benefits. The research was conducted on a sample of 552 holders of loyalty cards of the largest retail chains in selected Central Europe (CE) and South East Europe (SEE) countries. The values of indicators for different categories of customers and different markets can be determined based on the obtained results and conducted tests. The determined values of the indicators are the basis for the formation of a regression model that will serve the chain managers to optimize the loyalty programs in relation to the identified customer expectations."
556,F,"Although integration and collaboration are considered critical factors in supply chain practice, improving integration and collaboration still encounters a dilemma that is ascribable to three problems, i.e., partners' opportunistic behaviours, the complicated resource distribution and heavy workloads, and large time costs. To solve these problems and effectively improve integration and collaboration, a revised taxonomic approach will be developed in this research. Based on the case of East Asia, the revised taxonomic approach can produce guidelines to help manufacturers well know how to effectively improve integration and collaboration in a sequential manner and avoid encountering the three problems noted above. There are multiple implications of this study; the research results not only develop a new approach by revising theory but also provide convenient tools to help manufacturers effectively improve integration and collaboration when entering different markets. Thus, this study makes great contributions to the field."
557,F,"Following China's """"One Belt One Road"""" global economic expansion strategy, Chinese small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) along with state-owned, large corporations are increasingly seeking business opportunities internationally. Little is known about the process of small firms' international opportunity creation and discovery in this particular context. This study examines the role of Chinese SME managers' global mindset in driving their international opportunity identification through two key activities in their internationalization process: international knowledge based and networking activities. Data were collected from a survey of 191 small and medium-sized enterprises in China. The results of structural equation modelling show that Chinese SME managers' global mindset has a positive effect on both international networking and knowledge acquisition activities, which in turn have positive effects on the development of international opportunities. The findings suggest that SMEs, while going through the internationalization process, rely extensively on social interaction with foreign business partners to obtain knowledge of the customers and institutions in the foreign market."
558,F,"This paper investigates the differential effects of corporate social responsibility (CSR) dimensions on corporate financial performance (CFP) across sectors in China. This research uses a unique data set provided by China Stock Market and Accounting Research (CSMAR), showing expenditure on CSR programs from 568 Chinese publicly traded firm-year observations from 2008 to 2017. Compared to previous studies using scores produced by extra-financial rating agencies, this research quantifies CSR efforts by corporate expenditure on CSR practices, which offers quantitative and precise information in explaining the CSR-CFP link. The results show that the dimension of the environment has negative effects on financial performance in capital-intensive manufacturing industries. The impact of HR expenditure on CFP is negative in the tertiary sector and resource-intensive manufacturing industries. However, CSR investments in the community are positively related to financial performance in resource-intensive industries and other secondary sector (mining, construction, and utilities). Firms, in general, could gain benefits when spending more on business and financial stakeholders."
559,G,"Objective: The aim of the study was to assess the effects of the maternal and child health (MCH) system strengthening through multilevel governmental collaboration in Nujiang Prefecture, China. Study design: A case study design was applied. Methods: Guided by the logical framework of the Nujiang MCH Comprehensive Intervention Project, national, provincial, and prefecture government sectors jointly implemented comprehensive health system strengthening (HSS) interventions in Nujiang Prefecture. In this case study, we conducted the end point surveys (November 2015 and January 2016) with 33 local MCH facilities. We also interviewed 35 MCH providers, government officials, leaders of MCH facilities, and project specialists. The thematic framework method was used to analyze the interview data, and descriptive analysis was performed to analyze the survey data. Results: The three levels of governmental collaboration contributed to increased government investment in the local MCH system and ensured the successful implementation of the project. Participatory training methods and appropriate HSS interventions tailored to the local context were crucial to improve MCH providers' knowledge and skills, with the proportion of qualified MCH providers increasing from 70% in 2011 to 96% in 2015. Owing to this increase in knowledge and the increase in needed equipment, more MCH hospitals could provide inpatient obstetric services, and more town health clinics were capable of providing basic MCH services. The development of a reimbursement policy tailored to the local context promoted in-hospital delivery. At the conclusion of the project, percentages of antenatal care, in-hospital delivery, and newborn screening increased by 20.71%, 18.12%, and 278.62%, respectively. Growth monitoring coverage for children younger than three years remained stable at around 90%. However, the MCH system was negatively impacted by the workforce shortage. Those shortages were caused by a lack of positive recruitment and retention and incentive policies. Conclusions: Implementation of comprehensive HSS interventions through multilevel governmental collaboration improves the MCH system in remote and low-income areas. (C) 2019 The Authors.

The objectives of this study were to examine the trends in intersection density in the US from 2007 to 2011 and assess the associations between intersection density and childhood obesity risk at the state level. Study design: Longitudinal analyses were conducted to assess the spatial-temporal changes of population-weighted intersection density in relation to the risk of childhood obesity in the US. Methods: Road network data from the Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER) (2007-2011), the prevalence of overweight and obesity data from the National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) (2007-2011), and the American Community Survey (ACS) (2011) were used. Geographic information system (GIS) visualization and spatial and regression analyses were conducted. Mixed-effect models were fit to assess the longitudinal relationship between intersection density and childhood obesity. Results: Between 2007 and 2011, population-weighted intersection density remained relatively stable in most states. Low-intersection-density states were clustered in the Southeastern region in both 2007 and 2011. The high-intersection-density states were clustered in the Middle Atlantic Division. California and Nevada also were identified as high-intersection-density clusters in 2011. States with lower road intersection density corresponded with states with higher childhood obesity prevalence. Our mixed-effect model estimates suggested that increased intersection density was associated with decreased obesity prevalence. Conclusions: This study provided empirical evidence for longitudinal associations between neighborhood intersection density and childhood obesity prevalence based on national data and offered a new perspective of the role that road network plays in childhood obesity prevention.

561,G,"Objectives: The aim of the study was to assess the impact of a recreation access pass on grade 5 children's physical activity (PA) levels. Study design: This is a pre-post evaluation of a population-level community-based intervention. Methods: All grade 5 students in (London, Ontario, Canada) were invited to participate in the [ACT-i-Pass] program (G5AP) in May 2014. A total of 643 children completed surveys, that included Physical Activity Questionnaire for Children (PAQ-C), at baseline (October 2014) and 6-month follow-up (April 2015). Difference in the means t-test compared PAQ-C scores between baseline and follow-up for the sample and subgroups. Multiple regression analysis tested associations between change in PAQ-C scores and intrapersonal-, interpersonal-, and physical environment-level variables. Results: PA increased significantly from baseline to 6-month follow-up. Girls, visible minorities, immigrants, and children with low parental support experienced significant increases in PA. Regression found girls benefitted from the G5AP significantly more than boys, and lower parental support is related to increases in PA. Conclusion: The findings indicate that collaboratively developed, community-based interventions can significantly increase children's PA levels, particularly among subgroups with traditionally lower PA. The pre-post evaluation of this community-based intervention provides useful evidence for developing policies and programs aimed at making population-level improvements in children's PA levels.

562,G,"Objectives: The purpose of this study was to analyse associations between sexual orientation and poor psychological health. Study design: This was a cross-sectional study. Methods: The 2012 public health survey in Scania, Southern Sweden, is a cross-sectional population-based study with 28,029 participants aged 18-80 years. Logistic regression analyses were performed. Results: The prevalence of poor psychological health (measured using the General Health Questionnaire [GHQ]-12) was 16.3% among men and 22.4% among women. Bisexual men and women had significantly higher odds ratios of poor psychological health throughout the multiple analyses than heterosexual individuals. In contrast, the odds ratios of poor psychological health among gay men and lesbian women were not significantly higher. Conclusions: Respondents with bisexual orientation have increased risk of poor psychological health. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Royal Society for Public Health."
563,G,"Objectives: Expansion of newborn bloodspot screening (NBS) within England, which practices an informed consent model, justified examining acceptability and effectiveness of alternative consent models. Study design: Qualitative focus groups. Methods: Forty-five parents and 37 screening professionals (SPs) participated. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Parents and SPs initially appeared to have differing views about appropriate consent models. Most parents accepted assumed consent, if adequately informed; however, once aware of bloodspot storage, informed consent was wanted. SPs valued informed consent, but acknowledged it was difficult to obtain. Both samples wanted parents to be informed but were unclear how this could be achieved. Most parents felt NBS was not presented as optional. Conclusion: The simultaneous exploration of parents and SPs views, in real time is original. This rigour avoided the reliance on retrospective accounts which make it difficult to establish how decisions were made at the time. It is also unique in providing pre-interview consent models to drive the depth of data. It was rigorous in member checking. Findings suggested a preference for full disclosure of all information with some parents valuing this more than choice. Both samples queried whether current consent was sufficiently informed and voluntary. Results suggest differing tolerances of consent type if screening is solely for diagnostic purposes vs bloodspot storage. Results highlight the need for caution when examining consent model preferences without also checking knowledge, as opinions may be based on incomplete knowledge. Future research is needed to examine efficacy of proposed changes. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Royal Society for Public Health."
564,G,"Objectives: The objective of this study was to evaluate health outcomes for workers subject to piece rate historically to better understand the implications of pay type in the modern-day gig economy. While piece rate occurring in the 1980s and 1990s predates recent platform-based employment, it introduced and normalized patterns of economic precariousness that are instrumental in the current gig economy. Evidence suggests that such pay types may result in poor health outcomes; however, cross-sector evidence of its long-term effects on US workers is lacking. This article represents the first longitudinal cross-sector analysis relating health outcomes to this performance pay type in US workers. Study design: This is a longitudinal cohort study. Methods: Data from six survey waves of the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth collected between 1988 and 2000 are used in a random-effects logit model to predict self-reported health limitations related to piece rate, while controlling for worker, work environment, lifestyle, time, and location trends. Results: Pay tied to piece rate in current or prior periods significantly increases the odds of self-reported health limitations compared with salaried work (odds ratio [OR]: 1.4-1.8). These effects are elevated for the subgroups of low-wage (OR: 1.5-1.8), female (OR: 1.8-1.9), and non-white (OR: 2.0-2.1) workers compared with their high-wage, male, and white peers. Conclusions: The results suggest that piece rate pay designed to promote efficiency may have important negative implications for worker health, especially for the most vulnerable members of the US workforce such as women, minority, and low-income workers. Given the growing popularity of performance-based pay to the gig economy, more research is needed to determine if the practice is justified from a public health perspective. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

565,G,"Objectives: The political controversy surrounding firearm fatalities in US youths (aged 15-24 years) continues. This study examines whether a public health approach could reduce gun-related deaths in the US. Methods: Based on the latest World Health Organization (WHO) data, current (2015) numbers and rates per million of US civilian violent deaths (CVDs) (including transport deaths, suicides and homicides) for both the general population and youths (aged 15-24 years) are examined. US CVD results are considered in a wider context by comparing the results with those of seven other major Western countries (MWCs). To demonstrate the effectiveness of a public health policy, transport deaths between 1979 and 2015 are analysed, which corresponds to a time period when government interventions based on technical improvements and behaviour change were implemented to improve road safety. The statistical significance of the comparison between road fatalities and suicide rates between 1979 and 2015 is determined by the chi-squared test. Results: In 2015, the total number of US CVDs was 101,456, consisting of 44,193 suicides and 17,588 homicides (of which 30,891 were likely to be gun-related deaths). Youth deaths totalled 17,432; 5491 suicides and 4732 homicides, including approximately 5112 gun-related deaths. US CVDs are substantially higher than the other MWCs for both the general population and youths. In 1979, US transport deaths were 57,577, which decreased to 39,675 in 2015. Every country's public health approach to reduce road deaths, when compared with suicides, was highly statistically significant. Conclusions: Government interventions have reduced transport deaths; thus, new policies may also reduce gun-related violence. The evidence points towards a public health approach, such as that used to reduce road deaths, which could help reduce US firearm-related deaths to levels comparable with other MWCs.

566,G,"Objectives: The aim of the Scottish AHP LifeCurve (TM) survey was to gather a snapshot of where people are on their LifeCurve (TM) when receiving allied health professions (AHP) services and to understand the cost consequence of intervening 'late' in the ageing trajectory. The objectives were to promote discussion around preventing functional decline, support innovation in service delivery, and facilitate broader engagement with individuals, communities, and wider environments for improving health and wellbeing in later life. In addition, subsequent learning could help address the increasing resource gap between the demand and capacity across health and social care. Study design: The survey was paper-based in the form of a printed booklet, which contained the 15 activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental ADL (IADL) which comprise the LifeCurve (TM) with additional lifestyle questions and information about the member of staff and service the participant was seen in, including their Community Health Index (CHI) number. The survey questions and booklet layout were tested over a five-month period with AHPs and people receiving AHP services. Liaison with national health literacy colleagues and lead speech and language therapists ensured that the survey material was accessible to a wide range of people. In addition, the survey could be made available in alternative formats, on request. Methods: Agreement to undertake the national survey was obtained in November 2016 by all AHP directors and associate directors who appointed communication support leads in their area who would support implementation at all stages at a local level. All materials relating to the survey were published on a dedicated area of a community of practice to support awareness and training during the pre-implementation phase. AHPs working in adult services were asked to complete a survey with a minimum of two people they would 'typically' see in their service during a two-week period in May 2017, with the exclusion of people who were too unwell to participate, children and young people under 16 years, and adults with incapacity and without a guardianship arrangement in place. Approval was gained from the Public Benefit Privacy Panel to link the survey data to participants' health service usage using their CHI number. Completed forms were returned to the University of Strathclyde for entry into an encrypted electronic database using a double data entry process and were allocated a unique identifier. The unique identifier and CHI numbers were sent to Information Services Division (ISD), and then, the CHI numbers were deleted from the encrypted database. ISD sent the linked health data to the Scottish Government Analytical Services Division, which thus produced a full encrypted and anonymised database. Results: The data explain what stages on the LifeCurve (TM) AHPs are intervening, and the matched data provide associated healthcare costs at each stage. Due to poor or missing data in the AHP/Service section, only 60% (n = 8261) of the total completed surveys were able to be matched with health service usage records. These data show that whilst AHPs are seeing people at each of the 15 ADL/IADL stages on the LifeCurve (TM), interventions fell into three groups where 25% of people where seen at the 'precurve' stage, 13% of people at 'mid-curve' (stage number five), and 39% of people at late-curve' (stages 10 to 13). The healthcare cost usage of these participants increased the further along the LifeCurveTM a person moves, with an average annual cost of 2700 pound at 'precurve' rising to 12,330 pound at late-curve' in 2016-2017. The results indicate that different services and professions are represented at each of these three points. So, for example, as might be expected, outpatient (especially musculoskeletal) services were seen more often at the 'precurve' stage, and in-patient and community rehabilitation, services were seen more often at the late-curve' stages; diagnostic radiographers and orthoptists saw people at the 'early-curve' stages, dieticians and podiatrists saw people at the 'mid-curve' stage, whilst physiotherapists, speech and language therapists, and occupational therapists saw people at the late-curve' stages. Data analysis showed this pattern is different for people receiving mental health services and, so, their data were removed and will be analysed and reported separately. Conclusions: It is clear from the results that healthcare costs increased as participants moved down LifeCurve (TM) stages, that is, as their levels of functional decline increase. It is also clear that AHPs are intervening late in a person's functional decline with associated limitations on changing their ageing trajectory. The cost consequence of this is significant - moving someone from 'late- to mid-curve' could save 3200 pound per person per annum. However, those AHPs typically associated with reabling approaches and rehabilitation, which have greatest potential to change ageing trajectories, were not represented at the 'mid-curve' stage (e.g., physiotherapists, occupational therapists). Therefore, we must find places to have conversations with people to inform them that functional decline is malleable and not inevitable purely by virtue of chronological age and provide education and support to prevent or reverse functional decline and collaborate around strategic planning and commissioning to offer different options that support an optimum LifeCurve (TM).

567,G,"Objectives: Modern slavery is a human rights violation and a global public health concern. To date, criminal justice approaches have dominated attempts to address it. Modern slavery has severe consequences for people's mental and physical health, and there is a pressing need to identify and implement effective preventative measures. As such, a public health approach to modern slavery requires elucidation. The objectives of this study were to explore the case for public health involvement in addressing modern slavery and the components of a public health approach and to develop a globally relevant framework for public health action. Study design: A Rapid Evidence Assessment. Methods: This study is a rapid systematic review of published literature and stakeholder consultation. Results: The accounts of 32 consultees and evidence from 17 papers including reviews, commentaries and primary studies were included in the evidence assessment. A strong ethical rationale for public health engagement in addressing modern slavery was evident. Multilevel and multicomponent interventional strategies were identified across global, national, regional, local and service levels. Although public health could add value to existing approaches, multiple barriers and tensions exist. Conclusion: Published literature and stakeholder opinion indicate an emergent public health approach to modern slavery. It involves intervention at multiple levels and is guided by a rights-based, survivor-centred and trauma-informed approach. This synthesis offers an important early step in the construction of a globally relevant public health approach to modern slavery. (C) 2019 The Royal Society for Public Health.

568,G,"Objectives: The literature suggests that sexual minority young people (SMYP) use alcohol at disproportionate levels when compared with their heterosexual counterparts. Little is known about alcohol dependency symptoms and correlations between high-risk alcohol use/dependency symptoms and minority stress in this population in general and between subgroups. Study design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: Descriptive statistics, adjusted odds ratios, and analysis of covariance were used to determine high-risk alcohol use, dependency symptoms, differences between sub- groups, and correlations between alcohol use, dependency symptoms, and minority stress. Results: A total of 1556 Australian SMYPs aged 18 to 35 years completed the survey. Fifty percent of the participants reported high-risk alcohol consumption with significant differences between subgroups. Typical dependency symptoms such as 'health, social, legal or financial problems due to alcohol consumption' (16.8%, n = 247) were identified in large parts of the sample. High-risk consumption and dependency symptoms were significantly correlated with minority stress. Conclusion: High levels of high-risk alcohol use and dependency symptoms were found, largely consistent with existing literature. However, disparities are not distributed equally in this population, suggesting that future health promotion interventions should focus on SMYP subgroups. Significant correlations between minority stress and dependency symptoms/high-risk use suggest a potential route for future interventions in these populations.

569,G,"Objectives: The purpose of this study was to examine physical activity (PA) attitudes among adolescents in Bangladesh and their associations with sociodemographic, lifestyle and activity-related factors. Study design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: A total of 781 students (52% female; mean age 14.3 years, SD 1.1) from eight secondary schools in Dhaka, Bangladesh, completed a written questionnaire. Exploratory factor analysis was used to derive positive and negative PA attitude measures. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the associations. Results: The most frequent positive attitudes were PA would 'get or keep me in shape' (81%) and 'be fun' (73%). Common negative attitudes were PA 'would make me hot and sweaty' (51%) and 'is hard work' (42%). Multivariable analysis showed that positive PA attitudes were more likely among adolescents who had physical education classes, adolescents involved in school sports, adolescents who ate fresh fruit and vegetables daily, and adolescents who had breakfast regularly. Negative PA attitudes were more likely among girls, adolescents who slept <= 8 h/night, and adolescents who were overweight or obese; and were less common among adolescents who ate fresh fruit and vegetables daily. Conclusions: This study suggests that PA interventions for adolescents should highlight benefits for being in shape and having fun as key components of positive PA attitudes; and address negative attitudes of PA being hot and hard work. Specific strategies may be needed to address negative PA attitudes among girls, adolescents who are overweight or obese, and adolescents with insufficient sleep.

570,G,"Objectives: For population-level screening of malnutrition among adults-especially in developing-country settings-the body mass index (BMI) can be impractical because of logistical requirements for weight and height measurement. We analyzed anthropometric data collected from a large-scale nutritional survey on women of rural Bihar to determine the mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) cutoffs corresponding to standard BMI cutoffs and the predictive accuracies of the determined cutoffs. Study design: It was a cross-sectional study using multistage cluster sampling. Methods: The current analysis used anthropometric data from a study on dietary practices of rural women (adolescents, lactating mothers, and women in the interpregnancy period). The MUAC (cm) cutoffs corresponding to four standard BMI (kg/m(2)) values were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Result: We detected a significant positive correlation between BMI and MUAC (r = 0.81, P < 0.0001). In ROC curve analysis, the MUAC cutoffs corresponding to BMI cutoffs of 18.5, 23, 25, and 30 kg/m(2) were estimated to be 23.2, 26.0, 27.3, and 30.5 kg/m(2), respectively. The predictive accuracy of the determined cutoffs was good, as indicated by the area under the ROC curve for the four different cutoffs-which ranged between 88% and 97%. Other than the cutoff for 'obese' (BMI, 30 kg/m(2)), the Kappa coefficients for the rest of the MUAC cutoffs showed 'substantial' agreement (>0.6) with their BMI counterparts. Conclusion: The results suggest that the cutoffs based on MUAC-a less resource-intensive measure than BMI-can be used for community-based screening of malnutrition among women of Bihar.

571,G,"Objectives: Social relationships may help in maintaining functional status among older adults. This study examined the types of social relationships that were related to functional status among Japanese community-dwelling older adults. Study design: This is a prospective cohort study. Methods: We used baseline data from 2008 and conducted follow-up surveys six years later. Participants included individuals older than 65 years who lived in a suburban community in Japan. The Index of Social Interaction measure was used to assess multiple elements of social relationships. Two functional status outcomes were set: (1) functional decline and (2) functional decline and mortality. A multiple logistic regression model was used to examine the association between social relationships and functional decline six years later. Results: After controlling for age, sex, family structure and disease status in 2008, poor social curiosity (odds ratio [OR] = 1.31, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.69) and interaction (OR = 2.57, 95% CI: 1.20-5.51) were found to be associated with functional decline. Furthermore, social curiosity (OR = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.14-1.69) and interaction (OR = 2.84, 95% CI: 1.44-5.59) were also associated with the composite outcome. Conclusions: Social curiosity and interacting with others were significantly associated with functional status. Promotion of social interaction may be essential for preventing future need for care.

572,G,"Objectives: The Australian National Bowel Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP) offers free 2-yearly immunochemical faecal occult blood testing to individuals aged 50-74 years; national participation in 2015-2016 was 41%. In 2017, a 7-week television-led mass-media campaign to increase participation in the Australian state of Victoria was associated with a 1.31-fold increase in participation for 11 weeks. We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and health benefits of the 2017 campaign and scaled-up equivalent campaigns run over 4 years in Victoria and nationally. Study design: This study used microsimulation modelling. Methods: A comprehensive microsimulation model of colorectal cancer (CRC), Policy1-Bowel, was used to simulate three scenarios. Scenario 1 simulated the 2017 campaign in Victoria; Scenarios 2 and 3 assumed that campaigns were run three times annually from 2019 to 2022 in Victoria and Australia-wide, respectively. Total campaign costs of AUD$1million, AUD$10million, and AUD$40million were assumed for Scenarios 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The incremental effects and costs of the campaign on the NBCSP were assessed. A governmental perspective was used. Results: All campaign scenarios were predicted to be highly cost-effective, with cost-effectiveness ratios under AUD$4,800/life-year saved. The actual 2017 campaign in Victoria is estimated to prevent 319 CRC cases and 183 deaths over the following 40 years. A 4-year campaign would prevent 1,750 CRC cases and 987 deaths if conducted in Victoria, and 8,100 cases and 4,330 deaths if conducted Australia-wide. Conclusion: Mass-media participation campaigns could be highly cost-effective and maximise the potential life-saving impact of bowel screening. These results support ongoing investment in major bowel screening campaigns. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Royal Society for Public Health."
573,G,"Objectives: There is a need to improve efficiency in healthcare delivery without compromising quality of care. One approach is the development and evaluation of behavioural strategies to reduce unnecessary use of common tests. However, there is an absence of evidence on patient attitudes to the use of such approaches in the delivery of care. Our objective was to explore patient acceptability of a nudge-type intervention that aimed to modify blood test requests by hospital doctors. Study design: Single-centre qualitative study. Methods: The financial costs of common blood tests were presented to hospital doctors on results reports for 1 year at a hospital. Focus group discussions were conducted with recent inpatients at the hospital using a semi-structured question schedule. Discussions were transcribed and analysed using qualitative content analysis to identify and prioritise common themes explaining attitudes to the intervention approach. Results: Three focus groups involving 17 participants were conducted. Patients were generally apprehensive about the provision of blood test cost feedback to doctors. Attitudes were organised around themes representing beliefs about blood tests, the impact on doctors and their autonomy, and beliefs about unnecessary testing. Patients thought that blood tests were important, powerful and inexpensive, and cost information could place doctors under additional pressure. Conclusion: The findings identify predominantly positive beliefs about testing and negative attitudes to the use of financial costs in the decision-making of hospital doctors. Public discussion and education about the possible overuse of common tests may allow more resources to be allocated to evidence -based healthcare, by reducing the perception that such strategies to improve healthcare efficiency negatively impact on quality of care.

574,G,"Objectives: There is a lack of evidence on the health-related impacts of being a young carer. This article takes a population approach to young carer research specifically to investigate the prevalence of young carers and explore differences in their health, well-being and future expectations. Study design: This is a cross-sectional regression analysis. Methods: Secondary analysis of a representative Scottish secondary school survey was undertaken. Pupils with caring responsibilities were identified, and their outcomes in terms of physical and mental health and postschool expectations were analysed. Results: Almost one in eight (12%) surveyed reported caring for someone in the household. Young carers' physical and mental health and psychosocial outcomes were significantly poorer, and they were significantly less likely to see themselves entering further or higher education. Conclusion: This research suggests that Glasgow could have many more young carers than previously thought and provides clear evidence that young people's outcomes are influenced by carer status.

575,G,"Objectives: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a major health burden. Although screening is recommended and considered beneficial, further data on its positive effects are needed for worldwide implementation. Study design: The aim of our national multicentre prospective observational study was to reveal and document clinicopathological differences in CRC diagnosed by screening and presented by disease symptoms as well as assess the efficiency of the screening programme in the Czech Republic. Methods: Between March 2013 and September 2015, a total of 265 patients were enrolled in 12 gastroenterology centres across the Czech Republic. Patients were divided into screening and symptomatic groups and compared for pathology status and clinical characteristics. Screening was defined as a primary screening colonoscopy or a colonoscopy after a positive faecal occult blood test in an averagerisk population. Results: The distribution of CRC stages was significantly (statistically and clinically) favourable in the screening group (predominance of stages 0, I and II) compared with the non-screening group (P < 0.001). The presence of distant and local metastases was significantly less frequent in the screening group than in the symptomatic group (P < 0.001). Patients in the screening group had a higher probability of radical surgery (RO) than those diagnosed based on symptoms (P < 0.001). Systemic palliative treatment was indicated in two patients in the screening group compared with 23 patients in the non-screening group (P = 0.018). Conclusion: CRC diagnosed by screening disclosed less advanced clinicopathological characteristics and results in patients with a higher probability of radical surgery (RO) than diagnoses established based on symptoms, with subsequent management differing accordingly between both groups. These results advocate the implementation of a suitable worldwide screening programme. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Royal Society for Public Health."
576,G,"Objectives: To investigate sex differences in sociodemographic and lifestyle correlates of frequent energy drink (ED) consumption in adolescents. Study design: This study was based on data collected among French-speaking Belgian adolescents aged 11-20 years (n = 8137) within the 2018 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children study. Methods: Multiple logistic analyses stratified by sex were performed to estimate the associations between consuming EDs more than once a week, and various sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics. Results: Overall, 14.0% of boys and 7.6% of girls consumed ED more than once a week. For both genders, the likelihood of consuming ED more than once a week was higher among adolescents consuming soft drinks daily (vs. < daily), alcohol weekly (vs. < weekly), spending at least 5 h/day in front of screens (vs. < 5 h/day), and going to bed later than 11:30 PM (vs. < 10:00 PM). Among boys, adolescents reporting at least 1 h of moderate-to -vigorous physical activity (MVPA) daily (vs. < 1 h/day MVPA) were more likely to consume ED more than once a week (adjusted odd ratio (aOR) = 1.49 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11-2.01)). Among girls, adolescents from low affluence families (vs. high affluence) (aOR = 2.03 (95% CI 1.19-3.48)) and immigrants (vs. natives) (2nd generation: aOR = 1.75 (95% CI 1.31 -2.32); 1st generation: aOR = 1.90 (95% CI 1.20-3.03)) were more likely to consume ED more than once a week. Conclusions: We identified different patterns of ED consumption in boys and girls. These results suggest that sex-tailored interventions could be relevant to reduce ED consumption in adolescents.

577,G,"Objectives: The effective reproduction number (R) is a more practical epidemiological parameter than basic reproduction number (R-0) for characterization of infectious disease epidemics as it takes into account presence of immune individuals in the population which R-0 does not. Periodic assessment of R can inform public health strategies during long-standing epidemics such as the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) situation. This is especially relevant for large and resource-poor countries such as India, which may require differential intervention strategies in different regions. However, the complexity of the calculation involved often proves to be a barrier for calculation of R. This communication proposes a simpler data collection and analytical method involving a combination approach instead of fullfledged primary data collection to estimate R for public health decision-making. Study design: Literature review. Methods: Data from available sources (time series data of new cases at population level) can be combined with some primary data (time interval between infection of index and secondary cases in family clusters) that can be collected with little resources. These data can then be fed into an approximationbased method (Wallinga and Lipsitch) for R calculation at the state/regional levels. The calculations can be repeated every fortnight using newly available data. Results: The value of R, estimated using the proposed method, from subsequent periods can be used for assessing the status of the epidemic and values from subsequent periods can be compared for decision-making regarding implementation/modification of control measures. Conclusions: The approximate R may be a little inaccurate but can still prove useful for rough estimation of epidemic evolution and for comparison between different periods, as the extent of error in R values across different periods is likely to be similar. Thus, the approximate R may not only be used to estimate the epidemic change in smaller geographies such as states/regions but also used for making appropriate changes to public health measures for managing a pandemic such as COVID-19.

578,G,"Objectives: This study aimed to examine the link between human mobility and the number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infected people in countries. Study design: Our data set covers 144 countries for which complete data are available. To analyze the link between human mobility and COVID-19 infected people, our study focused on the volume of air travel, the number of airports, and the Schengen system. Methods: To analyze the variation in COVID-19 infected people in countries, we used negative binomial regression analysis. Results: Our findings suggest a positive relationship between higher volume of airline passenger traffic carried in a country and higher numbers of patients with COVID-19. We further found that countries which have a higher number of airports are associated with higher number of COVID-19 cases. Schengen countries, countries which have higher population density, and higher percentage of elderly population are also found to be more likely to have more COVID-19 cases than other countries. Conclusions: The article brings a novel insight into the COVID-19 pandemic from a human mobility perspective.

579,G,"Objectives: Both maternal body mass index (BMI) and smoking during pregnancy have been associated with a range of adverse maternal and infant birth outcomes. This study aimed to identify whether these independent variables had an interacting relationship with small for gestational age in an Australian obstetric cohort. Study design: A retrospective cohort design used data from the Birthing Outcomes System of a major tertiary hospital in Australia. Methods: A total of 14,487 singleton births between January 2008 and December 2013 were included in the analysis. Chi-squared tests and one-way analysis of variance were used for the comparison of categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) were calculated to determine the association of smoking status with the outcome variable of interest, and these are reported for each maternal BMI category. Results: Of the 14,487 women, 716 (4.9%) were underweight (BMI <18 kg/m(2)), 7268 (50.2%) had healthy weight (BMI =19-24 kg/m(2)), 3658 (25.3%) were overweight (BMI = 25-29 kg/m(2)), 1558 (10.8%) had class I obesity (BMI = 30-34 kg/m(2)), 711 (4.9%) had class II obesity (BMI = 35-39 kg/m(2)) and 576 (3.9%) had class III obesity (BMI = 40+ kg/m(2)). Of all women, 10.8% reported being current smokers, 82.0% reported to have never smoked and 4.0% reported to have stopped smoking during or before pregnancy. Smokers with a BMI >40 kg/m(2) were 4.5 (AOR = 4.508; 95% confidence interval: 2.068-9.828) times more likely to give birth to a small-for-gestational-age infant than non-smokers within the same BMI category. This increased risk was not observed in women who ceased smoking before or during pregnancy. Conclusions: Our study supports the efficacy of antismoking policies within maternal public health. In addition, greater support with respect to smoking cessation is indicated for women during pregnancy with an elevated BMI.

580,G,"Objectives: Nucleic acid testing is the gold standard method for the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, large numbers of false-negative results have been reported. In this study, nucleic acid detection and antibody detection (IgG and IgM) were combined to improve the testing accuracy of patients with suspected COVID-19. Study design: The positive rate of nucleic acid detection and antibody detection (IgG and IgM) were compared in suspected COVID-19 patients. Methods: A total of 71 patients with suspected COVID-19 were selected to participate in this study, which included a retrospective analysis of clinical features, imaging examination, laboratory biochemical examination and nucleic acid detection and specific antibody (IgM and IgG) detection. Results: The majority of participants with suspected COVID-19 presented with fever (67.61%) and cough (54.93%), and the imaging results showed multiple small patches and ground-glass opacity in both lungs, with less common infiltration and consolidation opacity (23.94%). Routine blood tests were mostly normal (69.01%), although only a few patients had lymphopenia (4.23%) or leucopenia (12.68%). There was no statistical difference in the double-positive rate between nucleic acid detection (46.48%) and specific antibody (IgG and IgM) detection (42.25%) (P = 0.612), both of which were also poorly consistent with each other (kappa = 0.231). The positive rate of combined nucleic acid detection and antibody detection (63.38%) was significantly increased, compared with that of nucleic acid detection (46.48%) and that of specific antibody (IgG and IgM) detection (42.25%), and the differences were statistically significant (P = 0.043 and P = 0.012, respectively). Conclusions: Nucleic acid detection and specific antibody (IgG and IgM) detection had similar positive rates, and their combination could improve the positive rate of COVID-19 detection, which is of great significance for diagnosis and epidemic control.

581,G,"Objectives: We aimed to investigate possible differences in the aggregated hospital fatality rate from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in France at the early phase of the outbreak and to determine whether factors related to population or healthcare supply before the pandemic could be associated with outcome differences. Study design: This is a nationwide observational study including all French hospitals from January 24, 2020, to April 11, 2020. Methods: We analyzed the aggregated hospital fatality rate. A Poisson regression was performed to investigate associations between characteristics pertaining to populational health, socio-economic context and local healthcare supply at baseline, and the chosen outcome. Results: On April 11, 2020, a total number of 30,960 patients were hospitalized among the 3046 French healthcare facilities, including 6832 patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). A total of 8581 deaths due to COVID-19 had been recorded, with a median mortality rate per 10,000 people per department of 0.53 (interquartile range: 0.29-1.90). There were significant variations between the 95 French departments even after adjusting for outbreak inception (P < 0.001). After multivariable analysis, four factors were independently associated with a significantly higher aggregated hospital fatality rate: a higher ICU capacity at baseline (estimate = 1.47; P = 0.00791), a lower density of general practitioners (estimate = 0.95; P = 0.0205), a lower fraction of activity from the for-profit private sector (estimate = 0.99; P < 0.001), and the ratio of people older than 75 years (estimate = 0.91; P = 0.0023). Conclusions: The aggregated hospital fatality rate from COVID-19 in France seems to vary among geographic areas, with some factors pertaining to local healthcare supply being associated with the outcome.

582,G,"Objectives: The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) introduced to curb the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) also interrupted the transmission of influenza. Study design: This is a descriptive epidemiological study. Methods: Data on changes in the number of reported influenza cases, number of influenza-like illness (ILI) visits, ILI percentage and influenza virus positivity were compared between the first 18 weeks of 2020 and the same period of 2019. Results: The changes in the weekly average number of influenza cases were statistically significant between 2020 and 2019 (-4319 vs -525 per week; P < 0.05). The slopes of regression lines for the number of ILI visits were also statistically significant between 2020 and 2019 (-911 vs -98 per week; P < 0.05). Conclusions: This study found that the prevalence of influenza was substantially decreased when NPIs were implemented for the containment of COVID-19. (C) 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health.

583,G,"Objectives: The objective of this study was to evaluate the spatial relationship between colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality and ambulatory surgery center (ASC) density in Pennsylvania's 67 counties. Study design: This was an ecological study. Methods: Age-adjusted CRC mortality rates were linked to ASC densities per 1,000 people. The data set was analyzed using global, local, and regional Moran's I, to test for randomness in CRC mortality and ASC density. Results: CRC mortality rates (median: 15.30 per 100,000 of the US 2000 standard million population) exhibited hot spots in rural Pennsylvania counties. ASC densities (median: 0.35 providers/km(2) per 1,000 people) showed hot spots in urban southeastern Pennsylvania and cold spots in northern Pennsylvania. Conclusions: CRC mortality rates tended to cluster in rural northern Pennsylvania counties; ASC density tended to cluster in urban southeastern counties, indicating a spatial disparity between needed and provided healthcare resources. There is a need for public health and health system changes to increase the availability of CRC services to rural communities. (C) 2020 The Authors.

584,G,"Objectives: The United States has the highest number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the world, with high variability in cases and mortality between communities. We aimed to quantify the associations between socio-economic status and COVID-19-related cases and mortality in the U.S. Study design: The study design includes nationwide COVID-19 data at the county level that were paired with the Distressed Communities Index (DCI) and its component metrics of socio-economic status. Methods: Severely distressed communities were classified by DCI>75 for univariate analyses. Adjusted rate ratios were calculated for cases and fatalities per 100,000 persons using hierarchical linear mixed models. Results: This cohort included 1,089,999 cases and 62,298 deaths in 3127 counties for a case fatality rate of 5.7%. Severely distressed counties had significantly fewer deaths from COVID-19 but higher number of deaths per 100,000 persons. In risk-adjusted analysis, the two socio-economic determinants of health with the strongest association with both higher cases per 100,000 persons and higher fatalities per 100,000 persons were the percentage of adults without a high school degree (cases: RR 1.10; fatalities: RR 1.08) and proportion of black residents (cases and fatalities: Relative risk(RR) 1.03). The percentage of the population aged older than 65 years was also highly predictive for fatalities per 100,000 persons (RR 1.07). Conclusion: Lower education levels and greater percentages of black residents are strongly associated with higher rates of both COVID-19 cases and fatalities. Socio-economic factors should be considered when implementing public health interventions to ameliorate the disparities in the impact of COVID-19 on distressed communities.

585,C,"We still do not understand how planets form or why extra-solar planetary systems are so different from our own Solar System. However, the past few years have dramatically changed our view of the disks of gas and dust around young stars. Observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array and extreme adaptive-optics systems have revealed that most-if not all-disks contain substructure, including rings and gaps(1-3), spirals(4-6), azimuthal dust concentrations(7) and shadows cast by misaligned inner disks(5,8). These features have been interpreted as signatures of newborn pro-toplanets, but the exact origin is unknown. Here we report the kinematic detection of a few-Jupiter-mass planet located in a gas and dust gap at 130 au in the disk surrounding the young star HD 97048. An embedded planet can explain both the disturbed Keplerian flow of the gas, detected in CO lines, and the gap detected in the dust disk at the same radius. While gaps appear to be a common feature in protoplanetary disks(2,3), we present a direct correspondence between a planet and a dust gap, indicating that at least some gaps are the result of planet-disk interactions."
586,C,"The cold molecular gas in contemporary galaxies is structured in discrete cloud complexes. These giant molecular clouds (GMCs), with 10(4)-10(7) solar masses (M-circle dot) and radii of 5-100 parsecs, are the seeds of star formation(1). Highlighting the molecular gas structure at such small scales in distant galaxies is observationally challenging. Only a handful of molecular clouds were reported in two extreme submillimetre galaxies at high redshift(2-4). Here we search for GMCs in a typical Milky Way progenitor at z = 1.036. Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), we mapped the CO(4-3) emission of this gravitationally lensed galaxy at high resolution, reading down to 30 parsecs, which is comparable to the resolution of CO observations of nearby galaxies(5). We identify 17 molecular clouds, characterized by masses, surface densities and supersonic turbulence all of which are 10-100 times higher than present-day analogues. These properties question the universality of GMCs(6) and suggest that GMCs inherit their properties from ambient interstellar medium. The measured cloud gas masses are similar to the masses of stellar clumps seen in the galaxy in comparable numbers(7). This corroborates the formation of molecular clouds by fragmentation of distant turbulent galactic gas disks(8,9), which then turn into stellar clumps ubiquitously observed in galaxies at 'cosmic noon' (ref.(10))."
587,C,"It is believed that an isolated pulsar loses its rotational energy mainly through a relativistic wind consisting of electrons, positrons and possibly Poynting flux(1-3). As it expands, this wind may eventually be terminated by a shock, where particles can be accelerated to energies of X-ray synchrotron emission, and a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) is usually detectable surrounding a young energetic pulsar(1-3). However, the nature and/or energetics of these physical processes remain very uncertain, largely because they typically cannot be studied in a time-resolved fashion. Here we show that the X-ray PWN around the young pulsar PSR B0540-69 brightens gradually up to 32 +/- 8% over the mean previous flux, after a sudden change in the spin-down rate of similar to 36% in December 2011. This spin-down-rate transition has very different properties from a traditional pulsar glitch(4). No evidence is seen for any change in the pulsed X-ray emission. We conclude that the spin-down-rate transition results from a sudden change in the pulsar magnetosphere that increases the pulsar wind power and hence the PWN X-ray emission. The X-ray light curve of the PWN suggests a mean lifetime of the particles of 397 +/- 374 d, corresponding to a magnetic field strength of 0.78(-0.28)(+4.50) mG in the PWN."
588,C,"Evidence of star-planet interactions in the form of planet-modulated chromospheric emission has been noted for a number of hot Jupiters. Magnetic star-planet interactions involve the release of energy stored in the stellar and planetary magnetic fields. These signals thus offer indirect detections of exoplanetary magnetic fields. Here, we report the derivation of the magnetic field strengths of four hot Jupiter systems, using the power observed in calcium II K emission modulated by magnetic star-planet interactions. By approximating the fractional energy released in the calcium II K line, we find that the surface magnetic field values for the hot Jupiters in our sample range from 20 G to 120 G, around 10-100 times larger than the values predicted by dynamo scaling laws for planets with rotation periods of around 2-4 days. However, these values are in agreement with scaling laws relating the magnetic field strength to the internal heat flux in giant planets. Large planetary magnetic field strengths may produce observable electron cyclotron maser radio emission by preventing the maser from being quenched by the planet's ionosphere. Intensive radio monitoring of hot Jupiter systems will help to confirm these field values and inform the generation mechanism of magnetic fields in this important class of exoplanets."
589,C,"The 2016 Vela glitch observed by the Mount Pleasant radio telescope provides the first opportunity to study pulse-to-pulse dynamics of a pulsar glitch, opening up new possibilities to study the neutron star's interior. We fit models of the star's rotation frequency to the pulsar data, and present the following three results. First, we constrain the glitch rise time to less than 12.6 s with 90% confidence, almost three-times shorter than the previous best constraint. Second, we find definitive evidence for a rotational-frequency overshoot and fast relaxation following the glitch. Third, we find evidence for a slowdown of the star's rotation immediately before the glitch. The overshoot is predicted theoretically by some models; we discuss implications of the glitch rise and overshoot decay times on internal neutron-star physics. The slowdown preceding the glitch is unexpected; we propose the slowdown may trigger the glitch by causing a critical lag between crustal superfluid and the crust."
590,C,"The distribution of size as a function of age observed for star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is very puzzling: young clusters are all compact, while the oldest systems show both small and large sizes. This phenomenon is commonly interpreted as being due to a population of binary black holes driving a progressive expansion of cluster cores. Here we propose, instead, that it is the natural consequence of the fact that only relatively low-mass clusters have formed in the past similar to 3 Gyr in the LMC and only the most compact systems survived and are observable. The spread in size displayed by the oldest (and most massive) clusters, instead, can be explained in terms of initial conditions and internal dynamical evolution. To quantitatively explore the role of the latter, we selected a sample of five coeval and old LMC clusters with different sizes, and we estimated their dynamical age from the level of central segregation of blue straggler stars (the so-called dynamical clock). Similarly to what is found in the Milky Way, we indeed measure different levels of dynamical evolution among the selected coeval clusters, with large-core systems being dynamically younger than those with small size. This behaviour is fully consistent with what is expected from internal dynamical evolution processes over timescales mainly set by the structure of each system at formation."
591,C,"Magnetic fields, while ubiquitous in many astrophysical environments, are challenging to measure observationally. Based on the properties of anisotropy of eddies in magnetized turbulence, the velocity gradient technique is a method synergistic to dust polarimetry that is capable of tracing plane-of-the-sky magnetic fields, measuring the magnetization of interstellar media and estimating the fraction of gravitational collapsing gas in molecular clouds using spectral line observations. Here, we apply this technique to five low-mass star-forming molecular clouds in the Gould Belt and compare the results to the magnetic field orientation obtained from polarized dust emission. We find that the estimates of magnetic field orientations and magnetization for both methods are statistically similar. We estimate the fraction of collapsing gas in the selected clouds. By using the velocity gradient technique, we also present the plane-of-the-sky magnetic field orientation and magnetization of the Smith Cloud, for which dust polarimetry data are unavailable."
592,C,"So far, around 4,000 exoplanets have been discovered orbiting a large variety of stars. Owing to the sensitivity limits of the currently used detection techniques, these planets populate zones restricted either to the solar neighbourhood or towards the galactic bulge. This selection problem prevents us from unveiling the true galactic planetary population and is not set to change for the next two decades. Here, we present a detection method that overcomes this issue and that will allow us to detect massive exoplanets using gravitational-wave astronomy. We show that the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission can characterize new circumbinary exoplanets orbiting white dwarf binaries everywhere in our Galaxy-a population of exoplanets so far completely unprobed-as well as detecting extragalactic bound exoplanets in the Magellanic Clouds. Such a method is not limited by stellar activity and, in extremely favourable cases, will allow LISA to detect planets down to 50 Earth masses."
593,C,"(10) Hygiea is the fourth largest main belt asteroid and the only known asteroid whose surface composition appears similar to that of the dwarf planet (1) Ceres(1,2), suggesting a similar origin for these two objects. Hygiea suffered a giant impact more than 2 Gyr ago(3) that is at the origin of one of the largest asteroid families. However, Hygeia has never been observed with sufficiently high resolution to resolve the details of its surface or to constrain its size and shape. Here, we report high-angular-resolution imaging observations of Hygiea with the VLT/SPHERE instrument (20 mas at 600 nm) that reveal a basin-free nearly spherical shape with a volume-equivalent radius of 217 +/- 7 km, implying a density of 1,944 +/- 250 kg m(-3) to 1 sigma. In addition, we have determined a new rotation period for Hygiea of 13.8 h, which is half the currently accepted value. Numerical simulations of the family-forming event show that Hygiea's spherical shape and family can be explained by a collision with a large projectile (diameter 75-150 km). By comparing Hygiea's sphericity with that of other Solar System objects, it appears that Hygiea is nearly as spherical as Ceres, opening up the possibility for this object to be reclassified as a dwarf planet."
594,C,"Hydrodynamical simulations show that a pair of spiral arms can form in the disk around a rapidly growing young star and that the arms are crucial in transporting angular momentum as the disk accretes material from the surrounding envelope(1-4). Here we report the detection of a pair of symmetric spiral structures in a protostellar disk, supporting the formation of spiral arms in the disk around a forming star. The HH 111 VLA 1 source is a young Class I source embedded in a massive infalling protostellar envelope and is actively accreting, driving the prominent HH 111 jet. Previous observations showed a ring of shock emission around the disk's outer edge(5), indicating accretion of the envelope material onto the disk at a high rate. Now with ALMA observations of thermal emission from dust particles, we detect a pair of spiral arms extending from the inner region to the disk's outer edge, similar to that seen in many simulations(1-4). Additionally, the disk is massive, with a Toomre Q parameter near unity in the outer parts where the spiral structures are detected, supporting the notion that envelope accretion is making the outer disk gravitationally unstable. In our observations, another source, HH 111 VLA 2, is spatially resolved for the first time, showing a disk-like structure with a diameter of similar to 26 au and an orientation nearly orthogonal to that of the HH 111 VLA 1 disk."
595,C,"Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most energetic electromagnetic sources in the Universe, releasing 10(42)-10(47) J (refs. (1,2)) in prompt gamma-ray radiation. Fifty years after their discovery, the physical origin of this emission is still unknown. Synchrotron emission has been an early contender(3,4), but was criticized because spectral fits of empirical models suggest too hard a slope of the low-energy power law, violating the so-called synchrotron line-of-death(5,6), and for its inefficient extraction of energy when the electrons are not fully cooled, reviving models of photospheric emission(7-9). Fitting proper synchrotron spectra(10) (rather than heuristic functions) and taking electron cooling into account was shown to work for several GRB spectra(10-14). Here, we show that idealized synchrotron emission, when properly incorporating time-dependent cooling of the electrons, is capable of fitting similar to 95% of all time-resolved spectra of single-peaked GRBs observed by Fermi's Gamma-ray Burst Monitor. Thus, the past exclusion of synchrotron radiation as an emission mechanism derived via the line-of-death was misleading. Our analysis probes the microphysical processes operating within these ultra-relativistic outflows and provides estimates of magnetic field strengths and Lorentz factors of the emitting region directly from spectral fits. The resulting parameter distributions are largely compatible with theoretical spectral(15-17) and outflow predictions(18). The emission energetics implied by the observed, uncooled electrons remain challenging for all theoretical models."
596,C,"Saturn's convective storms usually fall in two categories. One consists of mid-sized storms similar to 2,000 km wide, appearing as irregular bright cloud systems that evolve rapidly, on scales of a few days. The other includes the Great White Spots, planetary-scale giant storms ten times larger than the mid-sized ones, which disturb a full latitude band, enduring several months, and have been observed only seven times since 1876. Here we report a new intermediate type, observed in 2018 in the north polar region. Four large storms with east-west lengths similar to 4,000-8,000 km (the first one lasting longer than 200 days) formed sequentially in close latitudes, experiencing mutual encounters and leading to zonal disturbances affecting a full latitude band similar to 8,000 km wide, during at least eight months. Dynamical simulations indicate that each storm required energies around ten times larger than mid-sized storms but similar to 100 times smaller than those necessary for a Great White Spot. This event occurred at about the same latitude and season as the Great White Spot in 1960, in close correspondence with the cycle of approximately 60 years hypothesized for equatorial Great White Spots. A series of four storms appeared on Saturn's northern polar region in 2018, unusually close to each other in space and time. By their dimension and the energy needed to form them, they appear to be a hitherto unobserved kind of storm at Saturn, intermediate between the regional- and the global-sized ones."
597,C,"Many cool stars possess complex magnetic fields(1) that are considered to undertake a central role in the structuring and energizing of their atmospheres(2). Alfvenic waves are thought to make a critical contribution to energy transfer along these magnetic fields, with the potential to heat plasma and accelerate stellar winds(3-5). Despite Alfvenic waves having been identified in the Sun's atmosphere, the nature of the basal wave energy flux is poorly understood. It is generally assumed that the associated Poynting flux is generated solely in the photosphere and propagates into the corona, typically through the continuous buffeting of magnetic fields by turbulent convective cells(4,6,7). Here, we provide evidence that the Sun's internal acoustic modes also contribute to the basal flux of Alfvenic waves, delivering a spatially ubiquitous input to the coronal energy balance that is sustained over the solar cycle. Alfvenic waves are thus a fundamental feature of the Sun's corona. Acknowledging that internal acoustic modes have a key role in injecting additional Poynting flux into the upper atmospheres of Sun-like stars has potentially significant consequences for the modelling of stellar coronae and winds."
598,C,"The low temperatures(1,)(2) and high ultraviolet radiation levels(3) at the surface of Mars today currently preclude the survival of life anywhere except perhaps in limited subsurface niches(4). Several ideas for making the Martian surface more habitable have been put forwards(5-)(8), but they all involve massive environmental modification that will be well beyond human capability for the foreseeable futures(9). Here, we present a new approach to this problem. We show that widespread regions of the surface of Mars could be made habitable to photosynthetic life in the future via a solid-state analogue to Earth's atmospheric greenhouse effect. Specifically, we demonstrate via experiments and modelling that under Martian environmental conditions, a 2-3 cm-thick layer of silica aerogel will simultaneously transmit sufficient visible light for photosynthesis, block hazardous ultraviolet radiation and raise temperatures underneath it permanently to above the melting point of water, without the need for any internal heat source. Placing silica aerogel shields over sufficiently ice-rich regions of the Martian surface could therefore allow photosynthetic life to survive there with minimal subsequent intervention. This regional approach to making Mars habitable is much more achievable than global atmospheric modification. In addition, it can be developed systematically, starting from minimal resources, and can be further tested in extreme environments on Earth today."
599,C,"Recent dynamical models of Solar System evolution and isotope studies of rock-forming elements in meteorites have suggested that volatile-rich asteroids formed in the outer Solar System beyond Jupiter's orbit, despite being currently located in the main asteroid belt(1-4). The ambient temperature under which asteroids formed is a crucial diagnostic to pinpoint the original location of asteroids and is potentially determined by the abundance of volatiles they contain. In particular, abundances and C-13/C-12 ratios of carbonates in meteorites record the abundances of carbon-bearing volatile species in their parent asteroids. However, the sources of carbon for these carbonates remain poorly understood(5-8). Here we show that the Tagish Lake meteorite contains abundant carbonates with consistently high C-13/C-12 ratios. The high abundance of C-13-rich carbonates in Tagish Lake excludes organic matter as their main carbon source(5,9). Therefore, the Tagish Lake parent body, presumably a D-type asteroid(10), must have accreted a large amount of C-13-rich CO2 ice. The estimated C-13/C-12 and CO2/H2O ratios of ice in Tagish Lake are similar to those of cometary ice(11,12). Thus, we infer that at least some D-type asteroids formed in the cold outer Solar System and were subsequently transported into the inner Solar System owing to an orbital instability of the giant planets(1,3)."
600,C,"As the diversity of people in higher education grows, universities are struggling to provide inclusive environments that nurture the spirit of free inquiry in the presence of these differences. Throughout my career as an astronomer, I have witnessed these struggles first-hand. Exclusive cultures result in unfulfilled potential of all members of the institution - students, administrators and faculty alike. This Perspective draws on insights from dynamical systems descriptions of conflict developed in the social and behavioural sciences to present a model that captures the convoluted, interacting challenges that stifle progress on this problem. This description of complexity explains the persistence of exclusive cultures and the inadequacy of simple fixes. It also motivates the necessity of prolonged and multifaceted approaches to solutions. It is incumbent on our faculties to recognize the complexities in both problems and solutions, and persevere in responding to these intractable dynamics, on our administrations to provide the consistent structure that supports these tasks, and on all of our constituents to be cognizant of and responsive to these efforts."
601,C,"In the past decade, observations from space and the ground have found water to be the most abundant molecular species, after hydrogen, in the atmospheres of hot, gaseous extrasolar planets(1-5). Being the main molecular carrier of oxygen, water is a tracer of the origin and the evolution mechanisms of planets. For temperate, terrestrial planets, the presence of water is of great importance as an indicator of habitable conditions. Being small and relatively cold, these planets and their atmospheres are the most challenging to observe, and therefore no atmospheric spectral signatures have so far been detected(6). Super-Earths-planets lighter than ten Earth masses-around later-type stars may provide our first opportunity to study spectroscopically the characteristics of such planets, as they are best suited for transit observations. Here, we report the detection of a spectroscopic signature of water in the atmosphere of K2-18 b-a planet of eight Earth masses in the habitable zone of an M dwarf(7)-with high statistical confidence (Atmospheric Detectability Index(5) = 5.0, similar to 3.6 sigma (refs. (8,9))). In addition, the derived mean molecular weight suggests an atmosphere still containing some hydrogen. The observations were recorded with the Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3 and analysed with our dedicated, publicly available, algorithms(5,9). Although the suitability of M dwarfs to host habitable worlds is still under discussion(10-13), K2-18 b offers an unprecedented opportunity to gain insight into the composition and climate of habitable-zone planets."
602,C,"Short-period gas giants (hot Jupiters) on circular orbits are expected to be tidally locked into synchronous rotation, with permanent daysides that face their host stars and permanent nightsides that face the darkness of space(1). Thermal flux from the nightside of several hot Jupiters has been detected, meaning energy is transported from day to night in some fashion. However, it is not clear exactly what the physical information from these detections reveals about the atmospheric dynamics of hot Jupiters. Here we show that the nightside effective temperatures of a sample of 12 hot Jupiters are clustered around 1,100 K, with a slight upward trend as a function of stellar irradiation. The clustering is not predicted by cloud-free atmospheric circulation models(2-4). This result can be explained if most hot Jupiters have nightside clouds that are optically thick to outgoing longwave radiation and hence radiate at the cloud-top temperature, and progressively disperse for planets receiving greater incident flux. Phase-curve observations at a greater range of wavelengths are crucial to determining the extent of cloud coverage, as well as the cloud composition on hot Jupiter nightsides(5,6)."
603,E,"Understanding users' search behavior has largely relied on the information available from search engine logs, which provide limited information about the contextual factors affecting users' behavior. Consequently, questions such as how users' intentions, task goals, and substances of the users' tasks affect search behavior, as well as what triggers information needs, remain largely unanswered. We report an experiment in which naturalistic information search behavior was captured by analyzing 24/7 continuous recordings of information on participants' computer screens. Written task diaries describing the participants' tasks were collected and used as real-life task contexts for further categorization. All search tasks were extracted and classified under various task categories according to users' intentions, task goals, and substances of the tasks. We investigated the effect of different task categories on three behavioral factors: search efforts, content-triggers, and application context. Our results suggest four findings: (i) Search activity is integrally associated with the users' creative processes. The content users have seen prior to searching more often triggers search, and is used as a query, within creative tasks. (ii) Searching within intellectual and creative tasks is more time-intensive, while search activity occurring as a part of daily routine tasks is associated with more frequent searching within a search task. (iii) Searching is more often induced from utility applications in tasks demanding a degree of intellectual effort. (iv) Users' leisure information-seeking activity is occurring inherently within social media services or comes from social communication platforms. The implications of our findings for information access and management systems are discussed."
604,E,"The aim of this article is to investigate the impact of data breach severity on the readability of mandatory data breach notification letters. Using a content analysis approach to determine data breach severity attributes (measured by the total number of breached records, type of data accessed, the source of the data breach, and how the data were used), in conjunction with readability measures (reading complexity, numerical intensity, length of letter, word size, and unique words), 512 data breach incidents from 281 U.S. firms across the 2012-2015 period were examined. The results indicate that data breach severity has a positive impact on reading complexity, length of letter, word size, and unique words, and a negative impact on numerical terms. Interpreting the results collectively through the lens of impression management, it can be inferred that business managers may be attempting to obfuscate bad news associated with high data breach severity incidents by manipulating syntactical features of the data breach notification letters in a way that makes the message difficult for individuals to comprehend. The study contributes to the information studies and impression management behavior literatures by analyzing linguistic cues in notifications following a data breach incident."
605,E,"Digital assets of organizations are under constant threat from a wide assortment of nefarious actors. When threats materialize, the consequences can be significant. Most large organizations invest in a dedicated information security management (ISM) function to ensure that digital assets are protected. The ISM function conducts risk assessments, develops strategy, provides policies and training to define roles and guide behavior, and implements technological controls such as firewalls, antivirus, and encryption to restrict unauthorized access. Despite these protective measures, incidents (security breaches) will occur. Alongside the security management function, many organizations also retain an incident response (IR) function to mitigate damage from an attack and promptly restore digital services. However, few organizations integrate and learn from experiences of these functions in an optimal manner that enables them to not only respond to security incidents, but also proactively maneuver the threat environment. In this article we draw on organizational learning theory to develop a conceptual framework that explains how the ISM and IR functions can be better integrated. The strong integration of ISM and IR functions, in turn, creates learning opportunities that lead to organizational security benefits including: increased awareness of security risks, compilation of threat intelligence, removal of flaws in security defenses, evaluation of security defensive logic, and enhanced security response."
606,E,"A recent publication in Nature reports that public R&D funding is only weakly correlated with the citation impact of a nation's articles as measured by the field-weighted citation index (FWCI; defined by Scopus). On the basis of the supplementary data, we up-scaled the design using Web of Science data for the decade 2003-2013 and OECD funding data for the corresponding decade assuming a 2-year delay (2001-2011). Using negative binomial regression analysis, we found very small coefficients, but the effects of international collaboration are positive and statistically significant, whereas the effects of government funding are negative, an order of magnitude smaller, and statistically nonsignificant (in two of three analyses). In other words, international collaboration improves the impact of research articles, whereas more government funding tends to have a small adverse effect when comparing OECD countries."
607,E,"This study aimed to investigate the underlying business model of organizations that have data sharing at the core of their activities. Previous work has stressed that data-sharing projects need to be sustainable in the long term, and highlighted the need for a deeper understanding of the operation model of existing data-sharing initiatives. To investigate this important issue, we took a qualitative approach to uncover the dynamics of value creation in data sharing. Using a case study method, we examined two data-sharing sites across different areas. We conducted semistructured interviews with managers from data centers and other stakeholders, and reviewed documents about the technical and managerial practices to determine the main characteristics of their business models. In addition, we applied the e3-value modeling methodology to tease out the value flows within each site. Our findings demonstrated the importance of the value network dimension of a business model, as data sharing relies on a set of actors creating and getting value in the process, and the significance of intangible assets. The main contributions of this study include extending current understanding on data-sharing business models by analyzing key dimensions, and uncovering how value is created and transferred in data sharing."
608,E,"Using information theory, we measure innovation systemness as synergy among size-classes, ZIP Codes, and technological classes (NACE-codes) for 8.5 million American companies. The synergy at the national level is decomposed at the level of states, Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSA), and Combined Statistical Areas (CSA). We zoom in to the state of California and in more detail to Silicon Valley. Our results do not support the assumption of a national system of innovations in the U.S.A. Innovation systems appear to operate at the level of the states; the CBSA are too small, so that systemness spills across their borders. Decomposition of the sample in terms of high-tech manufacturing (HTM), medium-high-tech manufacturing (MHTM), knowledge-intensive services (KIS), and high-tech services (HTKIS) does not change this pattern, but refines it. The East Coast-New Jersey, Boston, and New York-and California are the major players, with Texas a third one in the case of HTKIS. Chicago and industrial centers in the Midwest also contribute synergy. Within California, Los Angeles contributes synergy in the sectors of manufacturing, the San Francisco area in KIS. KIS in Silicon Valley and the Bay Area-a CSA composed of seven CBSA-spill over to other regions and even globally."
609,E,"With the significant development of China's economy and scientific activity, its scientific publication activity is experiencing a period of rapid growth. However, measuring China's research output remains a challenge because Chinese scholars may publish their research in either international or national journals, yet no bibliometric database covers both the Chinese and English scientific literature. The purpose of this study is to compare Web of Science (WoS) with a Chinese bibliometric database in terms of authors and their performance, demonstrate the extent of the overlap between the two groups of Chinese most productive authors in both international and Chinese bibliometric databases, and determine how different disciplines may affect this overlap. The results of this study indicate that Chinese bibliometric databases, or a combination of WoS and Chinese bibliometric databases, should be used to evaluate Chinese research performance except in the few disciplines in which Chinese research performance could be assessed using WoS only."
610,E,"Several Academic Social Networking Sites (ASNSs) have been launched in the last few years and their number of members is growing. Researchers using ASNSs come from very divergent scientific backgrounds and academic levels, prompting one to ask the question, What kind of communication and self-presentation behaviors occur within these structures? The qualitative study presented in this article analyzed the communication behavior of a selected sample on ResearchGate (RG). It investigates how researchers present themselves on their personal-profile sites and how they interact with other researchers. Overall, the results show that mostly young male academics without previous connections to each other (for example, faculty colleges) use RG for their scholarly exchanges. In general, communication behavior is characterized by an objective, professional, unemotional choice of words and seldom the use of polite salutations or words of farewell. However, there seems to be a correlation between long discussion and an increased use of colloquial and emotional language. Based on our findings, we derived preliminary practical recommendations for communications on ASNSs to improve the relationships in online academic interactions, to foster inclusiveness of gender and culture, and to reduce insecurity in matters of communication, presentation, and the exchange of scientific data."
611,E,"Human Information Behavior (HIB) research commonly examines behavior in the context of why information is acquired and how it will be used, but usually at the level of the work or everyday-life tasks the information will support. HIB has not been examined in detail at the broader contextual level of intellectual purpose (that is, the higher-order conceptual tasks the information was acquired to support). Examination at this level can enhance holistic understanding of HIB as a """"means to an intellectual end"""" and inform the design of digital information environments that support information interaction for specific intellectual purposes. We investigate information-based ideation (IBI) as a specific intellectual information acquisition and use context by conducting Critical Incident-style interviews with 10 game designers, focusing on how they interact with information to generate and develop creative design ideas. Our findings give rise to a framework of their ideation-focused HIB, which systems designers can leverage to reason about how best to support certain behaviors to drive design ideation. These findings emphasize the importance of intellectual purpose as a driver for acquisition and desired outcome of use."
612,E,"Academic social networking sites seek to bring the benefits of online networking to an academic audience. The ability to make connections to others is a defining characteristic of the sites, but what types of networks are formed, and what are the implications of the structures? This study addressed that question through mixed methods social network analysis, focusing on Academia. edu, ResearchGate, and Twitter, as three of the main sites used by academics in their professional lives. The structure of academics' ego-networks on social networking sites differs by platform. Networks on academic sites were smaller and more highly clustered, whereas Twitter networks were larger and more diffuse. Institutions and research interests define communities on academic sites, compared with research topics and personal interests on Twitter. The network structures reflect differences in how academics conceptualize different sites and have implications in relation to fostering social capital and research impact."
613,E,"Finding relevant publications is a common task. Typically, a researcher browses through a list of publications and traces additional relevant publications. When relevant publications are identified, the list may be expanded by the citation links of the relevant publications. The information needs of researchers may change as they go through such iterative processes. The exploration process quickly becomes cumbersome as the list expands. Most existing academic search systems tend to be limited in terms of the extent to which searchers can adapt their search as they proceed. In this article, we introduce an adaptive visual exploration system named PaperPoles to support exploration of scientific publications in a context-aware environment. Searchers can express their information needs by intuitively formulating positive and negative queries. The search results are grouped and displayed in a cluster view, which shows aspects and relevance patterns of the results to support navigation and exploration. We conducted an experiment to compare PaperPoles with a list-based interface in performing two academic search tasks with different complexity. The results show that PaperPoles can improve the accuracy of searching for the simple and complex tasks. It can also reduce the completion time of searching and improve exploration effectiveness in the complex task. PaperPoles demonstrates a potentially effective workflow for adaptive visual search of complex information."
614,E,"A study of enthusiast car restorers is used to illustrate how an information practice approach can provide information science researchers with a richer, more nuanced understanding of the complex interrelationship between people, technology, and information. An ethnographic approach incorporating both semistructured interviews and in the garage ethnographic observation was employed. Analysis was undertaken using an inductive, thematic approach. The findings demonstrate that participants' information environments are rich and complex. Participants' accounts emphasized the corporeal and embodied nature of the restoration process, and this may account for why they privileged the social networks they had developed, often over many decades, over online resources and communities. The findings indicate that participants are engaged in much more than applied problem solving. What is also evident is that engagement in the social world of car restoration, and the networks of social knowledge sharing it affords, is significant for the emotional support it provides for older men who often lose these networks later in life. In a sense, the participants are not only rebuilding their cars but also their own sense of self."
615,E,"The use of implicit relevance feedback from neurophysiology could deliver effortless information retrieval. However, both computing neurophysiologic responses and retrieving documents are characterized by uncertainty because of noisy signals and incomplete or inconsistent representations of the data. We present the first-of-its-kind, fully integrated information retrieval system that makes use of online implicit relevance feedback generated from brain activity as measured through electroencephalography (EEG), and eye movements. The findings of the evaluation experiment (N = 16) show that we are able to compute online neurophysiology-based relevance feedback with performance significantly better than chance in complex data domains and realistic search tasks. We contribute by demonstrating how to integrate in interactive intent modeling this inherently noisy implicit relevance feedback combined with scarce explicit feedback. Although experimental measures of task performance did not allow us to demonstrate how the classification outcomes translated into search task performance, the experiment proved that our approach is able to generate relevance feedback from brain signals and eye movements in a realistic scenario, thus providing promising implications for future work in neuroadaptive information retrieval (IR)."
616,E,"Information behavior may enhance hypertension self-management in African Americans. The goal of this substudy was to examine the relationships between measures of self-reported health information behavior and neural measures of health information processing in a sample of 19 prehypertensive African Americans (mean age = 52.5, 52.6% women). We measured (a) health information seeking, sharing, and use (surveys) and (b) neural activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess response to health information videos. We hypothesized that differential activation (comparison of analytic vs. empathic brain activity when watching a specific type of video) would indicate better function in three, distinct cognitive domains: (a) Analytic Network, (b) Default Mode Network (DMN), and (c) ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Scores on the information sharing measure (but not seeking or use) were positively associated with differential activation in the vmPFC (rs = .53, p = .02) and the DMN (rs = .43, p = .06). Our findings correspond with previous work indicating that activation of the DMN and vmPFC is associated with sharing information to persuade others and with behavior change. Although health information is commonly conveyed as detached and analytic in nature, our findings suggest that neural processing of socially and emotionally salient health information is more closely associated with health information sharing."
617,E,"Since 2015, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) began the process of inculcating culture as part of the United Nations' (UN) post-2015 Sustainable (former Millennium) Development Goals, which member countries agreed to achieve by 2030. By conducting a thematic analysis of the 25 UN commissioned reports and policy documents, this research identifies 14 broad cultural heritage information themes that need to be practiced in order to achieve cultural sustainability, of which information platforms, information sharing, information broadcast, information quality, information usage training, information access, information collection, and contribution appear to be the significant themes. An investigation of education on cultural heritage informatics and digital humanities at iSchools () using a gap analysis framework demonstrates the core information science skills required for cultural heritage education. The research demonstrates that: (i) a thematic analysis of cultural heritage policy documents can be used to explore the key themes for cultural informatics education and research that can lead to sustainable development; and (ii) cultural heritage information education should cover a series of skills that can be categorized in five key areas, viz., information, technology, leadership, application, and people and user skills."
618,E,"The """"sharing economy"""" has recently emerged as a major global phenomenon in practice and is consequently an important research topic. What, precisely, is meant by this term, """"sharing economy""""? The literature to date offers many, often incomplete and conflicting definitions. This makes it difficult for researchers to lead a coherent discourse, to compare findings and to select appropriate cases. Alternative terms (e.g., """"collaborative consumption,"""" """"gig economy,"""" and """"access economy"""") are a further complication. To resolve this issue, our article develops a consolidated (based on all prior work) and systemic (relating to the phenomenon in its entire scope) definition of the sharing economy. The definition is based on the detailed analysis of definitions and explanations in 152 sources identified in a systematic literature review. We identify 36 original understandings of the term """"sharing economy."""" Using semantic integration strategies, we consolidate 84 semantic facets in these definitions into 18 characteristics of the sharing economy. Resolving conflicts in the meaning and scope of these characteristics, we arrive at a consolidated, systemic definition. We evaluate the definition's appropriateness and applicability by applying it to cases claimed by the media to be examples of the sharing economy. This article's definition is useful for future research and discourse on the sharing economy."
619,F,"The purpose of this paper is to make a quantitative and qualitative critical analyse regarding the three important aspects of stock market evolution. First, the forecasting problems are presented and analyse in order to establish the main problems and the potential solutions. Second, the valuation problems are tackled in order to observe different trends and directions of solving these issues. Third, the portfolio return forecasts are mandatory in order to establish the results of the titles/market evolutions. The methods used in this research reveal the importance of adopting some important econometric tools in order to test the robustness of different main theories of the stock market and some important practices used among investors. The scope of the research was to give a quid pro quo in order to confer potential solutions regarding problems, paradoxes and efficient information of the stock market. The empirical results reveal that besides the critical side of the theories this paper sets a basis for a new eclectic approach regarding the probabilities that a title achieves certain values within a reasonable time frame. The main conclusion of this article suggests' that the current theories register some gaps regarding the adherence into stock markets' realities."
620,F,"This-study examines the influence of client preference with respect to information search behavior and subsequent tax recommendation. Prior studies have identified that tax consultants exhibit confirmation bias in their information search processes, which is explained by the theory of motivated reasoning (Kunda, 1990). However, that theory does not take into consideration responses of tax consultant that are attributable to the way clients present their preferences. This study fills the gap by proposing a social norm activation model which can help to foster a better understanding of the nature of the confirmatory behavior. To accomplish this purpose, study participants role-played as advisors on a tax compliance task. The experiment used aweb-based instrument that involved 82 tax professionals. Results showed that tax consultants engaged inlower confirmation bias when they received an explicitly preference statement from their client than those who received an implicit statement. Furthermore, the former tax consultants recommended a more conservative tax position than the latter. 'These findings underscore the importance of social norm in a professional tax work environment. As a practical contribution, these findings suggest that the beliefs and norms of tax professionals influence the way they do their work."
621,F,"The stochastic nature of investment process implies that it should be treated not unambiguously. Instead of concentrating only on possible return, it is worth analysing three parameters when we discuss the future investment results. These parameters are return possibility, reliability of this possibility, and the riskiness. The stochastic informative expert system for investment allows to analyse the behaviour of financial markets, forecasting the dynamics of stock prices and, along with that, rationally allocating investment resources. The proposed system is based on the adequate portfolio model, previously developed by the authors. Considering the real-time characteristics of financial markets, the system can be useful for individual investors, as well as for institutional investors, such as investment funds. Also, the authors propose the original risk tolerance determination methodology, which divides investors into three categories according their risk tolerance. The system can be applicable not only to capital markets, but also to other business or macroeconomic processes. As an example, a portfolio of the interaction of macroeconomic indicators with USA, UK, and Lithuanian data is developed. Such results could be useful for economists and governments in order to attain the higher value added in a particular country."
622,F,"This study utilizes prospectuses and supplementary valuation reports to investigate the relationship between underwriters' valuation and underpricing in 113 firms going public on Borsa Istanbul. It argues that underwriter discretion in the valuation is crucial to underpricing in the Turkish market, where fixed price is the dominant method of offering and retail investor allocation is large. Building on the overpricing theories, the study hypothesizes and finds that optimistic valuation bias is a significant determinant of underwriter discounts, and underwriter discounts are negatively associated with initial returns. One standard deviation increase in deliberate discounts is associated with a 30.4% reduction in underpricing. The median underwriter discount in the sample is 21%, while the median market-adjusted initial return is a small 1.45%, indicating that discounts might not be designed to induce underpricing and reward investors. Book-built offerings are overvalued and overdiscounted; however, not underpriced, contrasting the information extraction view."
623,F,"In the current scenario of increasing social inequality, the debate over the compensation received by directors and executives of large listed companies, and its justification, has intensified. Drawing on Agency Theory and Human Capital Theory, a multilevel analytical technique is used in this paper to examine the influence of firm-level variables and director-level variables on the individual compensation of the members of the board. The results obtained for the continental European context (Spain in particular) partially support the Human Capital Theory. Nevertheless, there is no evidence supportive of Agency Theory, as corporate governance mechanisms do not contribute to moderate the compensation of directors and there is no relationship between corporate performance and the compensation of directors. The analyses by subsamples (categories of directors) reveal that non-executive director's compensation seems to be set for a group of individuals as a whole, depending mainly on firm-level characteristics, whereas executive director compensation is more based on the unique characteristics that a particular executive brings to the board."
624,F,"This paper investigates the effect of bank competition and financial stability on economic growth by examining panel-data from 38 European countries over 2001 to 2017. Bank competition is measured with the Boone indicator, and bank stability with Z-scores and non-performing loan ratio, all at the country level. This study employs a fixed-effect estimator, as well as a system generalized method of moment (GMM) estimator to control unobserved heterogeneity, endogeneity, the dynamic effect of economic growth, and reverse causality in its estimation. Results show that bank stability significantly contributes to economic growth in Europe. Economic growth falls during crisis periods (both the global financial crisis and the local banking crisis), highlighting the importance of a resilient banking system during crisis periods. Moreover, empirical outcomes show that lower banking competition supports economic growth and increases financial stability. This study provides a framework for banks and regulators to boost economic growth through the channel of banking stability."
625,F,"Research dedicated to entrepreneurship has, from the very beginning, created a gender gap as it was mostly considered to be the masculine one. Studies with the main focus on psychological characteristics of entrepreneurs are mostly based on a comparison with other professionals, rarely approaching gender differences. Using the mixture of general personal and entrepreneurial traits, this study investigates entrepreneurial dilemma and answers the question whether entrepreneurship can or cannot be gendered, using a sample of potential entrepreneurs. Based on the multivariate analysis of variance, this study empirically proves that there are no statistically significant differences between the genders according to any criteria, except fir the criterion of worry, which is more pronounced in women than in men. This study offers a good basis for the implementation of the existing models in different areas of entrepreneurship research, extending its understanding from the gender perspective. From the practical point of view, it provides a deeper understanding of entrepreneurial traits that might be critical for designing support and educational programs for enhancing (female) entrepreneurship."
626,F,"This paper analyses which variables influence the disappearance of mutual funds in the Spanish market and whether these variables vary depending on the investment objectives. The following variables are tested: age, size, investment flows, return, volatility, Sharpe ratio, Morningstar rating, and fund family. The Kaplan-Meier estimator and an extension of the Cox model, the Andersen-Gill model arc used and the results indicate that the impact of some variables on survival capacity is different depending on the fund's investment objectives. The originality of this article is twofold. The analysis of disappearance takes the investment objectives of the mutual funds into account and a new variable, the Morningstar rating, is introduced. Moreover, no previous study examines survival capacity in the Spanish market according to different investment objectives. In Spain, mutual funds are highly concentrated because most of them are in the hands of a small number of banks who also control the country's largest fund families. This characteristic not only makes the Spanish market an interesting one for analysis, but it also means that the results of this paper are significant for mutual fund investors."
627,F,"The aim of this study is to explore and elaborate the concept of hybrid entrepreneurship, i.e., a simultaneous mix of self-employment (entrepreneurship) and salary employment. Lazear's theory of entrepreneurship is assessed in terms whether it can explain the phenomenon of being a hybrid entrepreneur. The hypothesis is that the probability of linking a salary job with one's own business increases with the variety and level of education gained, the broadness of professional and management experience but also the level of entrepreneurial self-efficacy. The hypotheses are tested with multivariate logistic regression, using survey data gathered from 1600 entrepreneurs. In light of the results, Lazear's theory cannot be unambiguously extended to the case of hybrid entrepreneurs. Although the probability of being a hybrid entrepreneur increases with broader professional and managerial experience, at the same time it diminishes as the level and diversity of education increase. The results suggest that hybrid entrepreneurs are an importantly discrete population and therefore need to be treated separately. The theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed."
628,F,"This article focuses on the optimal international trade policy considered product differentiations. A duopoly model with a home firm in a developing country and a foreign firm in a developed country is established. The findings indicate that, the optimal tariff relies on the product differentiations significantly. On one hand, higher marginal cost of home firms have opposite effects on optimal tariff compared to higher marginal cost of foreign firms. On the other hand, the optimal tariff is monotonically decreasing in the amount of consumers caring about brands and increasing in the scale of consumers not caring about brands. Moreover, an increase in the marginal cost and transportation cost of imported goods triggers price rising in domestic market as the market power of home firms is consolidated. In addition, a foreign firm may withdraw from domestic market if its competitive advantages vanishes under high tariffs."
629,F,"In today's competitive environment, the marketing is an imperative tool for the survival and sustainable growth of any business or product. The objective of the undertaken research is to investigate the guerrilla marketing techniques for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and their impact on consumers' purchase decision. Researchers have also the aim to examine the impact of brand awareness and technology as mediating and moderating variables respectively in the guerrilla marketing process. A survey is undertaken by potential consumers through structured questionnaire via a quantitative method of inquiry The data is analyzed mainly through; SEM-based structural modelling such as exploratory and confirmatory factors analysis, and conditional process analysis. The results unveil that guerrilla marketing techniques consisting of viral marketing, strange occurrences, street graphics, and memorable events have a positive and significant influence on the purchase decision. Findings of the undertaken research further demonstrated that brand awareness is a potent mediating variable that significantly enhances the influence of purchase decision, and technology played a vital role as a moderator that has a cogent impact between guerrilla marketing techniques and purchase decision of consumers. Thus, the empirical testing confirmed the importance of modified model of guerrilla marketing, which will be benefitled to both marketing practitioners and future researchers."
630,F,"A consequence of similar institutional conditions of domestic labor markets in Europe is the permanent occurrence of the """"labor hoarding"""" phenomenon, which entails non-immediate adaptation of employment to production changes. The article verifies whether the phenomenon of labor hoarding occurs in the European Union countries and what is its level and the direction of changes between 1996 and 2016. """"the empirical study of employment adjustments to the production volume showed that in the examined period the phenomenon of labor hoarding occurred in all countries of the European Union (excluding Spain). Labor hoarding was accomplished through a slight adjustment of the number of employees to production changes. At the same time, it was noticed that the companies were more flexible with adjusting the number of hours worked. This was particularly evident during global crises and was the consequence of other vital changes in national economies."
631,F,"Implementation, deployment and maintenance of enterprise software pre-configured products are one of the key challenges managers need to address in order to stay competitive in the never ending search to find better ways of conducting business. In the literature there are discovered two general approaches through which managers can use for a successful implementation, deployment and maintenance of enterprise software products. First approach is based on the internal re-deployment of the managerial practices that are already used to manage other fields in the enterprise. Second the deployment of """"world-wide"""" industry """"best practices"""" that international vendors of enterprise software and their local representatives sell as part of their pre-configured software products. This paper presents a novel model that enables enterprises to systematically evaluate the fit between their specific organizational characteristics and the organizational characteristics complementary with successful deployment of international pre-configured enterprise software products. The proposed model is tested through a comparison of two groups of enter-prises from the population of 1000 biggest enterprises in Slovenia. The first group mostly invests in local, while the second group mostly invests in international enterprise software products. The paper finds that on average there are significant and relevant differences in 44% of the examined organizational characteristics between the groups of enterprises that mostly invest in international or local enterprise software products. The model serves as a comprehensive organizational risk checklist for enterprises that are about to invest in enterprise software products."
632,F,"This paper studies the evolutionary characteristics of international trade of potassium salts. We construct a weighted and directed complex network model of potassium salt trade, analyze the scale and activity, trade relations, trade flow distribution and the importance of trading countries using UN Comtrade 2000-2016 data. Results show that potassium salt trade is more dynamic, resource allocation is more convenient. Some countries have formed trade groups. 'Hie relationship between small and major countries is growing. The resource flows of countries with large degrees are conducive to balancing resource's distribution. Besides Canada is a leading trade country, and the US, the Russian Federation, China and Brazil are trade-led countries. China, the Netherlands, the US, France and India arc important hubs. Finally, using Porter's national competitive advantage theory, it proposes countermeasures for forming the international competitive advantage of potassium salt enterprises in different countries."
633,F,"This study seeks to establish the relationship between carbon emissions, agricultural output and industrial output in South Africa. It uses data from 1960 to 2017 based on an annual frequency, giving a total of 58 annual observations. The Autoregressive Distributed Lag technique is employed to estimate the model on a bivariate basis. The evidence shows that carbon emissions are not influenced by agricultural and industrial output. Conversely, agricultural output is influenced by carbon emissions and industrial output. The results suggest that climate change resulting from carbon emissions has led to reduced agricultural output, adversely affecting food security. The significant relationship between industrial and agricultural output suggests that a properly functioning industrial sector will cause an increase in the agricultural output. The study's findings have implications for climate change and manufacturing policies in South Africa."
634,F,"Analysing the impact of agricultural performance on foreign trade concentration and competitiveness defines an important step in identifying the opportunities, challenges and proactive measures in designing a functional and marked based agricultural model. The scope of this study is to investigate the evolution of Romania's the foreign trade competitiveness and its concentration on main destinations during 2007-2016. In this context, in the paper are identified and investigated some of the competitiveness' mutations arisen from the Romania's trade flows concentration and restructuration in relation with 26 of the European Union member states. It was used a unique dataset on agro -food trade output and concentration across EU countries to construct measures of trade competitiveness. The results obtained suggest the existence of a dual relationship of the Romanian agriculture competitiveness and its dependence on the EU economic area, by the concentration of the commercial relationships."
635,F,"Quality credit has attracted considerable interest in both academia and business world in recent years in China. This study aims to discuss the development of quality credit evaluation system, and then based on an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to construct an evaluation system for Internet companies. Firstly, the quality credit evaluation three-level pyramid model for Internet companies has been established, including the willingness of quality credit, the ability of quality credit, and the basis of quality credit. Secondly, priorities of the criteria and sub-criteria are assigned and identified by the AHP with 12 experts those who are representatives from Internet companies, research experts, and government staffs. Finally, several US Internet companies are evaluated by using this evaluation system, and practical suggestions are provided for the future based on data evaluation results. This paper finds that in the criteria of quality credit evaluation system, the most significant indicators are credit records and quality of product, while qualification rate of product supervise, operating legitimacy and quality accident are the most primary indicators in the sub-criteria level."
636,F,"This paper offers an in-depth examination of the behavior of necessity- and opportunity-driven entrepreneurship. First, it considers their relevance to total entrepreneurial activity. It then seeks to determine which socio-cultural and economic factors affect the two types of entrepreneurship, as well as their relative importance for a sample of 32 previously selected countries during a period of expansion (2001-2008) and of crisis and recovery (2009-2016). The analyzed factors include monetary and fiscal policy instruments (economic factors) and representative variables of governance and human capital (socio-cultural ones). The findings show that both necessity- and opportunity-driven entrepreneurship largely explain the behavior of total entrepreneurial activity. They moreover show that the explanatory factors of both kinds of entrepreneurship differ depending on the business cycle phase considered. These findings will be key to proposing efficient economic policy measures to promote entrepreneurial activity and, thus, economic growth in different economies around the world."
637,F,"There is evidence that indicate a positive relationship of learning orientation (LO) with organizational performance in SMEs of emerging economies. However, there are only few studies that investigate how each one of the dimensions of learning orientation (LO) contributes to variables of results such as competitiveness and organizational performance. The purpose of this study is to analyze the direct effects of each dimension of the construct (LO) with organizational performance and competitiveness, from a quantitative cross-sectional study implemented in 400 SMEs of Aguascalientes city, Mexico using SEM technique. The findings reveal that there is a direct and significant relationship between commitment to learning and shared vision with competitiveness; open-mindedness turned out to have a non-significant positive relationship with competitiveness. While the relationship of open-mindedness and commitment to learning have a positive and significant influence on organizational performance, not so shared vision that has a negative and significant influence on organizational performance. The originality of this paper, is that there is limited contributions of the relationship of LO with each dimension of competitiveness, and performance in SMEs worldwide. Among the implications found it is that the existing evidence may result different in other economies and large businesses."

The results show that i) an increase in investor attention negatively predicts stock returns when cumulative daily return of a stock listed on """"Dragon and Tiger"""" list on listing day is negative; ii) Investor attention is negatively correlated with stock returns when the stock entered in """"Dragon and Tiger' list experienced current cumulative monthly return is negative; iii) Investor attention is negatively correlated with stock returns when monthly cumulative net purchase amount of top 10 institution to the stock listed in """"Dragon and Tiger"""" list is negative; iv) Investor attention is negatively correlated with stock returns when the stock listed in """"Dragon and Tiger"""" list, the ratio of monthly cumulative trading amount of the top 10 institutional traders to total trading amount of the secondary market is in the bottom 30 percentile. These findings not only contribute to the academic research about the relationship between investor attention and stock return, but also provide some guidance to the financial regulatory agencies as to the capital market stability."
639,G,"Objectives: In England, in 2013, responsibility for some public health (PH) functions transferred from the National Health Service (NHS) to local government. This moved PH from a health-focussed into a broader and more politically oriented context. This article reports on the perceptions of those involved in this transition about how the PH function was changing as it transited to local government. Study design: This is a cross-sectional interview study. Methods: The study included semi-structured interviews with 31 local government councillors, directors and deputy directors of PH, PH team members and members of clinical commissioning groups. Interviews and data analysis were informed by a theoretical framework, COM-B and an inductive and deductive approach was taken to identify relevant themes. Results: There was a mixed picture of perceived gains and losses for PH. The transition from NHS to local government was seen by some as a 'homecoming', providing the opportunity for PH to have further reach through influence and collaboration with departments like housing, transport and planning. The opportunity to promote evidence-based practice across local government was also seen as a positive aspect of the transition. However, professional roles of PH and individual PH practitioners were perceived to have less influence and autonomy than in the NHS, with some uncertainty about roles within local government. PH practitioners perceived the need to develop other skills to fulfil their roles in local government. Shorter timescales for action and pressure for faster responses were reported to be the reason for less emphasis on using PH evidence to inform policy and decision-making than hitherto in the NHS. Conclusion: This study illustrates a variety of consequences of transitioning from NHS to local government. There were perceived benefits afforded by proximity to related local government departments but at the costs of reduction in status for PH practitioners and working to a timescale which in some cases reduced drawing on scientific evidence.

640,G,"Objectives: The aim of the study is to assess the use and levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) occurring in innovative playgrounds in London vs. traditional playgrounds in the US in neighborhoods with a similar population density. Study design: This is a cross-sectional observational study. Methods: We selected a sample of London playgrounds based on their innovative design. One group of eight playgrounds was matched to the US playgrounds by size and population density; a second group of very large London playgrounds was matched only by population density. Playground use and person-hours of MVPA were measured using direct observation at similar times of the day and days of the week in all locations. Results: The number of playground visit hours was 58% higher in London than in the US (394 vs 249). The matched London playgrounds had 37.8% more children and 129% more adults who were, respectively, engaging in 90% and 116% more MVPA. While the London playgrounds were nearly 8.5 times larger than the US ones, they attracted a total of 5.8 times more visitors (1399 vs 243, P < .0001), and this included 10 times as many adults (679 vs. 66, P < .0001) and 7.5 times more seniors (23 vs. 3). The London playgrounds included more amenities targeting adults. Conclusions: The design of an innovative playground was associated with the amount of MVPA in similar-sized playgrounds, but the size of the playground was more strongly associated with the number of visitors. It is as important to design playgrounds for adults as it is for children to increase visit hours. (C) 2019 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
641,G,"Objectives: Without urgent action, climate change will put the health of future populations at risk. Policies to reduce these risks require support from today's populations; however, there are few studies assessing public support for such policies. Willingness to pay (WtP), a measure of the maximum a person is prepared to pay for a defined benefit, is widely used to assess public support for policies. We used WtP to investigate whether there is public support to reduce future health risks from climate change and if individual and contextual factors affect WtP, including perceptions of the seriousness of the impacts of climate change. Study design: A cross-sectional British survey. Methods: Questions about people's WtP for policies to reduce future climate change-related deaths and their perceptions of the seriousness of climate change impacts were included in a British survey of adults aged 16 years and over (n=1859). We used contingent valuation, a survey-based method for eliciting WtP for outcomes like health which do not have a direct market value. Results: The majority (61%) were willing to pay to reduce future increases in climate change-related deaths in Britain. Those regarding climate change impacts as not at all serious were less willing to pay than those regarding the impacts as extremely serious (OR 0.04, 95% CI 0.02-0.09). Income was also related to WtP; the highest-income group were twice as likely to be willing to pay as the lowest-income group (OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.40-3.29). Conclusions: There was public support for policies to address future health impacts of climate change; the level of support varied with people's perceptions of the seriousness of these impacts and their financial circumstances. Our study adds to evidence that health, including the health of future populations, is an outcome that people value and suggests that framing climate change around such values may help to accelerate action.

642,G,"Objectives: Migration is a complex and contested topic of public debate. Professionals working in public health must negotiate this politicised complexity, yet few studies examine the perspectives and practices of public health professionals in relation to migrant health. This study seeks to redress this by exploring how migrant health is conceptualised and addressed by public health professionals after a key transitional point in the reorganisation of public health in England and the public vote for the UK to leave the EU. Study design: This is a qualitative in-depth exploratory study. Methods: Ten interviews and one focus group were conducted with 14 public health professionals working at Public Health England or local authorities in an English region. Recordings were transcribed, and thematic analysis was conducted. Results: Professionals viewed migrant health mainly through a health inequalities lens; migrants were considered vulnerable, and their health was often determined by wider social issues. This influenced public health professionals' perceived ability to affect change. Public health professionals were greatly influenced by the societal, policy and institutional, post-Brexit vote context in England, describing nervousness around addressing migrant health. At an institutional level, public health professionals described a sense that migrant health was not prioritised. It was considered 'too hard' and complex, especially with shrinking resources and highly politicised social narratives. Consequently, migrant health was often not directly addressed in current practice. The gaps identified by public health professionals were as follows: lack of knowledge of health needs and cultural difference; lack of access to appropriate training; lack of cultural diversity within the public health workforce; and concerns about meaningful community engagement. Conclusions: These findings raise concerns about public health professionals' ability to address the health needs of migrants living in England. The gaps highlighted require further and deeper examination across relevant organisations including the broader public health infrastructure in the UK.

643,G,"Objective: The aim of the study was to examine the association between income inequality and experiences of past-year intimate partner violence. Study design: Multiple country population-based surveys. Methods: We examined associations between experiences of past year physical or sexual violence perpetrated by an intimate partner and income inequality using correlation tests. Income inequality was measured using both the Gini coefficient and ratios between the incomes of the richest 10% and the poorest 10%; data on gross domestic product (GDP) per capita were also retrieved. All income data were sourced from Human Development Reports closest to the year each violence survey was administered. Results: A positive association between income inequality and intimate partner violence was statistically significant using either the 10:10 ratio of income inequality (r = 0.78, P = 0.003) or the Gini coefficient (r = 0.69, P = 0.011). Including GDP per capita as a covariate slightly strengthened these associations (r = 0.79, P = 0.004 and r = 0.73, P = 0.011, respectively). Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first quantitative study of societal income inequality and intimate partner violence. Despite the small sample of countries, there is a significant association between higher inequality and higher levels of violence. (C) 2019 The Royal Society for Public Health.

644,G,"Objective: Religiousness has been found to protect against depression based on studies conducted in the United States, though there are limited data in the European population. We sought to evaluate the associations between religiousness and six depressive symptoms in Europeans aged 50+ years. Study design: Longitudinal study. Methods: Our sample consisted of participants (n = 23,864) in wave 1 (2004-05) of the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe who were followed up in waves 2-6 (2006-07 to 2015). Analyses were conducted using multivariable logistic regression. Results: Higher frequency of prayer was associated with lower odds of having no hopes for the future (odds ratio [OR] = 0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.81-0.99) and of suicidal thoughts (OR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.72-0.97). Attending religious service was associated with lower odds of having no hopes for the future (OR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.67-0.83), of suicidal thoughts (OR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.59-0.81), difficulty in concentration (OR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.72 -0.88), irritability (OR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.71-0.85), fatigue (OR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.78-0.91), and having no enjoyable activity (OR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.76-0.94). Religious education was associated with lower odds of not having engaged in any enjoyable activities lately (OR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.78-0.95). Restful religiousness was associated with lower odds of experiencing suicidal thoughts, of having been irritable recently, and of having experienced fatigue in the last month, compared with crisis religiousness. Crisis religiousness was associated with higher odds of having been irritable recently and of having experienced fatigue in the last month compared with non-religiousness. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that religiousness is associated with lower odds of depressive symptoms, particularly for those who attend religious service.

645,G,"Objectives: Previous research indicates that the impact of immigration on health tends to be specific as it is influenced by many factors such as life stage and host country. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between immigration and adolescent health within the multicultural context of the Brussels-Capital Region in Belgium. Study design: The study was based on the 2014 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children survey. The sample consisted of 2962 adolescents from the fifth grade of primary to the last grade of secondary schools in Brussels. Methods: Associations between health indicators and immigration status were analysed using multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics. Results: Natives, first-generation immigrants, second-generation immigrants with both parents born abroad and second-generation immigrants with one parent born abroad represented 19%, 23%, 36% and 22% of the respondents, respectively. Sociodemographic characteristics and health behaviours varied according to immigrant status. Young immigrants were more likely to present overweight (odds ratio [OR] first-generation immigrants vs. natives = 1.76 [95% confidence interval {CI} = 1.16-2.65]; OR second-generation immigrants with both parents born abroad vs. natives = 2.06 [95% CI = 1.41-3.02]; OR second-generation immigrants with one parent born abroad vs. natives = 1.69 [95% CI = 1.12-2.56]). This effect turned out to be partially explained by sociodemographic status and health-related behaviours. No association was detected between immigration and self-rated health and multiple recurrent symptoms. Conclusions: Discrepancies in health behaviours and weight status were identified between adolescents of different immigration background, whereas this was not the case for well-being. Socio-economic status, cultural characteristics and specific behaviours partly explained these findings. Future research is needed to better understand immigration-related risk and protective factors, at individual and school levels. (C) 2019 The Royal Society for Public Health.

646,G,"Objectives: The aim of the study is to increase seat belt (SB) use and reduce motor vehicle (MV) injuries and death; eight tribal communities implemented evidence-based strategies from the Guide to Community Preventive Services during 2010-2014. Study design: SB use was measured through direct observational surveys and traffic safety activity data. Traffic safety activities included enhanced enforcement campaign events, ongoing enforcement of SB laws, and media. The number of MV injuries (including fatal and non-fatal) was measured through MV crash data collected by police. Results: Percentage change increases in SB use were observed in all eight projects; average annual increases of three projects were statistically significant (ranging from 10% to 43%). Four of the eight projects exceeded their goals for percentage change increases in SB use. Approximately 200 media events and 100 enforcement events focused on SB use were conducted across the eight projects. Five projects had an annual average of >= 100 SB use citations during the project period. MV injuries (fatal and non-fatal combined) significantly decreased in three projects (ranging from a 10% to 21% average annual decrease). Conclusions: Increases in SB use and decreases in the number of MV injuries can be achieved by tailoring evidence-based strategies to tribal communities. (C) 2019 The Royal Society for Public Health.

647,G,"Introduction: Across Europe, large numbers of Gypsy Roma Traveller communities experience significant health inequities such as higher morbidity, mortality and infant mortality. This health inequity is perpetuated by wider determinants such as a lower social status, lower educational attainment and substandard accommodation. This is not dissimilar to other indigenous peoples, even though many Gypsy Roma Traveller communities are not identified as indigenous. Methods: This article presents contemporary literature and research alongside the internationally agreed principles of indigenous peoples, examining similarities between Gypsy Roma Traveller communities and other indigenous peoples. Results: We argue that Gypsy Roma Traveller communities could be recognised as indigenous in terms of the internationally agreed principles of indigeneity and shared experiences of health inequity, colonisation and cultural genocide. Doing so would enable a more robust public health strategy and development of public health guidelines that take into account their cultural views and practices. Conclusion: Recognising Gypsy Roma Traveller communities in this way is important, especially concerning public health, as formal recognition of indigeneity provides certain rights and protection that can be used to develop appropriate public health strategies. Included within this are more nuanced approaches to promoting health, which focus on strengths and assets rather than deficit constructs that can perpetuate problematising of these communities.

648,G,"Objectives: This analysis explored the level of psychological distress among primary school teachers in the South West of England as compared with clinical and general population samples. Study design: Secondary analysis of data from the Supporting Teachers and Children in Schools (STARS) trial completed by up to 90 teachers at baseline, 9, 18 and 30 months of follow-up. Methods: We used the Everyday Feelings Questionnaire (EFQ) as a measure of psychological distress. Baseline data on teachers were compared with a population sample of professionals and a clinical sample of patients attending a depression clinic. Results: Our teacher cohort experienced higher levels of psychological distress than comparable professionals from the general population, which were sustained over 30 months of follow-up. Levels of psychological distress were lower than those found in the clinical sample. Using a cut-point indicative of moderate depression, our data suggest that between 19% and 29% of teachers experienced clinically significant distress at each time-point. Conclusions: We detected high and sustained levels of psychological distress among primary school teachers, which suggests an urgent need for intervention. Effective support for teachers' mental health is particularly important given the potential impact of poor teacher mental health on pupil well-being, pupil attainment and teacher-pupil relationships.

649,G,"Objectives: The public and patients are primary contributors and beneficiaries of pandemic-relevant clinical research. However, their views on research participation during a pandemic have not been systematically studied. We aimed to understand public views regarding participation in clinical research during a hypothetical influenza pandemic. Study design: This is an international cross-sectional survey. Methods: We surveyed the views of nationally representative samples of people in Belgium, Poland, Spain, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, using a scenario-based instrument during the 2017 regional influenza season. Descriptive and regression analyses were conducted. Results: Of the 6804 respondents, 5572 (81.8%) thought pandemic-relevant research was important, and 5089 (74.8%) thought 'special rules' should be applied to make this research feasible. The respondents indicated willingness to take part in lower risk (4715, 69.3%) and higher risk (3585, 52.7%) primary care and lower risk (4780, 70.3%) and higher risk (4113, 60.4%) intensive care unit (ICU) study scenarios. For primary care studies, most (3972, 58.4%) participants preferred standard enrolment procedures such as prospective written informed consent, but 2327 (34.2%) thought simplified procedures would be acceptable. For ICU studies, 2800 (41.2%) preferred deferred consent, and 2623 (38.6%) preferred prospective third-party consent. Greater knowledge about pandemics, trust in a health professional, trust in the government, therapeutic misconception and having had ICU experience as a patient or carer predicted increased willingness to participate in pandemic-relevant research. Conclusions: Our study indicates current public support for pandemic-relevant clinical research. Tailored information and initiatives to advance research literacy and maintain trust are required to support pandemic-relevant research participation and engagement.

651,G,"Objectives: Suicide is an ongoing public health problem in the United States. The purpose of this epidemiologic investigation was to characterize and identify populations at risk of suicide, which in turn may lead to targeted intervention and improvements in suicide prevention. Study design: This is a descriptive analysis of 657 suicide decedents autopsied by the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics between 7/1/2003 and 6/30/2018 (180 months, 15 years). Methods: Data were obtained via autopsy report abstraction. Chi-squared tests were used for categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used for continuous variables. Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS 9.3. Results: Decedents were primarily white (88.2%) and male (75.7%). Average age was 43 years. Suicides were more likely to occur at a residence (69.3%), earlier in the week, and in the late night to early morning hours. Suicides were most likely to occur in spring and least likely to occur in winter. The most common method was a firearm (44.6%), most often a handgun (61.3% of firearm suicides). Less than one-half (42.8%) of decedents communicated intent to end their life. Approximately one-quarter (22.1%) of suicides were without a known identified life stressor or a known inciting event, a phenomenon that was markedly more common among men. Conclusions: More than one-half of decedents left no communication of intent to commit suicide, and one-quarter-more commonly men-had no known life stressor or other specifically identified motivating factor. While women were more likely to have a known mental health condition, prior contact with mental health care, or prior suicidal behavior, we found that, statistically speaking, the typical profile of a completed suicide is a white male who used a firearm in his place of residence. Future studies should seek to further elucidate factors leading to suicide in this at-risk population. (C) 2019 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
652,G,"Objectives: The goal of the present work is to investigate trends among US counties and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) growth rates in relation to the existence of shelter-in-place (SIP) orders in that county. Study design: This is a prospective cohort study. Methods: Compound growth rates were calculated using cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases from January 21, 2020, to March 31, 2020, in all 3139 US counties. Compound growth was chosen as it gives a single number that can be used in machine learning to represent the speed of virus spread during defined time intervals. Statistical analyses and a random forest machine learning model were used to analyze the data for differences in counties with and without SIP orders. Results: Statistical analyses revealed that the March 16 presidential recommendation (limiting gatherings to <10 people) lowered the compound growth rate of COVID-19 for all counties in the US by 6.6%, and the counties that implemented SIP after March 16 had a further reduction of 7.8% compared with the counties that did not implement SIP after March 16. A random forest machine learning model was built to predict compound growth rate after a SIP order and was found to have an accuracy of 92.3%. The random forest found that population, longitude, and population per square mile were the most important features when predicting the effect of SIP. Conclusions: SIP orders were found to be effective at reducing the growth rate of COVID-19 cases in the US. Counties with a large population or a high population density were found to benefit the most from a SIP order. (C) 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

654,G,"Background: There is emerging evidence about characteristics that may increase the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality, but they are highly correlated. Methods: An ecological analysis was used to estimate associations between these variables and age-standardised COVID-19 mortality rates at the local authority level. Results: Ethnicity, population density and overweight/obesity were all found to have strong independent associations with COVID-19 mortality, at the local authority level. Discussion: This analysis provides some preliminary evidence about which variables are independently associated with COVID-19 mortality and suggests that others (deprivation and pollution) are not directly linked. It highlights the importance of multivariate analyses to understand the factors that increase vulnerability to COVID-19. (C) 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

655,G,"Objectives: Families are a transmission route for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) because of the close contact. Monitoring of the viral load will be a valuable method to reduce the optimal number of quarantine days, especially in presymptomatic and symptomatic carriers of their households. The traditional three-generation families living together are seen frequently in East Asia, including in Taiwan. Study design: We report on a family cluster with six individuals infected with coronavirus disease in Taiwan. Methods: The current public policy in Taiwan is quarantine for at least 14 days, based on the incubation period, or until the patient has tested negative three days in a row using the SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Details on the onset date of clinical symptoms, throat swab conversion, and course of disease were collected from medical records retrospectively. Results: In the household of this three-generation Taiwanese family, the infection rate was 60%. The ratio of males to females was 4:2, and the age range was 11-85 years. The prevalence of asymptomatic disease was 33.3% (2/6). The longest throat swab conversion time was 37 days, and the estimated course of disease from symptoms to first conversion of throat swab was 59 days. Conclusions: Large families, including three-generation families in a single dwelling, should be monitored when the index case is found. Presymptomatic and symptomatic family members could be quarantined for an appropriate duration which, in our experience, is 2 months. (C) 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health.

656,G,"Objectives: This study determined the rate of secondary infection among contacts of individuals with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hangzhou according to the type of contacts, the intensity of contacts, and their relationship with the index patient. Study design: This is a retrospective cohort study. Methods: The analysis used the data of 2994 contacts of 144 individuals with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The contacts were categorized according to the information source, type of contact, location, intensity of contact, and relationship with the index patient. Results: The incidence of infection differed significantly according to contact type. Of the contacts, 186 (6.2%) developed symptoms, and 71 (2.4%) had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The main symptoms were cough and fever. Compared with those who had brief contact with the index case, those who had dined with the index case had 2.6 times higher risk of acquiring infection; those who had shared transport with, had visited, or had contact with the index case in a medical institution had 3.6 times higher risk of acquiring infection; and household contacts had 41.7 times higher risk of acquiring infection. Family members had 31.6 times higher risk of acquiring infection than healthcare providers or other patients exposed to an index case. Conclusions: The form and frequency of contact are the main factors affecting the risk of infection among contacts of individuals with COVID-19. Centralized isolation and observation of close contacts of individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, in addition to population-based control measures, can reduce the risk of secondary infections and curb the spread of the infection.

657,G,"Objectives: The incidence of emerging coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease is variable across the different parts of the world. Apart from travel patterns, other factors determining this difference may include host immune response. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of tuberculosis (TB) endemicity and Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) coverage on COVID-19. Study design: This was a cross-sectional study. Methods: We reviewed available data regarding TB incidence, BCG coverage (as per the World Health Organization), and COVID-19 incidence of 174 countries. We divided the countries into four cohorts depending on annual TB incidence and BCG coverage. Results: Countries with high TB incidence had lower COVID-19 than countries with low TB incidence. Similarly, countries with high BCG coverage had lower incidence of COVID-19, suggesting some protective mechanisms in TB-endemic areas. However, the ecological differences and different testing strategies between countries could not be accounted for in this analysis. Conclusion: Higher TB incidence and BCG coverage were found to be associated with lesser incidence of COVID-19. This outcome paves the way for further research into pathogenesis and immune response in COVID-19. (C) 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
658,G,"Objectives: Socio-economic inequalities may affect coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) incidence. The goal of the research was to explore the association between deprivation of socio-economic status (SES) and spatial patterns of COVID-19 incidence in Chennai megacity for unfolding the disease epidemiology. Study design: This is an ecological (or contextual) study for electoral wards (subcities) of Chennai megacity. Methods: Using data of confirmed COVID-19 cases from May 15, 2020, to May 21, 2020, for 155 electoral wards obtained from the official website of the Chennai Municipal Corporation, we examined the incidence of COVID-19 using two count regression models, namely, Poisson regression (PR) and negative binomial regression (NBR). As explanatory factors, we considered area deprivation that represented the deprivation of SES. An index of multiple deprivations (IMD) was developed to measure the area deprivation using an advanced local statistic, geographically weighted principal component analysis. Based on the availability of appropriately scaled data, five domains (i.e., poor housing condition, low asset possession, poor availability of WaSH services, lack of household amenities and services, and gender disparity) were selected as components of the IMD in this study. Results: The hot spot analysis revealed that area deprivation was significantly associated with higher incidences of COVID-19 in Chennai megacity. The high variations (adjusted R-2: 72.2%) with the lower Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) (124.34) and Akaike's Information Criteria (AIC) (112.12) for NBR compared with PR suggests that the NBR model better explains the relationship between area deprivation and COVID-19 incidences in Chennai megacity. NBR with two-sided tests and P <0.05 were considered statistically significant. The outcome of the PR and NBR models suggests that when all other variables were constant, according to NBR, the relative risk (RR) of COVID-19 incidences was 2.19 for the wards with high housing deprivation or, in other words, the wards with high housing deprivation having 119% higher probability (RR = (e0.786) = 2.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.98 to 2.40), compared with areas with low deprivation. Similarly, in the wards with poor availability of WaSH services, chances of having COVID-19 incidence was 90% higher than in the wards with good WaSH services (RR = (0.642) =1.90, 95% CI = 1.79 to 2.00). Spatial risks of COVID-19 were predominantly concentrated in the wards with higher levels of area deprivation, which were mostly located in the northeastern parts of Chennai megacity. Conclusions: We formulated an area-based IMD, which was substantially related to COVID-19 incidences in Chennai megacity. This study highlights that the risks of COVID-19 tend to be higher in areas with low SES and that the northeastern part of Chennai megacity is predominantly high-risk areas. Our results can guide measures of COVID-19 control and prevention by considering spatial risks and area deprivation. (C) 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

SARS-CoV-2 emerging from Wuhan, China, took only three months to cover >200 countries worldwide by infecting more than 2.4 million people and killing more than 150,000 people. Although this infection at the early stage creates seasonal flu-like symptoms with a higher illness, it eventually causes a higher mortality. Epidemiological studies not only find the causes of many health issues but also suggest preventive measures. This study aimed to see the link between environment temperature and COVID-19 cases. Study design: The monthly average environment temperature (MAET) and various COVID-19 cases of a country were collected and analyzed to see the relationship between these parameters. Methods: Univariate analysis and statistical modeling were used to determine the relationship between environment temperature and different COVID-19 cases. Results: This study found that the majorities of the countries having higher COVID-19 cases are located in the higher latitude (colder region) in the globe. As of 20th April data available, statistical analyses by various methods have found that strong negative correlations with statistical significance exist between MAET and several COVID-19 cases including total cases, active cases, and cases per million of a country (Spearman correlation coefficients were 0.45, 0.42, and 0.50 for total cases, active cases, and cases/per million, respectively). Analysis by the statistical log-linear regression model further supports that the chance of patients to contract COVID-19 is less in warmer countries than in colder countries. Conclusion: This pilot study proposes that cold environment may be an additional risk factor for COVID19 cases. (C) 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

660,G,"Objectives: This study explored the factors influencing health behaviours during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China. The impact of perceived stress and positive perception of interventions on health behaviours in China were assessed using the extended information-motivation-behaviour skills (IMB) model. Study design: Cross-sectional survey. Methods: The Questionstar online survey tool was used to construct a structured questionnaire based on the IMB model. Between 14 and 22 February 2020, during the peak of COVID-19 epidemic in China, 2449 participants were recruited by snowball sampling on WeChat and Tencent QQ social media platforms in China. Data were collected through an online questionnaire, and structural equation modelling was performed to evaluate the extended IMB model. Results: Health behaviours were assessed using a scoring system (total score range: 8-40); the average health behaviour score in this study was 34.62 4.44. The term 'health risk stress' refers to the impact that perceived stress has on health, and this was experienced by 39.9% of participants. Only 35.9% of participants answered all seven questions on COVID-19 information correctly. The final model showed that information, motivation, behavioural skills, heath risk stress and positive perception of interventions had significant direct effects on health behaviours. Health behaviours were positively associated with the positive perception of interventions but negatively associated with health risk stress. Behavioural skills had the greatest impact on health behaviours. Conclusions: In the face of public health emergencies, the extended IMB model has been used as a theoretical framework to construct more effective interventions. The government should pay attention to publicity and guidance, strengthen positive interactions with the public and disclose relevant information in a timely manner to gain trust and to maintain the positive public perception of the interventions. In terms of health education, the government should focus on behavioural skills, promptly rectify ineffective prevention information and raise awareness about the disease to relieve stress and anxiety in the population.

661,G,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody tests of varying specificity and sensitivity are now available. For informing individuals whether they have had coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), they need to be very accurate. For measuring population prevalence of past infection, the numbers of false positives and negatives need to be roughly equal. With a series of worked examples for a notional population of 100,000 people, we show that even test systems with a high specificity can yield a large number of false positive results, especially where the population prevalence is low. For example, at a true population prevalence of 5%, using a test with 99% sensitivity and specificity, 16% of positive results will be false and thus 950 people will be incorrectly informed they have had the infection. Further confirmatory testing may be needed. Giving false reassurance on which personal or societal decisions might be based could be harmful for individuals, undermine public confidence and foster further outbreaks.

662,G,"Objective: Psychosocial factors, such as environmental stressors, can increase the risk of hypertension. This study examines the role of the household environment in hypertension outcomes by assessing the link between female hypertension status and spousal alcohol consumption in Nepal. Study design: This is a cross-sectional study. Methods: We used the 2016 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey to assess differences in hypertension outcomes in women aged 15 to 49 years whose husbands drink alcohol and in those whose husbands do not. We estimated a multinomial logistic model to obtain adjusted differences in the likelihood of being hypertensive between the two groups. We also examined several socio-economic conditions across the two groups to discuss various aspects of the association. Results: After controlling for anthropometric and various sociodemographic attributes, we find that women whose husbands drink alcohol were 2.5 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.31, 5.31) more likely to be hypertensive than women whose husbands do not. They were also more likely to experience food insecurity, to experience spousal violence, and to consume tobacco products. Among women whose husbands became intoxicated ('got drunk') very often, the likelihood of being hypertensive was 4.0 percentage points (95% CI: 0.26, 7.67) higher than among women whose husbands do not drink alcohol. Conclusion: Women whose husbands consume alcohol have an elevated risk of being hypertensive, illustrating the association between hypertension and the household environment. The findings document the added hypertension burden in socially vulnerable population groups and can inform initiatives to reduce alcohol consumption in Nepal.

663,G,"Background: On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak as a pandemic. The first cases in Italy were reported on January 30, 2020, and the outbreak quickly escalated. On March 19, 2020, deaths in Italy surpassed those in China. The Italian government implemented progressively restrictive measures leading to a nationwide lockdown on March 8, 2020. This study aimed to assess the impact of mitigation measures implemented in Italy on the spread of COVID-19. Methods: Publicly available data were used to evaluate changes in the growth curve of the number of patients hospitalized in intensive care (IC) at three time intervals between February 19, 2020, and April 9, 2020, after the implementation of progressive measures: (1) containment and travel restrictions, (2) lockdown of the epicenter of the outbreak, and (3) school closures and nationwide lockdown. The models that showed the highest reliability according to the Akaike information criterion and based on data from the three time intervals were projected to assess how the epidemic would have evolved if no other measure had been implemented. Results: The most reliable models were (1) exponential, (2) quadratic, and (3) cubic (R-2 = 0.99, >0.99, and > 0.99 respectively), indicating a progressive decrease in the growth of the curve. Conclusion: This study suggests the measures were effective in flattening the epidemic curve and bought valuable time, allowing for the number of IC beds to be nearly doubled before the national health system reached maximum capacity.

664,G,"Objectives: Previous studies have shown the beneficial impacts of arts participation and cultural engagement on health outcomes. However, this engagement is socially patterned and is also possibly influenced by geographical factors. Study design: The aim of this study was to examine the association between geographical factors (spatial setting and neighbourhood characteristics) and arts and cultural engagement amongst adults in the UK. Methods: Data analysed were from Understanding Society Wave 2 (2010/12) with a total sample size of 26,215. Logistic and ordinal regression was used to identify geographical predictors for the patterns of the engagement. Results: Our results show that there are geographical differences in participation independent of individual demographic and socio-economic backgrounds. In particular, there was more evidence for differences in the participation based on neighbourhood characteristics (e.g. level of area deprivation). We also found some interactions between individual and geographical factors for cultural engagement but not for arts participation. Conclusions: This study reveals a geographical and individual socio-economic gradient in arts and cultural engagement. Given the health benefits of arts engagement, improving access to arts and cultural programmes geographically may potentially help to reduce health inequalities. (C) 2020 The Authors.

665,G,"Objectives: In 2017, one in four French 17-year-olds was a daily smoker, even though France prohibited the sale of tobacco to under-18 minors in 2009. This research aims to evaluate the retail violation rate for sale to minors (RVRms) and the associated factors. Study design: The study design used is observational mystery shopping study. Methods: We conducted a mystery shopping study enlisting 12-year-old and 17-year-old youths in a representative sample of 527 tobacco outlets during three weeks in spring 2019. Multinomial Logit and Probit regressions were estimated on the data collected. Results: The law is not respected. Two of three sellers (65.2%) were willing to make an illegal sale to a 17 year-old minor, and almost one in 12 (8.1%) were willing to sell to a 12-year-old child attempting to buy tobacco. Illegal sales were more likely to be made by male sellers, retailing in big cities, when there were no in-shop queues, and to 17-year-old females. The absence of the mandatory enforcement poster flagging up the ban on the sale of tobacco to minors appears to be a strong factor associated with RVRm. Conclusions: These findings show that progress needs to be made to better enforce tobacco control legislation to help decrease underage smoking in France. Rate of compliance with the law could be improved by stronger enforcement measures and tougher sanctions, but also by training and the provision of age-verification tools for sellers, as demonstrated by experiments in other countries.

666,C,"The complete latitudinal coverage of Saturn's thermospheric temperatures from Cassini Grand Finale data shows a more uniform spatial behaviour than model predictions, indicating an efficient redistribution of auroral energy from the poles towards the equator that could contribute to solving the giant planet's energy crisis puzzle. Temperatures of the outer planet thermospheres exceed those predicted by solar heating alone by several hundred degrees. Enough energy is deposited at auroral regions to heat the entire thermosphere, but models predict that equatorward distribution is inhibited by strong Coriolis forces and ion drag(1,2). A better understanding of auroral energy deposition and circulation are critical to solving this so-called energy crisis. Stellar occultations observed by the Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph instrument during the Cassini Grand Finale were designed to map the thermosphere from pole to pole. We analyse these observations, together with earlier observations from 2016 and 2017, to create a two-dimensional map of densities and temperatures in Saturn's thermosphere as a function of latitude and depth. The observed temperatures at auroral latitudes are cooler and peak at higher altitudes and lower latitudes than predicted by models, leading to a shallower meridional pressure gradient. Under modified geostrophy(3), we infer slower westward zonal winds that extend to lower latitudes than predicted, supporting equatorward flow from approximately 70 degrees to 30 degrees latitude in both hemispheres. We also show evidence of atmospheric waves in the data that can contribute to equatorward redistribution of energy through zonal drag."
667,C,"While ancient scientists often had patrons to fund their work, peer review of proposals for the allocation of resources is a foundation of modern science. A very common method is that proposals are evaluated by a small panel of experts (due to logistics and funding limitations) nominated by the grant-giving institutions. The expert panel process introduces several issues, most notably the following: (1) biases may be introduced in the selection of the panel and (2) experts have to read a very large number of proposals. Distributed peer review promises to alleviate several of the described problems by distributing the task of reviewing among the proposers. Each proposer is given a limited number of proposals to review and rank. We present the result of an experiment running a machine-learning-enhanced distributed peer-review process for allocation of telescope time at the European Southern Observatory. In this work, we show that the distributed peer review is statistically the same as a 'traditional' panel, that our machine-learning algorithm can predict expertise of reviewers with a high success rate, and that seniority and reviewer expertise have an influence on review quality. The general experience has been overwhelmingly praised by the participating community (using an anonymous feedback mechanism). The European Southern Observatory trialled a distributed peer-review system-augmented by automated reviewer assignment-for its telescope time allocation process, finding that it worked as well as the standard process but resulted in a smaller burden on reviewers."
668,C,"The first discovered interstellar object (ISO), 'Oumuamua (1I/2017 U1) shows a dry and rocky surface, an unusually elongated shape, with short-to-long axis ratio c/a less than or similar to 1/6, a low velocity relative to the local standard of rest (similar to 10 km s(-1)), non-gravitational accelerations and tumbles on a timescale of a few hours(1-9). The inferred number density (similar to 3.5 x 10(13)-2 x 10(15) pc(-3)) for a population of asteroidal ISOs10,11 outnumbers cometary ISOs12 by >= 10(3), in contrast to the much lower ratio (less than or similar to 10(-2)) of rocky/icy Kuiper belt objects(13). Although some scenarios can cause the ejection of asteroidal ISOs14,15, a unified formation theory has yet to comprehensively link all 'Oumuamua's puzzling characteristics and to account for the population. Here we show by numerical simulations that 'Oumuamua-like ISOs can be prolifically produced through extensive tidal fragmentation and ejected during close encounters of their volatile-rich parent bodies with their host stars. Material strength enhanced by the intensive heating during periastron passages enables the emergence of extremely elongated triaxial ISOs with shape c/a less than or similar to 1/10, sizes a approximate to 100 m and rocky surfaces. Although volatiles with low sublimation temperature (such as CO) are concurrently depleted, H2O buried under surfaces is preserved in these ISOs, providing an outgassing source without measurable cometary activities for 'Oumuamua's non-gravitational accelerations during its passage through the inner Solar System. We infer that the progenitors of 'Oumuamua-like ISOs may be kilometre-sized long-period comets from Oort clouds, kilometre-sized residual planetesimals from debris disks or planet-sized bodies at a few astronomical units, orbiting around low-mass main-sequence stars or white dwarfs. These provide abundant reservoirs to account for 'Oumuamua's occurrence rate."
669,C,"Methane is one of the simplest stable molecules that is both abundant and widely distributed across space. Observational surveys of CH4 ice towards low- and high-mass young stellar objects showed that much of the CH4 is expected to be formed by the hydrogenation of C on dust grains, and that CH4 ice is strongly correlated with solid H2O. However, this has not been investigated under controlled laboratory conditions. Here, we successfully demonstrate with a C-atom beam implemented in an ultrahigh vacuum apparatus the formation of CH4 ice in two separate co-deposition experiments: C + H on a 10 K surface to mimic CH4 formation directly before H2O ice is formed on the dust grain, and C + H + H2O on a 10 K surface to mimic CH4 formed simultaneously with H2O ice. We confirm that CH4 can be formed by the reaction of atomic C and H, and that the CH4 formation rate is twice as high when CH4 is formed within a H2O-rich ice. This is in agreement with the observational finding that interstellar CH4 and H2O form together in the polar ice phase. The conditions that lead to interstellar CH4 (and CD4) ice formation are reported, and can be incorporated into astrochemical models to further constrain CH4 chemistry in the interstellar medium and in other regions where CH4 is inherited. Methane ice has been presumed to form via the sequential hydrogenation of carbon atoms on dust grains for many years, but now Qasim et al. have performed the experiment, with and without the presence of water. Methane forms more rapidly in the polar ice phase."
670,C,"Classical novae are thermonuclear explosions that occur on the surfaces of white dwarf stars in interacting binary systems(1). It has long been thought that the luminosity of classical novae is powered by continued nuclear burning on the surface of the white dwarf after the initial runaway(2). However, recent observations of gigaelectronvolt gamma-rays from classical novae have hinted that shocks internal to the nova ejecta may dominate the nova emission. Shocks have also been suggested to power the luminosity of events as diverse as stellar mergers(3), supernovae(4) and tidal disruption events(5), but observational confirmation has been lacking. Here we report simultaneous space-based optical and gamma-ray observations of the 2018 nova V906 Carinae (ASASSN-18fv), revealing a remarkable series of distinct correlated flares in both bands. The optical and gamma-ray flares occur simultaneously, implying a common origin in shocks. During the flares, the nova luminosity doubles, implying that the bulk of the luminosity is shock powered. Furthermore, we detect concurrent but weak X-ray emission from deeply embedded shocks, confirming that the shock power does not appear in the X-ray band and supporting its emergence at longer wavelengths. Our data, spanning the spectrum from radio to gamma-ray, provide direct evidence that shocks can power substantial luminosity in classical novae and other optical transients. Simultaneous optical and gamma-ray observations of nova V906 Carinae reveal correlated flares in both wavelength ranges that can be linked to shocks in the nova ejecta. Weak X-ray emission suggests that the shocks are deeply embedded, but they contribute substantially to the luminosity of the nova."
671,C,"An angular extension at gamma-ray energies of 52 arcseconds is detected for the Crab nebula, revealing the emission region of the highest-energy gamma rays; simulations of the electromagnetic emission provide a non-trivial test of our understanding of particle acceleration in the Crab nebula. The Crab nebula is one of the most-studied cosmic particle accelerators, shining brightly across the entire electromagnetic spectrum up to very-high-energy gamma rays(1,2). It is known from observations in the radio to gamma-ray part of the spectrum that the nebula is powered by a pulsar, which converts most of its rotational energy losses into a highly relativistic outflow. This outflow powers a pulsar wind nebula, a region of up to ten light-years across, filled with relativistic electrons and positrons. These particles emit synchrotron photons in the ambient magnetic field and produce very-high-energy gamma rays by Compton up-scattering of ambient low-energy photons. Although the synchrotron morphology of the nebula is well established, it has not been known from which region the very-high-energy gamma rays are emitted(3-8). Here we report that the Crab nebula has an angular extension at gamma-ray energies of 52 arcseconds (assuming a Gaussian source width), much larger than at X-ray energies. This result closes a gap in the multi-wavelength coverage of the nebula, revealing the emission region of the highest-energy gamma rays. These gamma rays enable us to probe a previously inaccessible electron and positron energy range. We find that simulations of the electromagnetic emission reproduce our measurement, providing a non-trivial test of our understanding of particle acceleration in the Crab nebula."
672,C,"Rocky asteroids and planets display nucleosynthetic isotope variations that are attributed to the heterogeneous distribution of stardust from different stellar sources in the solar protoplanetary disk. Here we report new high-precision palladium isotope data for six iron meteorite groups. The palladium data display smaller nucleosynthetic isotope variations than the more refractory neighbouring elements. Based on this observation, we present a model in which thermal destruction of interstellar dust in the inner Solar System results in an enrichment of s-process-dominated stardust in regions closer to the Sun. We propose that stardust is depleted in volatile elements due to incomplete condensation of these elements into dust around asymptotic giant branch stars. This led to the smaller nucleosynthetic variations for Pd reported here and the lack of such variations for more volatile elements. The smaller magnitude variations measured in heavier refractory elements suggest that material from high-metallicity asymptotic giant branch stars is the dominant source of stardust in the Solar System. These stars produce fewer heavy s-process elements (proton number Z >= 56) compared with the bulk Solar System composition."
673,C,"Massive dwarf galaxies that merge with the Milky Way on prograde orbits can be dragged into the disk plane before being completely disrupted. Such mergers can contribute to an accreted stellar disk and a dark matter disk. Here we present Nyx, a vast stellar stream in the vicinity of the Sun, which provides the first indication that such an event occurred in the Milky Way. We identify about 200 stars that have coherent radial and prograde motion in this stream using a catalogue of accreted stars built by applying deep learning methods to the Gaia data. Taken together with chemical abundance and orbital information, these results strongly favour the interpretation that Nyx is the remnant of a disrupted dwarf galaxy. Further justified by FIRE hydrodynamic simulations, we demonstrate that prograde streams like Nyx can be found in the disk plane of galaxies and identified using our methods. Analysis of a catalogue of accreted stars by their radial and prograde motions has identified a 200-plus-member coherent stellar stream (called Nyx) that is likely to be the remnant of a dwarf galaxy that merged with the Milky Way."
674,C,"The vast majority of stars with mass similar to that of the Sun are expected to destroy lithium (Li) gradually over the course of their lives, via low-temperature nuclear burning. This has now been supported by observations of hundreds of thousands of red giant stars(1-5). Here we perform a large-scale systematic investigation into the Li content of stars in the red clump phase of evolution, which directly follows the red giant branch phase. Surprisingly, we find that all red clump stars have high levels of Li for their evolutionary stage, with an increase of a factor of 40 over the end of the red giant branch stage, on average. This suggests that all low-mass stars undergo an Li production phase between the tip of the red giant branch and the red clump. We demonstrate that our finding is not predicted by stellar theory, revealing a stark tension between observations and models. We also show that the well-studied(1,2,4-6)very Li-rich giants, withA(Li) > +1.5 dex, represent only the extreme tail of the Li enhancement distribution, comprising 3% of red clump stars. Our findings suggest a new definition limit for Li-richness in red clump stars,A(Li) > -0.9 dex, which is much lower than the limit ofA(Li) > +1.5 dex used over many decades(1,5-9). Low-mass stars are expected to destroy their lithium content as they evolve, but this study of stars in the red clump evolutionary stage shows that their lithium abundance is on average forty times greater than at the end of the previous stage, something not predicted by theory."
675,C,"Accurately constraining the formation and evolution of the lunar magnesian suite is key to understanding the earliest periods of magmatic crustal building that followed accretion and primordial differentiation of the Moon. However, the origin and evolution of these unique rocks is highly debated. Here, we report on the microstructural characterization of a large (250-mu m) baddeleyite (monoclinic-ZrO2) grain in Apollo troctolite 76535 that preserves quantifiable crystallographic relationships indicative of reversion from a precursor cubic-ZrO2 phase. This observation places important constraints on the formation temperature of the grain (>2,300 degrees C), which endogenic processes alone fail to reconcile. We conclude that the troctolite crystallized directly from a large, differentiated impact melt sheet 4,328 +/- 8 Myr ago. These results suggest that impact bombardment would have played a critical role in the evolution of the earliest planetary crusts."
676,C,"Special Regions on Mars are defined as environments able to host liquid water that simultaneously meets certain temperature and water activity requirements that allow known terrestrial organisms to replicate(1,2) and therefore could be habitable. Such regions would be of concern for planetary protection policies owing to the potential for forward contamination (biological contamination from Earth). Pure liquid water is unstable on the Martian surface(3,4) but brines may be present(3,5). Experimental work has shown that brines persist beyond their predicted stability region, leading to metastable liquids(6-8). Here we show that (meta)stable brines can form and persist from the equator to high latitudes on the surface of Mars for a few percent of the year for up to six consecutive hours, a broader range than previously thought(9,10). However, only the lowest eutectic solutions can form, leading to brines with temperatures of less than 225 K. Our results indicate that (meta)stable brines on the Martian surface and its shallow subsurface (a few centimetres deep) are not habitable because their water activities and temperatures fall outside the known tolerances for terrestrial life. Furthermore, (meta)stable brines do not meet the Special Region requirements, reducing the risk of forward contamination and easing threats related to the exploration of the Martian surface."
677,C,"Simulations show that turbulent heating at the solar surface randomly evaporates material to the corona, naturally reproducing the formation of long, fibril-like threads within solar filaments in the solar corona and their counterstreamings. Solar filaments, also called solar prominences when appearing above the solar limb, are cold, dense materials suspended in the hot tenuous solar corona, consisting of numerous long, fibril-like threads. These threads are the key to disclosing the physics of solar filaments. Similar structures also exist in galaxy clusters. Besides their mysterious formation, filament threads are observed to move with alternating directions, which are called counterstreaming flows. However, the origin of these flows has not been clarified yet. Here we report that turbulent heating at the solar surface is the key, which randomly evaporates materials from the solar surface to the corona, naturally reproducing the formation and counterstreamings of the sparse threads in the solar corona. We further suggest that while the cold H alpha counterstreamings are mainly due to longitudinal oscillations of the filament threads, there are million-kelvin counterstreamings in the corona between threads, which are alternating unidirectional flows."
678,C,"Magnetohydrodynamic turbulence is a ubiquitous and fundamental ingredient underlying many astrophysical phenomena. The multiphase nature of the interstellar medium and the diversity of driving mechanisms give rise to spatial variation of turbulence properties, particularly plasma properties. There has been no observational diagnosis of the plasma modes beyond the solar system so far. Here we report the identification of different plasma modes in various Galactic environments, including active star-forming zones and supernova remnants, on the basis of our synchrotron polarization analysis. The observed high degree of consistency between the gamma-ray excess in the Cygnus cocoon and the location of magnetosonic modes provides strong observational evidence for the long-advocated theory that magnetosonic modes dominate the cosmic ray (CR) scattering and acceleration. Our results open up a new avenue for the study of interstellar turbulence and demonstrate the indispensability of accounting for their plasma properties in all the relevant processes, including CR transport and star formation. Different plasma modes in various Galactic environments are identified on the basis of a synchrotron polarization analysis. These results open up the study of interstellar turbulence and demonstrate its importance in all relevant processes including cosmic ray transport and star formation."
679,C,"Early-type galaxies are considered to be the end products of massive galaxy formation(1). Optical spectroscopic studies reveal that massive early-type galaxies formed the bulk of their stars over short timescales (less than or similar to 1 Gyr) and at high red-shift (z greater than or similar to 2), followed by passive evolution to the present(2). However, their optical spectra are unable to constrain small episodes of recent star formation, since they are dominated by old stars. Fortunately, this problem can be tackled in the ultraviolet range. While recent studies that make use of ultraviolet absorption lines have suggested the presence of young stars in a few early-type galaxies(3), the age and mass fractions of young stars and their dependence on galaxy mass are unknown. Here we report a detailed study of these young stellar populations, from high-quality stacked spectra of 28,663 galaxies from the BOSS survey(4), analysing optical and ultraviolet absorption lines simultaneously. We find that residual star formation is ubiquitous in massive early-type galaxies, measuring average mass fractions of 0.5% in young stars in the last 2 Gyr of their evolution. This fraction shows a decreasing trend with galaxy stellar mass, consistent with a downsizing scenario(5). We also find that synthetic galaxies from state-of-the-art cosmological numerical simulations(6) substantially overproduce both intermediate and young stellar populations. Therefore, our results pose stringent constraints on numerical simulations of galaxy formation(6,7)."
680,C,"Stellar intensity interferometry (SII) is undergoing a revival. Here, data from the four 12 m optical reflectors of the VERITAS array are correlated post facto to determine the angular diameter of two stars to a high precision, laying the groundwork for SII at future large Cherenkov arrays. High angular resolution observations at optical wavelengths provide valuable insights into stellar astrophysics(1,2), and enable direct measurements of fundamental stellar parameters(3,4)and the probing of stellar atmospheres, circumstellar disks(5), the elongation of rapidly rotating stars(6)and the pulsations of Cepheid variable stars(7). The angular size of most stars is of the order of one milliarcsecond or less, and to spatially resolve stellar disks and features at this scale requires an optical interferometer using an array of telescopes with baselines on the order of hundreds of metres. We report on the implementation of a stellar intensity interferometry system developed for the four VERITAS imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. The system was used to measure the angular diameter of the two sub-milliarcsecond stars beta Canis Majoris and epsilon Orionis with a precision of greater than 5%. The system uses an offline approach in which starlight intensity fluctuations that are recorded at each telescope are correlated post observation. The technique can be readily scaled onto tens to hundreds of telescopes, providing a capability that has proven technically challenging to the current generation of optical amplitude interferometry observatories. This work demonstrates the feasibility of performing astrophysical measurements using imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope arrays as intensity interferometers and shows the promise for integrating an intensity interferometry system within future observatories such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array."
681,C,"Most stars in the Galactic nuclear disk formed at least 8 Gyr ago, with a starburst event about 1 Gyr ago that formed roughly 5% of its mass. This long quiescence has implications on when the Galactic bar was formed and its gas transport efficiency. The nuclear disk is a dense stellar structure at the centre of the Milky Way, with a radius of ~150 pc (ref. (1)). It has been a place of intense star formation in the past several tens of millions of years(1-3), but its overall formation history has remained unknown(2). Here, we report that the bulk of its stars formed at least 8 Gyr ago. After a long period of quiescence, a starburst event followed about 1 Gyr ago that formed roughly 5% of its mass within ~100 Myr, in what may arguably have been one of the most energetic events in the history of the Milky Way. Star formation continued subsequently on a lower level, creating a few per cent of the stellar mass in the past ~500 Myr, with an increased rate up to ~30 Myr ago. Our findings contradict the previously accepted paradigm of quasi-continuous star formation at the Galactic Centre(4). The long quiescent phase agrees with the overall quiescent history of the Milky Way(2,5) and suggests that our Galaxy's bar may not have existed until recently, or that gas transport through the bar was extremely inefficient during a long stretch of the Milky Way's life. Consequently, the central black hole may have acquired most of its mass already in the early days of the Milky Way."

Unusually for a WTO dispute, the Panel (chaired by former WTO Appellate Body Member Georges Abi-Saab) found that Russia had not acted inconsistently with any of the claimed obligations under the GATT or Russia's Accession Protocol. Central to that conclusion was the Panel's understanding of the GATT security exception and the circumstances surrounding the imposition of the challenged measures, which related to trade in transit by road and rail through Russian territory. The Panel found that, since 2014, an emergency in international relations existed between Russia and Ukraine within the meaning of GATT Article XXI(b)(iii) and that the challenged measures fell within this exception. If the exception had not applied, according to the Panel, Ukraine would have established a prima facie case of violation of the provisions on freedom of transit in GATT Article V:2 and equivalent provisions in Russia's Accession Protocol. The decision, which neither party chose to appeal, has significant implications for other disputes in which the security exception has been invoked."
685,B,"In 2009, the International Criminal Court (ICC) stepped into uncharted waters as it issued its first arrest warrant for a sitting head of state, then President of Sudan Omar Al-Bashir. Following the UN Security Council's referral of the situation in the Darfur region of Sudan to the ICC, Al-Bashir was charged by the Court with war crimes and crimes against humanity, and in 2010, he was also charged with genocide. As a consequence, all of the states parties to the Rome Statute had a duty to arrest Al-Bashir. Several states have nonetheless failed to arrest him during country visits, allowing Al-Bashir to evade the ICC. This has given rise to a number of cases before the ICC Chambers, including this Appeals Chamber judgment regarding the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan."
686,B,"In Vedanta v. Lungowe, the United Kingdom Supreme Court determined that civil claims for negligence brought by Zambian claimants against an English parent company (Vedanta) and its Zambian subsidiary (Konkola Copper Mines plc (KCM)) for damages experienced in Zambia can proceed in English courts. While framed as a domestic tort law case, the decision is significant for international efforts aimed at holding businesses accountable for their """"negative impacts"""" on human rights. Writing for a unanimous Court, Lord Briggs's judgment hinged narrowly on the right of victims to access substantial justice. More broadly, Lord Briggs suggested that parent companies that hold themselves out in public disclosures as overseeing the human rights, environmental, social, or labor standards employed by their subsidiaries assume a duty of care to those harmed by the subsidiary. This suggestion has the potential to transform current corporate approaches to human rights due diligence and accountability."
687,B,"As a disciplinarian of international organizations, reputation has serious shortcomings. Even though international organizations have strong incentives to maintain a good reputation, reputational concerns will sometimes fail to spur preventive or corrective action. Organizations have multiple audiences, so efforts to preserve a """"good"""" reputation may pull organizations in many different directions, and steps taken to preserve a good reputation will not always be salutary. Recent incidents of sexual violence by UN peacekeepers in the Central African Republic illustrate these points."
688,B,"Since the conclusion of the Paris Agreement, climate litigation has become a global phenomenon, casting courts as important players in multilevel climate governance. However, most climate litigation scholarship focuses on court actions in the Global North. This Article is the first to shine a light on the Global South's contribution to transnational climate litigation. Analysis of this experience is essential if transnational climate jurisprudence is to contribute meaningfully to global climate governance, and to ensuring just outcomes for the most climate-vulnerable."
689,B,"Decolonization and its quite valid discontents lay at the center of this advisory opinion regarding the territory and populations of islands located in the Indian Ocean. Answering questions posed by the UN General Assembly, the International Court of Justice (ICJ or Court) concluded that because the Chagos Archipelago was detached from Mauritius as a condition of independence, the decolonization of Mauritius had not been completed in accordance with international law. The Court further ruled unlawful the United Kingdom's continued administration of the Chagos Archipelago and called upon all UN member states to aid completion of the decolonization process. Nearly unanimous-the sole dissenter on the merits was Judge Joan E. Donoghue of the United States-the advisory opinion contained significant pronouncements on decolonization, on the right of all peoples to self-determination, and on the formation of customary rules respecting both. It did so in a manner that implicated the ICJ's role as the judicial organ of the United Nations, in whose General Assembly and other political bodies the next episodes in the Chagos controversy seem destined to unfold."
690,B,"On April 8, 2016, the Egyptian government announced the signing of a """"Convention of Demarcation of the Maritime Border"""" with Saudi Arabia (Convention). Under the Convention, the Red Sea Islands of Tiran and Sanafir lay in Saudi territory. The move was perceived by foreign and domestic observers as the abandonment by Egypt of a long-held territorial and maritime claim in exchange for a loan from Saudi Arabia, and it was challenged before the Egyptian courts. On January 16, 2017, the Egyptian Supreme Administrative Court rendered a judgment annulling the act of cession of the islands on the basis of the Egyptian people's entitlement over them (Judgment). The Judgment triggered a domestic judicial saga, which only ended in 2018. Aside from the intriguing political dimensions of this incident, the Judgment, while interpreting the Egyptian Constitution of 2014, sheds light on some fundamental aspects of international law, namely: the identity of the """"holder"""" of sovereignty and its relations with the """"delegatee,"""" i.e., the government; the contribution of human rights as an analytical frame for this issue; and the validity of a treaty concluded in violation of a state's treaty-making powers, a question for which there is limited practice."
691,B,"The CJEU held that the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK) is allowed to unilaterally revoke the notification of its intention to withdraw from the European Union (EU) as long as the revocation is submitted in writing to the European Council before the UK's withdrawal takes effect, and as long as the revocation is """"unequivocal and unconditional, that is to say that the purpose of that revocation is to confirm the EU membership of the member state concerned under terms that are unchanged as regards its status as a member state, and that revocation brings the withdrawal procedure to an end"""" (para. 74)."
692,B,"In Jam v. International Finance Corp., the U.S. Supreme Court held that the International Organizations Immunities Act of 1945 (IOIA) affords international organizations (IOs) the same immunity from suit in U.S. courts that foreign governments currently enjoy under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA), which codifies the restrictive theory of foreign sovereign immunity. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) had argued that the IOIA, which grants international organizations the """"'same immunity' from suit horizontal ellipsis 'as is enjoyed by foreign governments'"""" (p. 15), should be understood to provide international organizations with absolute immunity, which it argued foreign governments enjoyed prior to the United States' explicit adoption of the restrictive theory in 1952. Under the restrictive theory, a foreign state is immune from suit for its sovereign acts (acta jure imperii), but not for its commercial acts (acta jure gestionis). By interpreting language in the IOIA as granting the """"same immunity"""" to international organizations as foreign governments enjoy at the time the suit is filed, the Supreme Court aligned the regime for IO immunity with that of foreign state immunity, except in cases where the IO's founding charter provides a different rule or where the executive branch has explicitly limited immunity. It remains to be seen what IO activities are deemed """"commercial"""" under this regime and what types of transactions are found to have a sufficient nexus to the United States to fall within the FSIA's commercial-activity exception."
693,B,"With only three remaining members of what is supposed to be a seven-member body, the World Trade Organization's (WTO) Appellate Body may soon cease to function. Since 2016, the United States has blocked the reappointment of Appellate Body members and rejected over a dozen proposals to launch selection processes that could fill the remaining vacancies. As a lead reason for these blocks, the United States has cited concerns about the practice whereby members whose terms have expired continue to serve on appeals to which they were previously appointed. On December 10, 2019, the terms of two Appellate Body members will expire, leaving only one member remaining. Because the WTO's dispute settlement process requires three Appellate Body members for each appeal, WTO members will be unable to make any new appeals by this year's end unless a solution emerges to the current impasse."
694,B,"The Arctic Council convened for the eleventh time in early May 2019 in Rovaniemi, Finland, for a two-day conference. On May 7, the Arctic Council released a Joint Ministerial Statement that affirmed the desire of the eight member states to work together to face upcoming challenges but made no substantive commitments and no mention of climate change. In remarks to the Council, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo expressed wariness about collective decision making and warned against potential effects of Chinese activity in the Arctic."
695,B,"The Trump administration has continued its efforts to restrict immigration through a series of measures designed to limit the availability of asylum in the United States and to promote increased immigration enforcement in Mexico. In July of 2019, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) promulgated an interim final rule disqualifying asylum applicants who transited through third countries without seeking protection in those countries. This rule immediately became the subject of ongoing litigation, and, in September of 2019, the Supreme Court stayed an injunction that had been issued against its enforcement, with two justices dissenting. At the international level, over the summer and early fall of 2019, threats of economic sanctions led Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Mexico to make agreements with the United States aimed at curbing unauthorized migration into the United States. Guatemala signed an agreement with the United States under which asylum applicants in the United States who had transited through Guatemala on the way could be returned to Guatemala to pursue their asylum claims. El Salvador and Honduras also reached agreements with the United States relating to migration. Mexico committed to increasing its efforts to stem the flow of unauthorized immigration through its borders and assented to the U.S. expansion of its Migrant Protection Protocols. The Trump administration has continued pursuing other tactics to limit immigration and the availability of asylum, including through the issuance of legal decisions by Attorney General William Barr and continued litigation surrounding the construction of a border wall."
696,B,"On June 10, 2019, the Supreme Court denied certiorari in a case in which the D.C. Circuit held that the United States could continue to detain an individual at Guantanamo Bay until the cessation of the hostilities that justified his initial detention, notwithstanding the extraordinary length of the hostilities to date. The case, Al-Alwi v. Trump, arises from petitioner Moath Hamza Ahmed Al-Alwi's petition for a writ of habeas corpus challenging the legality of his continued detention at the United States Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay. The Supreme Court's denial of certiorari was accompanied by a statement by Justice Breyer observing that """"it is past time to confront the difficult question"""" of how long a detention grounded in the U.S. response to the September 11 attacks can be justified."
697,B,"In transborder environmental protection, territorial disputes, internet governance, anticorruption, international human rights, and humanitarian law, private businesses are increasingly supporting the implementation and enforcement of international law. This Article analyzes the various ways that corporate decision making contributes to this phenomenon, and assesses its prospects for enhancing international law's existing enforcement paradigms. In doing so, the Article opens new ground for scholarly and policy consideration of the proper role of corporations in the global legal order."
698,B,"International law, though formally neutral among regime types, has mainly been a product of liberal democracies since World War II. In light of recent challenges to the liberal international order, this Article asks, what would international law look like in an increasingly authoritarian world? As compared with democratic countries, authoritarians emphasize looser cooperation, negotiated settlements, and rules that reinforce regime survival. This raises the possibility of authoritarian international law, designed to extend authoritarian rule across time and space."
699,B,"In Google LLC v. Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertes (CNIL), the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU or Court) held that the EU law only requires valid """"right to be forgotten"""" de-referencing requests to be carried out by a search engine operator on search engine versions accessible in EU member states, as opposed to all versions of its search engine worldwide. While the ruling has been perceived as a """"win"""" for Google and other interveners, such as Microsoft and the Wikimedia Foundation, who argued against worldwide de-referencing, the Court also made clear that that while the EU law does not currently require worldwide de-referencing, """"it also does not prohibit such a practice"""" (para. 72). As a result, the CJEU found that an order by a national supervisory or judicial authority of an EU member state requiring worldwide de-referencing in accordance with its own national data protection laws would not be inconsistent with EU law where the data subject's right to privacy is adequately balanced against the right to freedom of information. By leaving the door to extraterritorial de-referencing wide open, the CJEU continues to pursue its post-Snowden hard-line stance on data privacy in a manner that is likely to transform the data privacy landscape."
700,B,"Jadhav Case (India v. Pakistan) concerned Pakistan's arrest, detention, conviction, and death sentence of Kulbhushan Sudhir Jadhav, asserted by India to be an Indian national, who had been convicted of engaging in acts of terrorism and espionage in Pakistan. This is the third dispute over the interpretation of Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (VCCR) to come before the International Court of Justice (ICJ). In contrast to the Applicants in the previous consular rights cases, India sought relief that included the annulment of Jadhav's conviction in Pakistan, his release from custody, and his safe transfer to India. After unanimously finding it had jurisdiction, fifteen judges of the ICJ, with only Judge ad hoc Jillani dissenting, held on the merits that Pakistan had breached VCCR Article 36 by failing to inform Jadhav without delay of his rights under that provision; by failing to notify without delay the appropriate consular post of India in Pakistan of his detention; and by depriving India of its right to communicate with Jadhav, to visit him in detention, and arrange for his legal representation. In addition, the Court, with only Judge ad hoc Jillani dissenting, found that Pakistan is under an obligation to inform Jadhav of his rights without further delay and is obliged to provide Indian consular officers access to him. The Court further found that appropriate reparation required Pakistan to provide, by means of its own choosing, effective review and reconsideration of Jadhav's conviction and sentence to ensure that full weight is given to the effect of the violation of his rights. Finally, the ICJ, again with Judge ad hoc Jillani dissenting, declared that a continued stay of execution constituted an indispensable condition for the effective review and reconsideration of Jadhav's conviction and sentence."
701,B,"On April 11, 1994, approximately two thousand men, women, and children were brutally murdered by armed Hutu extremists after a group of Belgian UN peacekeepers abandoned the school facility where they had sought refuge upon the outbreak of the Rwandan genocide. Almost a quarter of a century later, the Brussels Court of Appeal (Court) on June 8, 2018 concluded the civil proceedings lodged by a number of Rwandan survivors and relatives against the Belgian commanding officers and the Belgian state. Overturning an earlier judgment of the Brussels Court of First Instance, the Court held that the decision to retreat from the facility was imputable only to the United Nations, to the exclusion of the Belgian authorities. Accordingly, the claims against the Belgian state were unfounded. The events-which inspired the movie Shooting Dogs (2005)-bear obvious similarities to the role of the United Nations Protection Force's (UNPROFOR) Dutch battalion (Dutchbat) in the evacuation of the Potocari camp and the ensuing genocide of seven thousand Bosnian men and boys by Bosnian Serb forces in Srebrenica in 1995. Like the Dutch judgments in the (more well-known) Mothers of Srebrenica proceedings, the Mukeshimana appellate judgment provides a rare national court precedent that considers the imputability of the conduct of peacekeepers to troop-contributing countries. The Mukeshimana judgment, however, raises a high bar for finding such imputability."
702,B,"In a judgment issued on June 6, 2019 (Judgment), the Colombian Constitutional Court (Court) examined the constitutionality of the Agreement for the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments between Colombia and France (Agreement). The Court upheld the constitutionality of the Agreement on the condition that the government adopt a joint interpretative statement with France to clarify some of its provisions and prevent interpretations contrary to the Colombian constitutional order. In doing so, the Court articulated a standard of review that takes into account the benefits and costs of international investment agreements (IIAs), the application of which entailed an insightful examination of the Agreement in light of the decisions of investment tribunals. The judgment raises significant issues of public international law, including the practical implications of conditioning ratification of the Agreement on adoption of a joint interpretative statement and the role of such statements in the interpretation of IIAs. Furthermore, the judgment makes important contributions to the ongoing process of reform of the investment treaty regime and the strategies adopted by states to counter the adverse impacts of IIAs on regulatory autonomy."
703,B,"The July 2019 decision of the Supreme Court of the Netherlands constitutes the final act of a long litigation arising from the July 1995 genocide in Srebrenica. After Bosnian Serb militias attacked the safe area of Srebrenica, members of the Dutch battalion (Dutchbat), which was responsible for safeguarding the enclave under a UN mandate, permitted between 8,000 and 10,000 men and boys to be taken away by Bosnian Serb forces. Those men and boys were eventually killed by forces commanded by General Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic, president of the autonomous Republika Srpska. This Supreme Court decision and related rulings involve issues of international responsibility for the conduct of peacekeepers-in particular, attribution of conduct to the United Nations and its member states and immunity of international organizations."
704,B,"With Judgment No. 21995/2019 (the Judgment), the Italian Court of Cassation (Court of Cassation) once again tackled the limits of sovereign immunity with regard to crimes against humanity (para. 7). The Judgment is part of litigation originating in Greece with the Leivadia Tribunal's 1997Distomodecision, confirmed in 2000 by the Areopago (Hellenic Supreme Court), which ordered Germany to pay compensation and legal costs of approximately 50 million euros to the relatives of 218 victims of the Distomo massacre committed by the German military in 1944. In this Judgment, the Court of Cassation addressed whether sovereign immunity blocked the seizure of German assets located in Italy as part of that compensation order. The Court of Cassation's decision is noteworthy because it takes the discussion on sovereign immunity from jurisdiction and crimes against humanity one step further by addressing, in particular, the question of compensation and attachment of claims and rights held by the debtor against third parties."
705,F,"This research examines social media users' value-creation processes and the drivers of a start-up company's successful social media strategy. This research primarily aims to understand start-ups' effective utilization of social media and value co-creation processes. Although utilizing social media has become key for many organizations, start-ups and small businesses often suffer from a lack of understanding and knowledge of the utilization of social media tools. 'therefore, this article uses a case study on the relationship between a social media platform and users' value co-creation to offer a conceptual framework for start-ups to consider in utilizing social media. Our research reveals that four core drivers of social media success include experience, satisfaction, expression, and sharing ability. Each of these drivers in turn contains conditions for understanding users' value-creation process and the creation of drivers for successful social media strategies. The research contributes to literature by providing a detailed review of users' value co-creation as a part of a start-up's successful social media strategy."
706,F,"The purpose of this study is to explore whether the ability to adjust and redistribute resources has a positive effect on improving a supply chain's competitive capabilities. In addition, we also verify whether information transparency is an antecedent to improving the ability to adjust and redistribute resources. Finally, this study explores the moderating effects of investment cost controls and absolute dominance on the relationship between information transparency and the ability to adjust and redistribute resources. A partial least squares (PLS) analysis was the main method used in this study. The empirical data were obtained from the International Manufacturing Strategy Survey (IMSS). Regarding the research results, in addition to the relationships among information transparency, resource adjustment and redistribution ability, and supply chain competitive capabilities, our research results demonstrated that overemphasizing investment cost controls and absolute dominance will moderate the relationship between information transparency and resource adjustment and redistribution ability and further lead to weak competitive capabilities."
707,F,"This paper explores the factors potentially responsible for the overconsumption of office paper and estimates the adverse environmental and economic impact of overconsumption. Data were collected from the employees of selected higher educational institutions in Oman. Technical factors, workplace environment, printing preferences and lack of awareness were found the main cause of overconsumption. Environmental and economic impact of the paper was estimated from the actual amount of paper consumed using standard formulas from literature. The institutions have used 5,200 reams (13 tons) of 80gm A4 size paper in one year. The economic cost of the paper was 7,800 OMR (20,280 US$). The environmental impact estimated are: cutting of 312 trees, 73,970 lbs of CO2 gas emission, 144,742 KWh of energy consumption, solid waste produced 29,614 lbs and 247975 gallons of water were wasted. Changing printing preferences, a significant amount of economic and environmental resources to the tune of 44.8% can be saved."
708,F,"The development of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative is formed by several cultural, economic, social, political and institutional factors which have an impact on setting the priorities and advancement of CSR practices. The aim of this study is to assess CSR performance at the country level. In order to achieve this aim, the main drivers and barriers of CSR initiatives were identified and systematized based on literature review. The policies to address these barriers were analysed and discussed. The framework for the assessment of CSR performance was developed based on the analysis and assessment of the quality of political-regulatory, economic and social environment, implemented public policies to promote CSR and successes that were achieved by countries in implementing recommendations for public policy advancement. The indicators from Venture Capital and Private Equity Country Attractiveness Index, CSR policies areas reviews and EU recommendations for the improvement of public policies linked to the CSR were applied for assessing the CSR performance. The empirical analysis and the assessment of CSR performance in the Baltic States was performed based on the developed framework and policy recommendations that were developed for other countries, taking into account the priorities of """"The Belt and Road"""" project that was initiated by the Chinese government and aiming at sustainable development and global risk mitigation."
709,F,"A region can internationalise in various ways. The question is what type of internationalisation at regional level can be regarded as """"smart"""" and what role should be played in it by foreign owned entities (FOEs)? The paper aims at identifying the role played by FOEs in NUTS-2 smart specialisations' (SS's) internationalisation through exports. With the use of a set of PCSE regressions, the paper depicts the role of FOEs in creating SS-compliant exports against the background of their influence on total regional exports. The obtained results proved the positive role of FOEs in regional exports per se and SS-compliant exports. Yet, FOEs differed substantially, as compared to indigenous entities, in terms of product/regional specialisation and technological advancement. The findings imply the importance of FOEs' embeddedness in regions' economies and possibility of their incorporation in creating or enhancing regional comparative advantages. The paper contributes by: (i) providing empirical verification of one of the aspects of SS strategy which is exports and establishing comprehensive insight into the evaluation of SS, (ii) depicting the role of FOEs in generating SS-compliant exports, (iii) proposing a set of measures to be used in the extended empirical evaluation of SS consequences in the sphere of exports."
710,F,"The aim of this research is to analyse (i) influence of cooperation with different partners and public funding on firms' willingness to innovate; (ii) how public funding and cooperation with different partners influence firms' innovation performance (turnover); (iii) effects of mutual interactions between firms' innovation activities, cooperation with different partners and public funding on firms' innovation performance (measured with turnover). The situation of 561 firms in Machines and Equipment industries in Germany was analysed because it is one of the most competitive economy in the world and one of the leaders in innovation within European Union. It allows to create unique benchmark and to propose implications that will be more appropriate and applicable also in other countries. For analyses, the data from Community Innovation Survey 2012-2014, which is a harmonized questionnaire and provides EU's science and technology statistics, was used, and new binary and multiple linear regression models were employed. Results of analyses show that provision of public subsidies, unlike cooperation, strongly influence firm's motivation to innovate. However, results also showed that supported innovation activities do not always lead to an increase in firms' innovative performance. Therefore, it can be pointed to the phenomenon of inefficiency of public innovation support in final consequence."
711,F,"The effect of finance business partnering (FBP) implementation on the firm performance remains largely unexplored. The main aims of this study are to investigate whether there is a significant effect between FBP and firm performance and to identify the mediating effect of non-financial performance between FBP and firm performance. A questionnaire-based survey was conducted among 117 Chinese manufacturing firms in the year 2018, and research hypotheses were tested by partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). The findings showed that 1) FBP does not exert a significant and direct effect on the firms' financial performance, 2) when non-financial measures (employees performance, internal process performance, and market performance) are used as mediating variables, the effect of all the three mediating variables on the relationship between FBP and non-financial variables are positive and significant. However, when the relationship between non-financial measures and firm's performance is considered, the mediating effect of the non- financial variables is positive and significant only for the market performance. This study provides, for the first time, empirical evidence that non-financial performance, such as employee skills, internal processes, and market performance, can be enhanced by considering FBP. It also provides practical implications suggesting that manufacturing firms should motivate finance staff to be involved in various decision-making processes."
712,G,"Objective: To describe the health and occupational risks of informal waste workers (IWWs) in the Kathmandu Valley and explore the factors associated with not using personal protective equipment (PPE). Study design: This is a cross-sectional survey of IWWs. Methods: Data were collected on the health and occupational risks of adult IWWs working on waste sites in the Kathmandu Valley and in the adjacent Nuwakot district, Nepal, in November 2017, through convenience sampling. Using a standardized health assessment questionnaire, face-to-face interviews were undertaken to record sociodemographic data, indicators of general and occupational health, data on healthcare access and use, physical risks, perception of occupational risks and use of PPE. Associations between use of PPE and gender, age, education, country of origin, injury and perception of occupational risks were examined using multivariate logistic regression analyses. Results: In 1278 surveyed IWWs, prevalent physical risks included injuries (66.2% in the previous 12 months), and the main reported symptoms were respiratory in nature (69.9% in the previous 3 months). Most prevalent injuries were glass cuts (44.4%) and metal cuts (43.9%). Less than half of the IWWs (46.8%) had been vaccinated against tetanus and 7.5% against hepatitis B. The work was considered as 'risky' by 72.5% of IWWs, but 67.6% did not use PPE. Non-use of PPE was independently associated with male gender (odds ratio [OR] 2.19; P < 0.001), Indian origin (OR 1.35; P = 0.018), older age (OR 2.97 for more than the age of 55 years; P = 0.007) and low perception of occupational risks (OR 2.41; P < 0.001). Low perception of occupational risk was associated with older age (55 + years) and the lack of receipt of information on the risks. Conclusions: IWWs are at increased risk of injury in their work, yet are poorly protected in relation to vaccine-preventable infections and workwear. The results suggest that information is important in relation to perception of occupational risk, which in turn is associated with the use of PPE. There is a need for policymakers and public health practitioners to have a robust understanding of the needs and vulnerabilities of this group, as well as identify effective interventions that can be taken to safeguard the health and welfare of IWWs.

713,G,"Objectives: Planning and implementing public health initiatives in mass gatherings such as the Olympic Games pose unique challenges for interorganizational collaboration, which involves interaction among multiple and diverse agencies. Nonetheless, there is limited empirical evidence to support interagency collaboration and public health planning decisions in mass gatherings and how leadership can shape such interactions. We empirically explored these topics in the 2012 London Olympics to identify lessons to inform planning for future mass gatherings. Study design: This is a qualitative case study. Methods: Data comprised 39 semistructured interviews with key informants conducted before, during, and after the games; in addition, direct observations of field exercises and documentary analysis were also used. Open coding and thematic analysis was used to analyze the data. Results: We identified two main leadership challenges that influenced interagency collaboration: organizational public health leadership and coordinating collaborative decision-making. Two facilitative conditions helped overcome the previous challenges: nurturing interorganizational linkages and creating shared understanding by activating codified frameworks at the organizational level. Conclusions: Our study highlights leadership issues in interagency collaboration in mass gatherings. Practical implications arising from this study may inform the ways the organizers of mass gatherings, public health and safety agencies, and professionals can engage in effective partnerships and joint working.

714,G,"Objectives: This natural experiment was designed to assess the impact of exposure to an active case of tuberculosis (TB) on a group of immunosuppressed individuals, with end-stage renal disease over an extended follow-up. Study design: Close contacts of people with sputum smear-positive Mycobacterium tuberculosis are at high risk of infection, particularly immunosuppressed individuals. An infectious TB healthcare worker worked in a renal dialysis unit for a month before diagnosis, with 104 renal dialysis patients, was exposed for >= 8 h. Methods: Patients were informed and invited for screening 8-10 weeks postexposure. They either underwent standard two-step assessment with tuberculin skin test (TST) and QuantiFERON (R)-TB Gold (Cellestis GmbH; QFN) interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) or after consent, enrolled in a study where these two tests were performed simultaneously with T-SPOT (R)-TB (Oxford Immunotec Ltd; TSPOT). Patients within the study were followed up for 2 years from exposure, with QFN and TSPOT repeated at months 3 and 6 from the first testing. Results: Of 104 exposed individuals, 75 enrolled in the study. There was a high degree of discordance among QFN, TSPOT and TST. This was seen at both the first time point and also over time in subjects who were retested. No patients had active TB at the baseline testing. None received treatment for latent TB infection. Over the following 2 years, no one developed TB disease. Conclusion: This study suggests that there is a low risk of progression to active TB in low-incidence countries even in high-risk groups. This plus the degree of the test result discordance emphasises the complexities of managing TB in such settings as it is unclear which of these tests, if any, provides the best diagnostic accuracy.

715,G,"Objectives: The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of food insufficiency, a more severe form of food insecurity, across levels of special healthcare needs among a nationally representative sample of children in the United States. The study also investigates whether medical home access serves as a possible protective mechanism against food hardship. Study design: The study involves analysis of nationally representative cross-sectional data. Methods: The data used are the 2016 National Survey of Children's Health, a cross-sectional nationally representative sample of the US children (N = 48,709). Descriptive analyses and logistic regression analysis are used to estimate food insufficiency and its correlates by complexity of children's special healthcare needs. Results: Analysis showed that children with more complex special healthcare needs experienced roughly twice the rate of food insufficiency compared with children with no special healthcare needs or children with less complex healthcare needs. Multivariate analysis indicated that children with more complex healthcare needs face an increased risk of food insufficiency net of demographic and economic characteristics. Interaction models revealed that medical home access protects children with medical complexity from food insufficiency. Conclusions: These findings document significantly elevated risk of food insufficiency among families with a child facing more complex special healthcare needs. Interventions in healthcare settings could include referrals to resources already in place to combat hunger such as food bank agencies and other resources that might help at-risk families obtain assistance through programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Women, Infants, and Children.

716,G,"Objectives: To examine relationships between short-term and long-term exposures to unconventional natural gas development, commonly known as fracking, and county hospitalization rates for a variety of broad disease categories. Study design: This is an ecological study based on county-level data for Pennsylvania, United States, 2003-2014. Methods: We estimated multivariate regressions with county and year fixed effects, using two 12-year panels: all 67 Pennsylvania counties and 54 counties that are not large metropolitan. Results: After correcting for multiple comparisons, we found a positive association of cumulative well density (per km(2)) with genitourinary hospitalization rates. When large metropolitan counties were excluded, this relationship persisted, and positive associations of skin-related hospitalization rates with cumulative well count and well density were observed. The association with genitourinary hospitalization rates is driven by females in 20-64 years group, particularly for kidney infections, calculus of ureter, and urinary tract infection. Contemporaneous wells drilled were not significantly associated with hospitalizations after adjustment for multiple comparisons. Conclusions: Our study shows that long-term exposure to unconventional gas development may have an impact on prevalence of hospitalizations for certain diseases in the affected populations and identifies areas of future research on unconventional gas development and health.

717,G,"Objectives: Increasing research capacity is important for health services as part of improving the conduct of high-quality research, which addresses the needs of patients and the public. It is a core function of the 13 Collaborations for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRCs) established in England between 2008 and 2013. This article reports on the development of an innovative capacity building programme in CLAHRC West over an 18-month period (May 2015 to December 2016). It aims to disseminate the learning from the initiative and share our experience with other CLAHRCs. Study design: The study design was an evaluation of a training programme to build research capacity. Methods: We carried out a training needs assessment among local stakeholders and scoped existing provision of research-related training. This informed the development of a programme of free short courses, which were targeted at health and social care professionals including those working in local authorities and the voluntary sector. We aimed to engage professionals working at all levels in these organisations and to promote interprofessional education, to build a research culture. We engaged a variety of educators to provide a range of 1-day courses at an introductory level, which were accessible to practitioners. Results: During the first 18 months of the training programme, we delivered 31 courses and trained 350 participants. Attendees came from secondary care (20%), voluntary sector (18%) and local authorities (18%). Professionals working in the mental health sector comprised 11% and commissioning 6%. Less well represented were primary care (3%) and community care (4%). The largest professional group was public health, followed by medical, nursing and allied health professionals in approximately equal proportions. Courses were evaluated on a scale of 1 (poor) to 4 (excellent) with the mean being 3.6 (range 3.3-4.0). Conclusions: The training programme has been highly successful with many courses oversubscribed, and all courses being well evaluated by participants. It has met the needs of local professionals for brief, applied training in research, as well as attracting those from other parts of the United Kingdom, suggesting the courses are both appropriate and helping to fill a gap in provision. We are building on this work to further engage audiences working in areas such as the wider determinants of health and commissioning, as well as primary and community sectors. CLAHRCs are uniquely placed to drive a culture change in the use, understanding and application of research across the healthcare community.

718,G,"Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the association between childhood injury and health outcomes among survivors and their mothers using a national survey in the United States (US). Study design: This was a longitudinal analysis of a nationally representative sample. Methods: Secondary analysis of the 1997-2013 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) was performed. Children (aged 2-18 years) with or without injuries were followed up for two years. Injuries captured in the study were those associated with at least one hospitalization, emergency department visit, or office-based visit. Outcome measures were child and maternal general and mental health status. Multiple mixed-logistic regressions were used with suboptimal health defined as the response of poor or fair health versus good, very good, or excellent health. Results: Of the 63,422 children analyzed, 3251 (4.9%) were injured, representing 3.6 million US children. Injured children were more likely to be male, white, and older than those without injuries (P < 0.01). About a fifth of injured children suffered head injuries. Injuries were strongly associated with suboptimal general and mental health status in children (adjusted odds ratios [AORs], 1.35 and 1.36, respectively, P < 0.05). Mothers of children with injuries were also more likely to report suboptimal mental health (AOR, 1.30, P < 0.05). Conclusion: Injuries among children are associated with lasting adverse effects in general and mental health. To improve health outcomes of pediatric injuries, further follow-up care may be needed to ensure that they return to pre-injury health levels. These results highlight the importance of primary prevention and the long-term impact of injuries on the health of children and their mothers. (C) 2019 The Royal Society for Public Health.

719,G,"Objective: The aim of the study was to examine trends in cold-related mortalities between 1995 and 2016. Study design: This is a longitudinal mortality study. Methods: For men and women aged 65-74 years or those older than 85 years in South East England, the relationship between daily mortality (deaths per million population) and outdoor temperatures below 18 degrees C, with allowance for influenza epidemics, was assessed by linear regression on an annual basis. The regression coefficients were expressed as a percentage of the mortality at 18 degrees C to adjust for changes in mortality through health care. Trends in 'specific' cold-related mortalities were then examined over two periods, 1977 -1994 and 1995-2016. Results: In contrast to the early period, annual trends in cold-related specific mortalities showed no decline between 1995 and 2016. 'Specific' cold-related mortality of women, but not men, in the age group older than 85 years showed a significant increase over the 1995 -2016 period, which was different from the trend over the earlier period (P < 0.01). Conclusion: Despite state-funded benefits to help alleviate fuel poverty and public health advice, very elderly women appear to be at increasing risk of cold-related mortalitydgreater help may be necessary.

720,G,"Objectives: A routine review of hepatitis A travel vaccination recommendations was brought forward in June 2017 due to hepatitis A vaccine shortages and a concurrent outbreak in men who have sex with men (MSM). There were three objectives: first, to document the review process for changing the recommendations for the UK travellers in June 2017. Second, to study the impact of these changes on prescribing in general practice in 2017 compared with the previous 5 years. Third, to study any changes in hepatitis A notifications in June-October 2017 compared with the previous 5 years. Study design: This is an observational study. Methods: Travel vaccination recommendations for countries with either low-risk (<20%) or high-risk (>90%) status according to child hepatitis A seroprevalence were not changed. A total of 67 intermediate-risk countries with existing recommendations for most travellers and with new data on rural sanitation levels were shortlisted for the analysis. Data on child hepatitis A seroprevalence, country income status, access to sanitation in rural areas and traveller volumes were obtained. Information about the vaccine supply was obtained from Public Health England. Changes to the existing classification were made through expert consensus, based on countries' hepatitis A seroprevalence, sanitation levels, level of income, volume of travel and hepatitis A traveller cases. Data on the number of combined and monovalent hepatitis A-containing vaccines prescribed in England, 2012-2017, were obtained from the National Health Service Business Service Authorities. The number of monthly prescriptions for January-September 2017 was compared with the mean number of prescriptions for the same month in the previous 5 years (t-test, alpha = 5%, df = 4). The number of hepatitis A cases notified in June-October 2017 not related to the MSM outbreak was compared with the number of notifications in the same months in previous years. Results: A total of 36 countries were downgraded based on good access (80+% of population) to sanitation in rural areas and the intermediate-risk status in terms of child hepatitis A seroprevalence. For these countries, vaccination would only be recommended to travellers staying long term, visiting friends and relatives or staying in areas without good sanitation. There was a significant decline in hepatitis A vaccine prescriptions in June-September 2017, and there was no increase in the number of notifications. Conclusions: Hepatitis A vaccination recommendations for travel were revised in 2017 following a systematic approach to maintain continuity of supply after a hepatitis A vaccine shortage and increased hepatitis A vaccine demand related to a large outbreak. Improved access to good sanitation in rural areas and low seroprevalence estimates among children have led to 36 countries to no longer require vaccination for most travellers. These changes do not seem to have impacted on hepatitis A notifications in England, although further research will be needed to quantify the impact more precisely.

721,G,"Objectives: Since 2010, the number of homeless people in the UK has increased, and homelessness in its different types has become a major public health problem. Housed older people with past experience of homelessness are an understudied population that can provide valuable insight into this problem. For this reason, we examined the lifetime prevalence of homelessness and its associations with childhood adversity and mortality in a national sample of older people. Study design: This is a longitudinal cohort study. Methods: We studied 6649 housed individuals aged 55-79 years in 2007 from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). We used logistic regression to model the association between adverse childhood experiences (ACE) and lifetime experience of homelessness (ever been homeless for >= 1 months) and Cox proportional hazards regression to model the prospective association between lifetime experience of homelessness and mortality. Results: We identified 107 participants with lifetime experience of homelessness. We found a strong graded association between the number of ACE and lifetime experience of homelessness; participants with two ACE had 5.35 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.17-9.05) times greater odds of having experienced homelessness than those reporting none. Most ACE were individually associated with lifetime homelessness, but fewer remained so in the mutually adjusted model. Participants with lifetime experience of homelessness had 1.55 (95% CI: 1.01-2.37) times greater risk of mortality over a 10-year follow-up and after adjustment for covariates. Conclusions: Exposure to childhood adversity is associated with increased risk of experiencing home-lessness. Older housed people with past experience of homelessness are at increased risk of mortality. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Royal Society for Public Health."
722,G,"Objectives: A constant challenge in addressing the issue of obesity is the validity and reliability of self-reported measurements to calculate body mass index, that assesses the prevalence of obesity in a population. The objective of this study is to analyze both awareness and accuracy of mothers who are overweight or obese, in reporting their own and their child's height and weight measurements. Study design: cross-sectional study. Methods: In this study, mothers were asked over phone to self-report height and weight for them and their child. This was followed by objective measurement of maternal and child height and weight by study staff in a clinical setting. The descriptive and statistical analysis of the data obtained were carried out using SAS software. Results: 1) The mean weight of mothers who inaccurately self-reported their weight was 9.5 kg greater than the mean weight of those who reported accurately (P < 0.001). (2) Despite being aware of, and reporting their own measurements, 50% (n = 116) of mothers reported not knowing their child's height and 23% (n = 54) of them reported not knowing their child's weight. Conclusion: Strategies to tackle both maternal awareness and accuracy of child's measurements can help with early identification of child's obesity risk and prevention of long-term consequences.

723,G,"Objectives: To explore what actually happens in relation to physical activity promotion in primary and junior schools within one unitary authority and to relate this to Public Health England (PHE) promising principles of practice to promote physical activity in schools. Study design: A qualitative approach was undertaken to explore practice in all primary and junior schools in the unitary authority of Southampton. Methods: All primary (n = 36) and junior (n = 8) schools in Southampton were involved in the study. Publicly available primary physical education and sport premium (PESP) funding reports (n = 36) alongside a school survey (n = 14) were collated. The collated qualitative data set was semantically coded and then a multilayered approach including identification, reviewing, defining and naming meaningful and important themes were inductively developed. The inductively developed themes were then fitted in relation to PHE eight promising principles. Results: There was evidence of practice across all eight promising principles although this varied in depth and scale. There was one set of data that did not fit appropriately within the PHE eight promising principles and warranted its own category broadly termed 'rewards to recognise physical activity'. There was widespread evidence of PESP funding providing increased provision, variety and quality of sport opportunities but limited evidence of physical activity practice or programmes targeting the least active. Two different approaches in relation to ensuring a skilled workforce materialised continuing professional development which reflected in impact statements linked to increased confidence to deliver and quality of physical education versus outsourcing to specialists with little impact cited other than offering specialist or diverse sports. Conclusions: The study demonstrated that the PHE eight promising principles of practice was a useful framework in relation to current practice, although a ninth promising principle of rewarding physically active behaviour should be considered. The two key themes that need to be addressed for the ambitions established in the new school sport and activity action plan to be deliverable, with PESP funding as a driver, are skilled workforce and development of a wider understanding of what physical activity is.

724,G,"Objective: With the current SARS-CoV2 outbreak, countless tests need to be performed on potential symptomatic individuals, contacts and travellers. The gold standard is a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based system taking several hours to confirm positivity. For effective public health containment measures, this time span is too long. We therefore evaluated a rapid test in a high-prevalence community setting. Study design: Thirty-nine randomly selected individuals at a COVID-19 screening centre were simultaneously tested via qPCR and a rapid test. Ten previously diagnosed individuals with known SARS-CoV-2 infection were also analysed. Methods: The evaluated rapid test is an IgG/IgM-based test for SARS-CoV-2 with a time to result of 20 min. Two drops of blood are needed for the test performance. Results: Of 49 individuals, 22 tested positive by repeated qPCR. In contrast, the rapid test detected only eight of those positive correctly (sensitivity: 36.4%). Of the 27 qPCR-negative individuals, 24 were detected correctly (specificity: 88.9%). Conclusion: Given the low sensitivity, we recommend not to rely on an antibody-based rapid test for public health measures such as community screenings. (C) 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health.

725,G,"Objectives: We assess the individual willingness to pay for diseases arising from risky lifestyles and investigate the personal factors that influence such willingness. Study design: We conducted an online survey with 821 respondents in Italy. The questionnaire was distributed via Facebook (R) in July and August 2016. The questionnaire covered sociodemographic characteristics, health status, behaviour and psychological attitudes, economic status, and opinion about covering the healthcare costs related to overeating, unhealthy diet, sedentary lifestyles, alcohol abuse, tobacco smoking, driving under the influence of alcohol, and illegal drug use by. Methods: We performed the following: (1) the study of the patterns in the dependent variables by principal component analysis; (2) analysis of the determinants by Holdout Variable Importance measure obtained in Random Forest; and (3) we used ordered logit models. Results: Participants agreed with the idea that public health care should be provided for problems arising from bad eating habits and sedentary lifestyle (50.4%), whereas the health care consequences of the other risky behaviours should not be publicly financed by the Italian National Health Service. Conclusions: Our study gives an overview of the willingness to pay of a population living in a country where financing of the Health Service is based on general taxation. So, these results may be generalized, with due caution, to all the countries where the Health Service offers universal coverage and is operated by the government, but of course not to scenarios related to market-based or social health insurance systems.

726,G,"Objectives: Problem gamblers in treatment are known to be at high risk for suicidality, but few studies have examined if this is evident in community samples. Evidence is mixed on the extent to which an association between problem gambling and suicidality may be explained by psychiatric comorbidity. We tested whether they are associated after adjustment for co-occurring mental disorders and other factors. Study design: Secondary analysis of the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey 2007, a cross-sectional national probability sample survey of 7403 adults living in households in England. Methods: Rates of suicidality in problem gamblers and the rest of the population were compared. A series of logistic regression models assessed the impact of adjustment on the relationship between problem gambling and suicidality. Results: Past year suicidality was reported in 19.2% of problem gamblers, compared with 4.4% in the rest of the population. Their unadjusted odds ratios (OR) of suicidality were 5.3 times higher. Odds attenuated but remained significant when depression and anxiety disorders, substance dependences, attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder, and other factors were accounted for (adjusted OR = 2.9, 95% confidence interval = 1. 1, 8.1 P = 0.023). Conclusions: Problem gamblers are a high-risk group for suicidality. This should be recognised in individual suicide prevention plans and local and national suicide prevention strategies. While some of this relationship is explained by other factors, a significant and substantial association between problem gambling and suicidality remains. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

727,G,"There is a growing consensus that gambling is a public health issue and that preventing gambling related harms requires a broad response. Although many policy decisions regarding gambling are made at a national level in the UK, there are clear opportunities to take action at local and regional levels to prevent the negative impacts on individuals, families and local communities. This response goes beyond the statutory roles of licencing authorities to include amongst others the National Health Service (NHS), the third sector, mental health services, homelessness and housing services, financial inclusion support. As evidence continues to emerge to strengthen the link between gambling and a wide range of risk factors and negative consequences, there is also a strong correlation with health inequalities. Because the North of England experiences increasing health inequalities, it offers an opportunity as a specific case study to share learning on reducing gambling-related harms within a geographic area. This article describes an approach to gambling as a public health issue identifying it as needing a cross-cutting, systemwide multisectoral approach to be taken at local and regional levels. Challenges at national and local levels require policy makers to adopt a 'health in all policy' approach and use the best evidence in their future decisions to prevent harm. A whole systems approach which aims to reduce poverty and health inequalities needs to incorporate gambling harm within place-based planning and draws on the innovative opportunities that exist to engage local stakeholders, builds local leadership and takes a collaborative approach to tackling gambling-related harms. This whole systems approach includes the following: (1) understanding the prevalence of gambling related harms with insights into the consequences and how individuals, their family and friends and wider community are affected; (2) ensuring tackling gambling harms is a key public health commitment at all levels by including it in strategic plans, with meaningful outcome measures, and communicating this to partners; (3) understanding the assets and resources available in the public, private and voluntary sectors and identifying what actions are underway; (4) raising awareness and sharing data, developing a compelling narrative and involving people who have been harmed and are willing to share their experience; (5) ensuring all regulatory authorities help tackle gambling-related harms under a 'whole council' approach.

728,G,"Objective: Gambling operators in the United Kingdom have introduced a voluntary ban on adverts broadcast during televised sport before 21:00 (the 'whistle-to-whistle' ban). To inform debates around the potential effectiveness of this ban, we examine the frequency and nature of gambling marketing in televised broadcasts across professional sporting events. Study design: Frequency analysis of verbal and visual gambling marketing references during television broadcasts of football (n = 5), tennis, Formula 1, boxing and rugby union (each n = 1) from 2018. Methods: For each gambling reference, we coded: whether it appeared in-play or out-of-play; location (e.g. pitch-side advertising); format (e.g. branded merchandise); duration (s); number of identical references visible simultaneously; brand; and presence of age restriction or harm-reduction messages. Results: Boxing contained the most gambling references, on average, per broadcast minute (4.70 references), followed by football (2.75), rugby union (0.55) and tennis (0.11). Formula 1 contained no gambling references. In boxing, references most frequently appeared within the area-of-play. For football and rugby union, references most frequently appeared around the pitch border or within the area-of-play (e.g. branded shirts). Only a small minority of references were for adverts during commercial breaks that would be subject to the whistle-to-whistle ban (e.g. 2% of references in football). Less than 1% of references in boxing and only 3% of references in football contained age restriction or harm-reduction messages. Conclusions: As gambling sponsorship extends much beyond adverts in commercial breaks, the 'whistle-to-whistle' ban will have limited effect on gambling exposure. Gambling sponsorship activities rarely contain harm-reduction messages. Crown Copyright (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Royal Society for Public Health."
729,G,"Objective: The inclusion and design of age restriction warnings, harm reduction messages and terms and conditions (T&Cs) in gambling advertising is self-regulated in the United Kingdom. Our study examines the visibility and nature of this information in a sample of paid-for gambling adverts. Study design: A content analysis of a stratified random sample of gambling adverts (n = 300) in the United Kingdom from eight paid-for advertising channels (March 2018). Methods: For each advert, we assessed whether any age restriction warnings, harm reduction messages and T&Cs were present. If so, visibility was scored on a five-point scale ranging from very poor (<= 10% of advert space) to very good (>= 26% of advert), which had high inter-rater reliability. Descriptive information on position, design and tone of language was recorded. Results: One in seven adverts (14%) did not feature an age restriction warning or harm reduction message. In adverts that did, 84% of age restriction warnings and 54% of harm reduction messages had very poor visibility. At least one in ten adverts did not contain T&Cs. In adverts that did, 73% had very poor visibility. For age restriction warnings, harm reduction messages and T&Cs, most appeared in small fonts and outside the main advert frame. Most harm reduction messages did not actually reference gambling-related harms. Conclusion: Age restriction warnings, harm reduction messages and T&Cs do not always appear in paidfor gambling advertising. When they do, visibility is often very poor and the messaging not clear. The findings do not support a self-regulatory approach to managing this information in gambling adverts. (C) 2020 The Authors.

730,G,"Objectives: Gambling is increasingly positioned as a public health issue, with links to a wide range of harms for individuals, communities and societies. Malawi has experienced a rapid rise in the availability of high street and online sports betting services, situated in a context of extreme inequality and poverty. We aim to document the strategies through which a leading sports betting firm have established a market worth MK2.1bn, to inform future initiatives to mitigate gambling-related harm. Study design: A case study of strategies deployed by a leading firm to grow a sports betting market in Malawi. Methods: We undertook a qualitative media analysis of articles from six major Malawian news outlets and combined this with photographic evidence relating to company advertising and presence in Malawian public space. Data were analysed thematically and triangulated to generate a typology of corporate strategies. Results: We collected 39 articles and 15 photographs. After we screened the articles, we analysed 27 and identified seven corporate strategies: adopt a mobile network franchise model; use media coverage; purchase high-visibility advertising; sponsor locally; build association with (European) football; appeal to aspects of hegemonic masculinity; construct narratives of individual and collective benefit. Conclusion: Malawi has been exposed to a sophisticated set of corporate strategies aimed at growing a sports betting market. These strategies have been successful, and it is likely that a range of foreseeable gambling-related harms are affecting Malawi. We offer suggestions for how policy-makers and public health professionals might respond. (C) 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
731,G,"Objectives: The internet has become one of the most important resources for the general population when searching for healthcare information. However, the information available is not always suitable for all readers because of its difficult readability. We sought to assess the readability of online information regarding the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and establish whether they follow the patient educational information reading level recommendations. Study design: This is a cross-sectional study. Methods: We searched five key terms on Google and the first 30 results from each of the searches were considered for analysis. Five validated readability tests were utilized to establish the reading level for each article. Results: Of the 150 gathered articles, 61 met the inclusion criteria and were evaluated. None (0%) of the articles met the recommended 5th to 6th grade reading level (of an 11-12-year-old). The mean readability scores were Flesch Reading Ease 44.14, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level 12.04, Gunning-Fog Index 14.27, Simple Measure of Gobbledygook SMOG Index 10.71, and Coleman-Liau Index 12.69. Conclusions: Online educational articles on COVID-19 provide information too difficult to read for the general population. The readability of articles regarding COVID-19 and other diseases needs to improve so that the general population may understand health information better and may respond adequately to protect themselves and limit the spread of infection.

732,G,"Background: Governments and health policymakers are now looking for strategies to lift the COVID-19 lockdown, while reducing risk to the public. Methods: We propose the population attributable risk (PAR) as an established epidemiological tool that could support decision-making through quickly estimating the main benefits and costs of various exit strategies. Results: We demonstrate the feasibility of use of PAR using pandemic data, that were publicly available in mid-May 2020 from Scotland and the US, to estimate the proportion of COVID-19 hospital admissions which might be avoided, and the proportion of adverse labour market effects - for various scenarios - based on maintaining the lockdown for those of certain ages with and without comorbidities.

733,G,"Objectives: With COVID-19 infections resulting in death according to a hierarchy of risks, with age and pre-existing health conditions enhancing disease severity, the objective of this study is to estimate the condition-specific case fatality ratio (CFR) for different subpopulations in Italy. Study design: The design of the study was to estimate the 'pre-existing comorbidity'-conditional CFR to eventually explain the mortality risk variability reported around in different countries. Methods: We use the available information on pre-existing health conditions identified for deceased patients 'positive with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)' in Italy. We (i) estimated the total number of deaths for different pre-existing health conditions categories and (ii) calculated a conditional CFR based upon the number of comorbidities before SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: Our results show a 0.6% conditional CFR for a population with zero pre-existing pathology, increasing to 13.9% for a population diagnosed with one and more pre-existing health conditions. Conclusions: Condition-specific mortality risks are important to be evaluated during the COVID-19 pandemic, with potential elements to explain the CFR variability around the globe. A careful postmortem examination of deceased cases to differentiate death 'caused by COVID-19' from death 'positive with SARS-CoV-2' is therefore urgently needed and will likely improve our understanding of the COVID-19 mortality risk and virus pathogenicity.

734,G,"Objectives: We aim to identify the factors associated with support and compliance with general quarantine and with the acceptability and potential use of a contact-tracing mobile phone application among French respondents. Study design: We conducted a cross-sectional study between April 16th and May 7th 2020 using online questionnaires. Methods: The sample was reweighted to be representative of the French population by age and sex, region and education level. Ordered logistic, logistic and negative binomial regressions were used to estimate the factors associated with quarantine support, with the opinion on quarantine extension, with the number and type of trips outside the quarantine home and with the acceptability and potential use of a contact-tracing application. Results: After reweighting, full data for regression analyses were available for 1849 respondents. Attitudes and opinions regarding quarantine are correlated with the perceived COVID-19 threat, the perceived benefits of quarantine, trust in the government, well-being during quarantine and risk preferences. Trust in the government, perceived individual health consequences in case of COVID-19 infection and time preferences are associated with the willingness to use a contact-tracing application. Conclusions: Our analysis indicates that prevention campaigns that stress the individual risk in case of infection or the benefits of quarantine could foster compliance to quarantine protocols. Remote psychological support might also promote quarantine adherence among individuals most distressed by the quarantine. Moreover, public communications should focus on restoring trust among the population as trust is strongly correlated with the willingness to use a contact-tracing application.

735,C,"Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) are thought to be remnants of the early Solar System, and their size distribution provides an opportunity to explore the formation and evolution of the outer Solar System(1-5). In particular, the size distribution of kilometre-sized (radius = 1-10 km) KBOs represents a signature of initial planetesimal sizes when planets form(5). These kilometre-sized KBOs are extremely faint, and it is impossible to detect them directly. Instead, the monitoring of stellar occultation events is one possible way to discover these small KBOs6-9. However, until now, there has been no observational evidence for occultation events of KBOs with radii of 1-10 km. Here, we report the first detection of a single occultation event candidate by a KBO with a radius of similar to 1.3 km, which was simultaneously provided by two low-cost small telescopes coupled with commercial complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor cameras. From this detection, we conclude that the surface number density of KBOs with radii exceeding similar to 1.2 km is similar to 6 x 10(5) deg(-2). This surface number density favours a theoretical size distribution model with an excess signature at a radius of 1-2 km (ref. 5). If this is a true KBO detection, this implies that planetesimals before their runaway growth phase grew into kilometre-sized objects in the primordial outer Solar System and remain as a major population in the present-day Kuiper belt."
736,C,"In contrast to the water-poor planets of the inner Solar System, stochasticity during planetary formation(1,2) and orderof- magnitude deviations in exoplanet volatile contents(3) suggest that rocky worlds engulfed in thick volatile ice layers(4,5) are the dominant family of terrestrial analogues(6,7) among the extrasolar planet population. However, the distribution of compositionally Earth-like planets remains insufficiently constrained(3), and it is not clear whether the Solar System is a statistical outlier or can be explained by more general planetary formation processes. Here we use numerical models of planet formation, evolution and interior structure to show that a planet's bulk water fraction and radius are anticorrelated with initial Al-26 levels in the planetesimal-based accretion framework. The heat generated by this short-lived radionuclide rapidly dehydrates planetesimals(8) before their accretion onto larger protoplanets and yields a system-wide correlation(9,10) of planetary bulk water abundances, which, for instance, can explain the lack of a clear orbital trend in the water budgets of the TRAPPIST-1 planets(11). Qualitatively, our models suggest two main scenarios for the formation of planetary systems: high-Al-26 systems, like our Solar System, form small, water-depleted planets, whereas those devoid of Al-26 predominantly form ocean worlds. For planets of similar mass, the mean planetary transit radii of the ocean planet population can be up to about 10% larger than for planets from the Al-26-rich formation scenario."

The remnant mass and the impact of the chemical yield on subsequent star formation and galactic evolution strongly depend on the internal physics of the progenitor star, which is currently not well understood. The theoretical uncertainties of stellar interiors accumulate with stellar age, which is particularly pertinent for the blue supergiant phase. Stellar oscillations represent a unique method of probing stellar interiors, yet inference for blue supergiants is hampered by a dearth of observed pulsation modes. Here we report the detection of diverse variability in blue supergiants using the K2 and TESS space missions. The discovery of pulsation modes or an entire spectrum of low-frequency gravity waves in these stars allow us to map the evolution of hot massive stars towards the ends of their lives. Future asteroseismic modelling will provide constraints on ages, core masses, interior mixing, rotation and angular momentum transport. The discovery of variability in blue supergiants is a step towards a data-driven empirical calibration of theoretical evolution models for the most massive stars in the Universe."
738,C,"Massive stars, supernovae, and kilonovae are among the most luminous radiation sources in the Universe. Observations usually show near-to mid-infrared (NIR-MIR, lambda approximate to 1-5 mu m) emission excess from H ii regions around young massive star clusters. Early-phase observations in optical-to-NIR wavelengths of type Ia supernovae also reveal unusual properties of dust extinction and dust polarization. The most common explanation for such NIR-MIR excess and unusual dust properties is the predominance of small grains (size a less than or similar to 0.05 mu m) relative to large grains (a >= 0.1 mu m) in the local environment of these strong radiation sources. However, why small grains might be predominant in these environments is unclear. Here we report a mechanism of dust destruction based on centrifugal stress within extremely fast-rotating grains spun-up by radiative torques, which we term radiative torque disruption (RATD). We find that RATD can disrupt large grains located within a distance of about a parsec from a massive star of luminosity L approximate to 10(4)L(circle dot), where L-circle dot is the solar luminosity, or from a supernova. This disruption effect increases the abundance of small grains relative to large grains and successfully reproduces the observed NIR-MIR excess and anomalous dust extinction/ polarization. We apply the RATD mechanism for kilonovae and find that dust within about 0.1 parsec would be dominated by small grains. Small grains produced by RATD can also explain the steep far-ultraviolet rise in extinction curves towards starburst and high-redshift galaxies, and the decrease of the escape fraction of Lyman alpha photons from H-parallel to regions surrounding young massive star clusters."
739,C,"The orbits of Saturn's inner mid-sized moons (Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione and Rhea) have been notably difficult to reconcile with their geology. Here we present numerical simulations coupling thermal, geophysical and simplified orbital evolution for 4.5 billion years that reproduce the observed characteristics of their orbits and interiors, provided that the outer four moons are old. Tidal dissipation within Saturn expands the moons' orbits over time. Dissipation within the moons decreases their eccentricities, which are episodically increased by moon-moon interactions, causing past or present oceans to exist in the interiors of Enceladus, Dione and Tethys. In contrast, Mimas's proximity to Saturn's rings generates interactions that cause such rapid orbital expansion that Mimas must have formed only 0.1-1 billion years ago if it postdates the rings. The resulting lack of radionuclides keeps it geologically inactive. These simulations explain the Mimas-Enceladus dichotomy, reconcile the moons' orbital properties and geological diversity, and self-consistently produce a recent ocean on Enceladus."
740,C,"Cool subdwarfs are metal-poor low-mass stars that formed during the early stages of the evolution of our Galaxy. Because they are relatively rare in the vicinity of the Sun, we know of few cool subdwarfs in the solar neighbourhood, and none for which both the mass and the radius are accurately determined. This hampers our understanding of stars at the low-mass end of the main sequence. Here we report the discovery of SDSSJ235524.29+044855.7 as an eclipsing binary containing a cool subdwarf star, with a white dwarf companion. From the light curve and the radial-velocity curve of the binary we determine the mass and the radius of the cool subdwarf and we derive its effective temperature and luminosity by analysing its spectral energy distribution. Our results validate the theoretical relations between mass, radius, effective temperature and luminosity for low-mass, low-metallicity stars."
741,C,"Nearly all young stars are initially surrounded by 'protoplanetary' disks of gas and dust, and in the case of single stars at least 30% of these disks go on to form planets(1). The process of protoplanetary disk formation can result in initial misalignments, where the disk orbital plane is different from the stellar equator in single-star systems, or different from the binary orbital plane in systems with two stars(2). A quirk of the dynamics means that initially misaligned 'circumbinary' disks-those that surround two stars-are predicted to evolve to one of two possible stable configurations: one where the disk and binary orbital planes are coplanar and one where they are perpendicular (a 'polar' configuration)(3-5). Previous work has found coplanar circumbinary disks(6), but no polar examples were known until now. Here, we report the first discovery of a protoplanetary circumbinary disk in the polar configuration, supporting the predictions that such disks should exist. The disk shows some characteristics that are similar to disks around single stars, and that are attributed to dust growth. Thus, the first stages of planet formation appear able to proceed in polar circumbinary disks."
742,C,"Astrophysical shocks at all scales, from those in the heliosphere up to cosmological shock waves, are typically 'collisionless', because the thickness of their jump region is much shorter than the collisional mean free path. Across these jumps, electrons, protons and ions are expected to be heated at different temperatures. Supernova remnants (SNRs) are ideal targets to study collisionless processes because of their bright post-shock emission and fast shocks, but the actual dependence of the post-shock temperature on the particle mass is still widely debated(1). We tackle this longstanding issue through the analysis of deep multi-epoch and high-resolution observations, made with the Chandra X-ray telescope, of the youngest nearby supernova remnant, SN 1987A. We introduce a data analysis method by studying the observed spectra in close comparison with a dedicated full three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulation that self-consistently reproduces the broadening of the spectral lines of many ions together. We measure the post-shock temperature of protons and ions through comparison of the model with observations. Our results show that the ratio of ion temperature to proton temperature is always significantly higher than one and increases linearly with the ion mass for a wide range of masses and shock parameters."
743,C,"Accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) can exhibit variable emission across the electromagnetic spectrum and over a broad range of timescales. The variability of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the ultraviolet and optical is usually at the few tens of per cent level over timescales of hours to weeks(1). Recently, rare, more dramatic changes to the emission from accreting SMBHs have been observed, including tidal disruption events(2-5), 'changing look' AGNs(6-9) and other extreme variability objects(10,11). The physics behind the 're-ignition', enhancement and 'shut-down' of accretion onto SMBHs is not entirely understood. Here we present a rapid increase in ultraviolet-optical emission in the centre of a nearby galaxy, marking the onset of sudden increased accretion onto a SMBH. The optical spectrum of this flare, dubbed AT 2017bgt, exhibits a mix of emission features. Some are typical of luminous, unobscured AGNs, but others are likely driven by Bowen fluorescence-robustly linked here with high-velocity gas in the vicinity of the accreting SMBH. The spectral features and increased ultraviolet flux show little evolution over a period of at least 14 months. This disfavours the tidal disruption of a star as their origin, and instead suggests a longer-term event of intensified accretion. Together with two other recently reported events with similar properties, we define a new class of SMBH-related flares. This has important implications for the classification of different types of enhanced accretion onto SMBHs."
744,C,"Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the strongest explosions in the Universe since the Big Bang. They are believed to be produced either in the formation of black holes at the end of massive star evolution(1-3) or the merging of compact objects(4). Spectral and timing properties of GRBs suggest that the observed bright gamma-rays are produced in the most relativistic jets in the Universe(4); however, the physical properties (especially the structure and magnetic topologies) of the jets are still not well known, despite several decades of studies. It is widely believed that precise measurements of the polarization properties of GRBs should provide crucial information on the highly relativistic jets(5). As a result, there have been many reports of GRB polarization measurements with diverse results (see ref. (6)); however, many such measurements suffer from substantial uncertainties, most of which are systematic (ref. (7) and the references therein). After the first successful measurements by the Gamma-Ray Burst Polarimeter (GAP) and Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) instruments(8-10), here we report a statistically meaningful sample of precise polarization measurements, obtained with the dedicated GRB polarimeter POLAR onboard China's Tiangong-2 space laboratory. Our results suggest that the gamma-ray emission is at most polarized at a level lower than some popular models have predicted, although our results also show intrapulse evolution of the polarization angle. This indicates that the low polarization degrees could be due to an evolving polarization angle during a GRB."
745,C,"Quasar outflows carry mass, momentum and energy into the surrounding environment, and have long been considered a potential key factor in regulating the growth of supermassive black holes and the evolution of their host galaxies(1-4). A crucial parameter for understanding the origin of these outflows and measuring their influence on their host galaxies is the distance R between the outflow gas and the galaxy centre(5,6). Although R has been measured in a number of individual galaxies(7-15), its distribution remains unknown. Here we report the distributions of R and the kinetic luminosities of quasar outflows, using the statistical properties of broad absorption line variability in a sample of 915 quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The mean and standard deviation of the distribution of R are 10(1.4 +/- 0.5) parsecs. The typical outflow distance in this sample is tens of parsecs, which is beyond the theoretically predicted location (0.01 to 0.1 parsecs) at which the accretion disk line-driven wind is launched(16,17), but is smaller than the scales of most outflows that are derived using the excited-state absorption lines(7-14). The typical value of the mass flow rate is tens to a hundred solar masses per year, or several times the accretion rate. The typical kinetic-to-bolometric luminosity ratio is a few per cent, indicating that outflows are energetic enough to influence the evolution of their host galaxies."
746,C,"The concordance model (Lambda cold dark matter (Lambda CDM) model, where Lambda is the cosmological constant) reproduces the main current cosmological observations(1-4) assuming the validity of general relativity at all scales and epochs and the presence of CDM and of Lambda, equivalent to dark energy with a constant density in space and time. However, the Lambda CDM model is poorly tested in the redshift interval between the farthest observed type Ia supernovae(5) and the cosmic microwave background. We present measurements of the expansion rate of the Universe based on a Hubble diagram of quasars. Quasars are the most luminous persistent sources in the Universe, observed up to redshifts of z approximate to 7.5 (refs. (6,7)). We estimate their distances following a method developed by our group(8-10), based on the X-ray and ultraviolet emission of the quasars. The distance modulus/redshift relation of quasars at z < 1.4 is in agreement with that of supernovae and with the concordance model. However, a deviation from the Lambda CDM model emerges at higher redshift, with a statistical significance of similar to 4 sigma. If an evolution of the dark energy equation of state is allowed, the data suggest dark energy density increasing with time."
747,C,"Coronal mass ejections (CMEs), often associated with flares(1-3), are the most powerful magnetic phenomena occurring on the Sun. Stars show magnetic activity levels up to ten thousand times higher(4), and CME effects on stellar physics and circumstellar environments are predicted to be substantial(5-9). However, stellar CMEs remain observationally unexplored. Using time-resolved high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of a stellar flare on the active star HR 9024 observed with the High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer onboard the Chandra X-ray Observatory space telescope, we distinctly detected Doppler shifts in S xvi, Si xiv and Mg xii lines that indicate upward and downward motions of hot plasmas (around 10-25 MK) within the flaring loop, with velocities of 100-400 km s(-1), in agreement with a model of a flaring magnetic tube. Most notably, we also detected a later blueshift in the O viii line that reveals an upward motion, with velocity 90 +/- 30 km s(-1), of cool plasma (about 4 MK), that we ascribe to a CME coupled to the flare. From this evidence we were able to derive a CME mass of 1. 2(-0.8)(+2.6) x 10(21) g and a CME kinetic energy of 5. 2(-3.6)(+27.7) x 10(34) erg. These values provide clues in the extrapolation of the solar case to higher activity levels in other stars, suggesting that CMEs could indeed be a major cause of mass and angular momentum loss."
748,C,"Newly forming protoplanets are expected to create cavities and substructures in young, gas-rich protoplanetary disks(1-3), but they are difficult to detect as they could be confused with disk features affected by advanced image analysis techniques(4,5). Recently, a planet was discovered inside the gap of the transitional disk of the T Tauri star PDS 70(6,7). Here, we report on the detection of strong Ha emission from two distinct locations in the PDS 70 system, one corresponding to the previously discovered planet PDS 70 b, which confirms the earlier Ha detection(8), and another located close to the outer edge of the gap, coinciding with a previously identified bright dust spot in the disk and with a small opening in a ring of molecular emission(6,7,9). We identify this second Ha peak as a second protoplanet in the PDS 70 system. The Ha emission spectra of both protoplanets indicate ongoing accretion onto the protoplanets(10,11), which appear to be near a 2: 1 mean motion resonance. Our observations show that adaptive-optics-assisted, medium-resolution integral field spectroscopy with MUSE12 targeting accretion signatures will be a powerful way to trace ongoing planet formation in transitional disks at different stages of their evolution. Finding more young planetary systems in mean motion resonance would give credibility to the Grand Tack hypothesis in which Jupiter and Saturn migrated in a resonance orbit during the early formation period of our Solar System(13)."
749,C,"Titan, Saturn's largest moon, hosts lakes and seas of liquid hydrocarbons at its poles(1). General circulation models demonstrate that regional evaporation and precipitation rates of methane are likely to change with the seasons (Titan's year is 29.5 Earth years) and evolve on a geological timescale (similar to 10(5) Earth years)(2-4). Cassini observations suggest shoreline recession at a few south polar lakes during local summer(5), but similar seasonal changes have yet to be observed at the north pole where lakes are larger and more numerous(6,7). We present three 'phantom lakes' that appear to be north polar surface liquids in winter observations by Cassini RADAR but that are inconsistent with lakes in infrared images obtained up to seven years later, after vernal equinox, suggesting that the liquids were removed in between. If this were the case, the phantom lakes could be interpreted as shallow ponds, with either a pure methane composition or a regolith porous enough to remove the less volatile ethane. These phantom lakes provide observational constraints on removal timescales for surface liquids at Titan's north pole. The location, size and longevity of surface liquid reservoirs affect sediment processing(7), seasonal weather(8), climate evolution(9), and even, perhaps, their habitability(10). As solubility of the possible non-polar mixtures is generally low, short-lived lakes might be nutrient-poor(10) and thus have low astrobiological potential."
750,C,"The angular size of a star is a critical factor in determining its basic properties(1). Direct measurement of stellar angular diameters is difficult: at interstellar distances stars are generally too small to resolve by any individual imaging telescope. This fundamental limitation can be overcome by studying the diffraction pattern in the shadow cast when an asteroid occults a star(2), but only when the photometric uncertainty is smaller than the noise added by atmospheric scintillation(3). Atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes used for particle astrophysics observations have not generally been exploited for optical astronomy due to the modest optical quality of the mirror surface. However, their large mirror area makes them well suited for such high-time-resolution precision photometry measurements(4). Here we report two occultations of stars observed by the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS)(5) Cherenkov telescopes with millisecond sampling, from which we are able to provide a direct measurement of the occulted stars' angular diameter at the <= 0.1 mas scale. This is a resolution never achieved before with optical measurements and represents an order of magnitude improvement over the equivalent lunar occultation method(6). We compare the resulting stellar radius with empirically derived estimates from temperature and brightness measurements, confirming the latter can be biased for stars with ambiguous stellar classifications."
751,C,"Almost all massive stars have bound stellar companions, existing in binaries or higher-order multiples(1-5). While binarity is theorized to be an essential feature of how massive stars form(6), essentially all information about such properties is derived from observations of already formed stars, whose orbital properties may have evolved since birth. Little is known about binarity during formation stages. Here we report high-angular-resolution observations of 1.3 mm continuum and H30 alpha recombination line emission, which reveal a massive protobinary with apparent separation of 180 au at the centre of the massive star-forming region IRAS 07299-1651. From the line-of-sight velocity difference of 9.5 km s(-1) of the two protostars, the binary is estimated to have a minimum total mass of 18 solar masses, consistent with several other metrics, and maximum period of 570 yr, assuming a circular orbit. The H30 alpha line from the primary protostar shows kinematics consistent with rotation along a ring of radius of 12 au. The observations indicate that disk fragmentation at several hundred astronomical units may have formed the binary, and much smaller disks are feeding the individual protostars."
752,C,"Primordial black holes (PBHs) have long been suggested as a viable candidate for the elusive dark matter. The abundance of such PBHs has been constrained using a number of astrophysical observations, except for a hitherto unexplored mass window of M-PBH = [10(-14), 10(-9)] solar masses. Here we carry out a dense-cadence, 7-hour-long observation of M31 with the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) to search for microlensing of stars in M31 by PBHs lying in the halo regions of the Milky Way and M31. Given our simultaneous monitoring of tens of millions of stars in M31, if such light PBHs make up a significant fraction of dark matter, we expect to find many microlensing events. However, we identify only a single candidate event, which translates into stringent upper bounds on the abundance of PBHs in the mass range M-PBH similar or equal to [10(-11), 10(-6)] solar masses."
753,C,"GN-z11 was photometrically selected as a luminous star-forming galaxy candidate at redshift z > 10 on the basis of Hubble Space Telescope imaging data(1). Follow-up Hubble Space Telescope near-infrared grism observations detected a continuum break that was explained as the Ly alpha break corresponding to z=11.09(-0.12)(+0.08) (ref.(2)). However, its accurate redshift remained unclear. Here we report a probable detection of three ultraviolet emission lines from GN-z11, which can be interpreted as the [C III] lambda 1907, C III] lambda 1909 doublet and O III] lambda 1666 at z = 10.957 +/- 0.001 (when the Universe was only similar to 420 Myr old, or similar to 3% of its current age). This is consistent with the redshift of the previous grism observations, supporting GN-z11 as the most distant galaxy known to date. Its ultraviolet lines probably originate from dense ionized gas that is rarely seen at low redshifts, and its strong [C III] and C III] emission is partly due to an active galactic nucleus or enhanced carbon abundance. GN-z11 is luminous and young, yet moderately massive, implying a rapid build-up of stellar mass in the past. Future facilities will be able to find the progenitors of such galaxies at higher redshift and probe the cosmic epoch at the beginning of reionization."
754,C,"The Almahata Sitta 202 meteorite fragment hosts evidence of aqueous alteration at intermediate pressures and temperatures, indicative of a hitherto unknown Ceres-sized parent body. Such intermediate conditions, also seen in the Allende meteorite, might have been more common than our biased meteorite collection indicates. Carbonaceous chondrite meteorites record the earliest stages of Solar System geological activities and provide insight into their parent bodies' histories. Some carbonaceous chondrites are volumetrically dominated by hydrated minerals, providing evidence for low-temperature, low-pressure aqueous alteration(1). Others are dominated by anhydrous minerals and textures that indicate high-temperature metamorphism in the absence of aqueous fluids(1). Evidence of hydrous metamorphism at intermediate pressures and temperatures in carbonaceous chondrite parent bodies has been virtually absent. Here we show that an ungrouped, aqueously altered carbonaceous chondrite fragment (numbered 202) from the Almahata Sitta (AhS) meteorite contains an assemblage of minerals, including amphibole, that reflect fluid-assisted metamorphism at intermediate temperatures and pressures on the parent asteroid. Amphiboles are rare in carbonaceous chondrites, having only been identified previously as a trace component in Allende (CV3(oxA)) chondrules(2). Formation of these minerals would require prolonged metamorphism in a large (about 640-1,800 kilometres in diameter) asteroid that is as yet unknown. Because Allende and AhS 202 represent different asteroidal parent bodies, intermediate conditions may have been more widespread in the early Solar System than is recognized from known carbonaceous chondrite meteorites, which are likely to represent a biased sampling."
755,C,"The recent Planck Legacy 2018 release has confirmed the presence of an enhanced lensing amplitude in cosmic microwave background power spectra compared with that predicted in the standard ? cold dark matter model, where ? is the cosmological constant. A closed Universe can provide a physical explanation for this effect, with the Planck cosmic microwave background spectra now preferring a positive curvature at more than the 99% confidence level. Here, we further investigate the evidence for a closed Universe from Planck, showing that positive curvature naturally explains the anomalous lensing amplitude, and demonstrating that it also removes a well-known tension in the Planck dataset concerning the values of cosmological parameters derived at different angular scales. We show that since the Planck power spectra prefer a closed Universe, discordances higher than generally estimated arise for most of the local cosmological observables, including baryon acoustic oscillations. The assumption of a flat Universe could therefore mask a cosmological crisis where disparate observed properties of the Universe appear to be mutually inconsistent. Future measurements are needed to clarify whether the observed discordances are due to undetected systematics, or to new physics or simply are a statistical fluctuation. The standard cosmological model assumes a flat Universe, but some model inconsistencies appear when curvature is allowed, as supported by the latest Planck Legacy 2018 power spectra. Is it time to consider new physics?"
756,C,"The directions of the galaxy angular momenta can be predicted from the initial conditions of the early Universe through the tidal torque. In simulations, these directions are well preserved through cosmic time, consistent with expectations of angular momentum conservation. We find evidence, statistically significant at similar to 3 sigma, of correlation between observed oriented directions of galaxy angular momentum vectors and their predictions based on the initial density field reconstructed from the positions of Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies. This study presents direct evidence for a correlation between directions of galaxy angular momenta and cosmic initial conditions, and opens a way to use measurements of galaxy spins to probe fundamental physics in the early Universe."
757,C,"The Milky Way galaxy is surrounded by a circumgalactic medium(1) that may play a key role in galaxy evolution as the source of gas for star formation and a repository of metals and energy produced by star formation and nuclear activity(2). The circumgalactic medium may also be a repository for baryons seen in the early universe, but undetected locally(3). The circumgalactic medium has an ionized component at temperatures near 2 x 10(6) K studied primarily in the soft-X-ray band(4,5). Here we report a survey of the southern Galactic sky with a soft-X-ray spectrometer optimized to study diffuse soft-X-ray emission(6). The X-ray emission is best fitted with a disk-like model based on the radial profile of the surface density of molecular hydrogen, a tracer of star formation, suggesting that the X-ray emission is predominantly from hot plasma produced via stellar feedback. Strong variations in the X-ray emission on angular scales of similar to 10 degrees indicate that the circumgalactic medium is clumpy. Addition of an extended, and possibly massive, halo component is needed to match the halo density inferred from other observations(7-9)."
758,C,"Near-Earth space is becoming increasingly privatized, with the number of satellites in low-Earth orbits predicted to grow dramatically from about 2,000 at present to over 100,000 in the next decade due to the launch of planned satellite constellations. In addition to their direct impact on astronomy, the manner and pace of 'occupying' near-Earth space raises the risk of repeating the mistakes of colonization on a cosmic scale. We must consider the impact of satellite constellations, and related future initiatives, on the essential human right to dark skies and on cultural sky traditions across all peoples. We must also include all stakeholders for near-Earth space in the process of developing new policies for space treaties and planetary protection, the consequences of which will reach far beyond this century. We advocate for a radical shift in the policy framework of international regulatory bodies towards the view of space as an ancestral global commons that contains the heritage and future of humanity's scientific and cultural practices. In the context of near-Earth space becoming increasingly privatized and crowded due to the launch of satellite constellations, space must be viewed as an ancestral global commons that contains the heritage and future of humanity's scientific and cultural practices."
759,C,"Measurements of trace gases in planetary atmospheres help us explore chemical conditions different to those on Earth. Our nearest neighbour, Venus, has cloud decks that are temperate but hyperacidic. Here we report the apparent presence of phosphine (PH3) gas in Venus's atmosphere, where any phosphorus should be in oxidized forms. Single-line millimetre-waveband spectral detections (quality up to similar to 15 sigma) from the JCMT and ALMA telescopes have no other plausible identification. Atmospheric PH(3)at similar to 20 ppb abundance is inferred. The presence of PH(3)is unexplained after exhaustive study of steady-state chemistry and photochemical pathways, with no currently known abiotic production routes in Venus's atmosphere, clouds, surface and subsurface, or from lightning, volcanic or meteoritic delivery. PH(3)could originate from unknown photochemistry or geochemistry, or, by analogy with biological production of PH(3)on Earth, from the presence of life. Other PH(3)spectral features should be sought, while in situ cloud and surface sampling could examine sources of this gas."
760,C,"In situ measurements from the Rosetta spacecraft reveal the presence of atomic emissions close to comet 67P's nucleus. Such emissions are due to dissociative excitation of molecules by the interaction with the solar wind, identifying them as a form of aurora. Having a nucleus darker than charcoal, comets are usually detected from Earth through the emissions from their coma. The coma is an envelope of gas that forms through the sublimation of ices from the nucleus as the comet gets closer to the Sun. In the far-ultraviolet portion of the spectrum, observations of comae have revealed the presence of atomic hydrogen and oxygen emissions. When observed over large spatial scales as seen from Earth, such emissions are dominated by resonance fluorescence pumped by solar radiation. Here, we analyse atomic emissions acquired close to the cometary nucleus by the Rosetta spacecraft and reveal their auroral nature. To identify their origin, we undertake a quantitative multi-instrument analysis of these emissions by combining coincident neutral gas, electron and far-ultraviolet observations. We establish that the atomic emissions detected from Rosetta around comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko at large heliocentric distances result from the dissociative excitation of cometary molecules by accelerated solar-wind electrons (and not by electrons produced from photo-ionization of cometary molecules). Like the discrete aurorae at Earth and Mars, this cometary aurora is driven by the interaction of the solar wind with the local environment. We also highlight how the oxygen line Oiat wavelength 1,356 A could be used as a tracer of solar-wind electron variability."
761,C,"Flares from K and M dwarf stars drive change, and sustain an altered atmospheric chemistry, in orbiting rocky planets, according to a suite of three-dimensional climate models. The atmospheres of rocky planets around G dwarfs rapidly return to their pre-flare states, however. Low-mass stars show evidence of vigorous magnetic activity in the form of large flares and coronal mass ejections. Such space weather events may have important ramifications for the habitability and observational fingerprints of exoplanetary atmospheres. Here, using a suite of three-dimensional coupled chemistry-climate model simulations, we explore effects of time-dependent stellar activity on rocky planet atmospheres orbiting G, K and M dwarf stars. We employ observed data from the MUSCLES campaign and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and test a range of rotation period, magnetic field strength and flare frequency assumptions. We find that recurring flares drive the atmospheres of planets around K and M dwarfs into chemical equilibria that substantially deviate from their pre-flare regimes, whereas the atmospheres of G dwarf planets quickly return to their baseline states. Interestingly, simulated O-2-poor and O-2-rich atmospheres experiencing flares produce similar mesospheric nitric oxide abundances, suggesting that stellar flares can highlight otherwise undetectable chemical species. Applying a radiative transfer model to our chemistry-climate model results, we find that flare-driven transmission features of bio-indicating chemical species, such as nitrogen dioxide, nitrous oxide and nitric acid, show particular promise for detection by future instruments."
762,C,"The masses of supermassive black holes are observed to increase with either the total mass or the mean (random) velocity of the stars in their host galaxies. The origin of these correlations remains elusive due to observational systematics and biases that severely limit our knowledge of the local demography of supermassive black holes. Here, we show that the large-scale spatial distribution of local active galactic nuclei (AGN) can constrain the shape and normalization of the black hole-stellar mass relation, thus bypassing resolution-related observational biases. In turn, our results can set more stringent constraints on the AGN radiative efficiency, epsilon. For currently accepted values of the AGN obscured fractions and bolometric corrections, our estimated local supermassive black hole mass density favours mean epsilon values of similar to 10-20%, suggesting that the vast majority of supermassive black holes are spinning moderately to rapidly. With large-scale AGN surveys coming online, our methodology will enable even tighter constraints on the fundamental parameters that regulate the growth of supermassive black holes."
763,C,"The Large Magellanic Cloud is the most massive satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, with an estimated mass exceeding a tenth of the mass of the Milky Way(1-5). Just past its closest approach of about 50 kpc, and flying past the Milky Way at an astonishing speed of 327 km s(-1) (ref. (6)), the Large Magellanic Cloud can affect our Galaxy in a number of ways, including dislodging the Milky Way disk from the Galactic centre of mass(7-9). Here, we report evidence that the Milky Way disk is moving with respect to stellar tracers in the outer halo in a direction that points at an earlier location on the Large Magellanic Cloud trajectory. The resulting reflex motion is detected in the kinematics of outer halo stars and Milky Way satellite galaxies with accurate distances, proper motions and line-of-sight velocities. Our results indicate that dynamical models of our Galaxy cannot neglect gravitational perturbations induced by the Large Magellanic Cloud infall, nor can observations of the stellar halo be treated in a reference frame that does not correct for disk reflex motion. Future spectroscopic surveys of the stellar halo combined with Gaia astrometry will allow for sophisticated modelling of the Large Magellanic Cloud trajectory across the Milky Way, constraining the dark matter distribution in both galaxies with unprecedented detail. The Milky Way disk is found to be moving with respect to the outer halo of the Galaxy as a result of the gravitational pull of the Large Magellanic Cloud as it falls into the Milky Way. Dynamical models of our Galaxy need to take this effect into account."
764,C,"Fast radio bursts are millisecond-duration, bright radio signals (fluence 0.1-100 Jy ms) emitted from extragalactic sources of unknown physical origin. The recent CHIME/FRB and STARE2 detection of an extremely bright (fluence similar to MJy ms) radio burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 supports the hypothesis that (at least some) fast radio bursts are emitted by magnetars at cosmological distances. In follow-up observations totalling 522.7 h on source, we detect two bright radio bursts with fluences of 112 +/- 22 Jy ms and 24 +/- 5 Jy ms, respectively. Both bursts appear to be affected by interstellar scattering and we measure significant linear and circular polarization for the fainter burst. The bursts are separated in time by similar to 1.4 s, suggesting a non-Poissonian, clustered emission process-similar to those seen in some repeating fast radio bursts. Together with the burst reported by CHIME/FRB and STARE2, as well as a much fainter burst seen by FAST (fluence 60 mJy ms), our observations demonstrate that SGR 1935+2154 can produce bursts with apparent energies spanning roughly seven orders of magnitude, and that the burst rate is comparable across this range. This raises the question of whether these four bursts arise from similar physical processes, and whether the fast radio burst population distribution extends to very low energies (similar to 10(30) erg, isotropic equivalent)."
765,E,"This article provides the first empirical study focused exclusively on the information intermediary role in disadvantaged (socioeconomic) and dependent (support) circumstances. We report findings from interviews and focus groups with 49 UK state and voluntary sector professionals providing support to young (<21) mothers from areas of multiple deprivations. We evidence an important information intermediary role with three key contributions to information behaviors in disadvantaged and dependent circumstances. Intermediaries: facilitate information needs recognition, and consider purposeful action within problematic situations; are a key source of information in themselves, and a key integrative connection to other external sources not otherwise accessed; and tailor and personalize information for relevance, and communicate via incremental and recursive cycles that take into account learning needs. We provide parameters for a theory of information intermediary intervention to guide future examination of an important and understudied role; and conceptualize important theoretical relationships between information behavior and social capital, and in particular shared concepts of social integration, and the progressive and integrative intermediary role within. Our findings have significant practical implications for public health policy and digital health strategies, as they evidence an important human information intermediary role among an at-risk group, with implications for disadvantaged and vulnerable populations more broadly."
766,E,"Word segmentation is the task of inserting or deleting word boundary characters in order to separate character sequences that correspond to words in some language. In this article we propose an approach based on a beam search algorithm and a language model working at the byte/character level, the latter component implemented either as an n-gram model or a recurrent neural network. The resulting system analyzes the text input with no word boundaries one token at a time, which can be a character or a byte, and uses the information gathered by the language model to determine if a boundary must be placed in the current position or not. Our aim is to use this system in a preprocessing step for a microtext normalization system. This means that it needs to effectively cope with the data sparsity present on this kind of texts. We also strove to surpass the performance of two readily available word segmentation systems: The well-known and accessible Word Breaker by Microsoft, and the Python module WordSegment by Grant Jenks. The results show that we have met our objectives, and we hope to continue to improve both the precision and the efficiency of our system in the future."
767,E,"Our consumption of online information is mediated by filtering, ranking, and recommendation algorithms that introduce unintentional biases as they attempt to deliver relevant and engaging content. It has been suggested that our reliance on online technologies such as search engines and social media may limit exposure to diverse points of view and make us vulnerable to manipulation by disinformation. In this article, we mine a massive data set of web traffic to quantify two kinds of bias: (i) homogeneity bias, which is the tendency to consume content from a narrow set of information sources, and (ii) popularity bias, which is the selective exposure to content from top sites. Our analysis reveals different bias levels across several widely used web platforms. Search exposes users to a diverse set of sources, while social media traffic tends to exhibit high popularity and homogeneity bias. When we focus our analysis on traffic to news sites, we find higher levels of popularity bias, with smaller differences across applications. Overall, our results quantify the extent to which our choices of online systems confine us inside social bubbles."
768,E,"Sentiment analysis has become a very important tool for analysis of social media data. There are several methods developed, covering distinct aspects of the problem and disparate strategies. However, no single technique fits well in all cases or for all data sources. Supervised approaches may be able to adapt to specific situations, but require manually labeled training, which is very cumbersome and expensive to acquire, mainly for a new application. In this context, we propose to combine several popular and effective state-of-the-practice sentiment analysis methods by means of an unsupervised bootstrapped strategy. One of our main goals is to reduce the large variability (low stability) of the unsupervised methods across different domains. The experimental results demonstrate that our combined method (aka, 10SENT) improves the effectiveness of the classification task, considering thirteen different data sets. Also, it tackles the key problem of cross-domain low stability and produces the best (or close to best) results in almost all considered contexts, without any additional costs (e.g., manual labeling). Finally, we also investigate a transfer learning approach for sentiment analysis to gather additional (unsupervised) information for the proposed approach, and we show the potential of this technique to improve our results."
769,E,"The use of indicators and metrics for research evaluation purposes is well-documented; however, less is known about their use by individual scholars. With a focus on the social sciences, this article contributes to the existing literature on indicators and metrics use in fields with diverse publication practices. Scholars in Australia and Sweden were asked about their use and reasons for using metrics. A total of 581 completed surveys were analyzed to generate descriptive statistics, with textual analysis performed on comments provided to open questions. While just under half of the participant group had used metrics, the Australians reported use in twice the proportion of their Swedish peers. Institutional policies and processes were frequently associated with use, and the scholars' comments suggest a high level of awareness of some metrics as well as strategic behavior in demonstrating research performance. There is also evidence of tensions between scholars' research evaluation environment and their disciplinary values and publication practices."
770,F,"The purpose of this paper is to appoint the causality between economic activity in the sector of distributive trade and the economic growth of 28 European Union nations. Specifically, it examines the impact of changes in turnover per employee in the distributive trade sector in EU member states on the tangible economic growth rate. The determination to adopt this approach stems from the fact that existing studies mainly explore indirect relationship between economic activities in distributive trade and economic development, with less focus on the direct impact of distributive trade on economic growth. The paper utilizes information for the period from 2008 to 2015. The research relies on multiple regression model, with the Hausman test its robustness. The results indicate that a hike in turnover per employee in the distributive trade sector by 10 euros per year in one EU member state increases its real economic growth rate by 0.15% in that same year. The significance of the made results is reflected in the fact that the survey takes into account the last economic crisis, and highlights negative effects of final consumption expenditure of general government % GDP on the tangible economic growth rate in EU member states."
771,F,"Despite the strong public interest in the accountability and efficiency in education spending on higher education institutions (HEIs) in Lithuania, there are currently no existing studies which have examined the impact of HEIs on the country's economy. In the present study, we have used a disaggregated input-output table for Lithuania's tertiary education institutions in order to determine the output value added to the local economy by the presence of HEIs. The results of the study have revealed that HEIs contribute to the Lithuanian economy in the period of (2010-2016), with the average of gross domestic output (GDP) of 298,48 mln. euros. The present study is the first of its kind to use input-output table evaluate the impact of HEIs on Lithuania's economy, and its results could be of significant value to the current policy debates regarding the status of higher education in Lithuania."
772,F,"This research aims to determine factors affecting and the level of their influence on organizational structure, operating mechanism and audit quality in the Vietnamese market. In this paper, the methodology used by the authors is mixed method. Combination of the qualitative research method and the quantitative research method on the basis of meta-analysis and synthesis of existing information from various sources and results of interviews carried out in early 2018 using a questionnaire for 270 auditors who now work at audit firms in Vietnam. The results of the research showed that factors affecting the operating mechanism of audit firms include the legal system, quality control and internal corporate governance. Factors affecting the audit quality are the organizational structure and the operating mechanism of audit firms. Among these factors, the operating mechanism has the greatest impact on and plays a decisive role in the audit quality. In addition, the research showed that factors affecting the organizational structure of audit firms in Vietnam are unobvious."
773,F,"This paper investigates the relationship between money/credit growth and house price inflation for a sample of twelve developed countries. The novel application of the continuous wavelet transform showed significant but time-varying linkages between these two variables. During quantitative easing in the United States and the United Kingdom, growth of respectively broad money and bank credit was leading house price inflation for the 2-8 years cycle. In contrast to this, the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank either did not assign a separate role to house prices in their reaction functions or the two central banks were not capable to significantly increase house prices by extending money/credit during the business cycle. The significant co-movements of financial variables and house prices around booming episodes warn us that a new asset price boom might appear within the length of a business cycle as a consequence of overly expansionary monetary policy. In the euro area, the significant, long run, and close to a one-for-one link between growth of M3 and house price inflation is an argument for the monetary pillar of the European Central Bank. The present study contributes significantly to the literature by introducing a novel application of a continuous wavelet transform to study the housing prices in relation to money, credit and quantitative easing. The article uses a long-term dataset covering a period of almost half a century to analyse their varying relationship in the short-run to the long-run and from the historical perspective."
774,F,"Polish government introduced crucial changes concerning conditions of the pension funds functioning in the years 2011-2014. This article focuses on explaining the impact of these political decisions on efficiency of investment fund market in Poland. Therefore, the article aims (1) to find out if changing in functioning of pension funds also affected the efficiency of mutual funds which provide stable growth investment policy (i.e. similar investment strategy as pension funds) and (2) to check which type of investment funds, pension or mutual, were more efficient in the sense of returns and risks under new regulations. The analysis is provided for selected mutual funds using daily, weekly and monthly returns. The whole period of analysis, years 2009-2015, is divided into six sub-periods according to the three events, that essentially changed the functioning of the pension funds. Statistical tests for in pairs comparisons of returns and risks, and ratios for investment efficiency evaluation were applied. Findings show that pension funds performed better than mutual funds which are managed by the same company. More, the changes of the rules for pension funds' functioning caused an increase of risk and a decrease of efficiency of the considered investment funds' portfolios."
775,F,"The online fashion and textile sector is growing in recent years, becoming one of the online sectors with the highest volume of business. However, the bibliography on e-service quality and its consequences in this sector has been underdeveloped in the last years. This paper presents a model that incorporates the direct and indirect effects of e-service quality (utilitarian and hedonic experience) on satisfaction and loyalty of two segments of customers: transactional and online experimental customers. This research focuses on six online sale platforms, and it has been tested with data on 405 regular customers. The study also develops a model that incorporates the direct and indirect effect of e-service experiences on satisfaction, positive WOM, repurchase intention and price tolerance. The findings indicate that direct and indirect effects of e-service quality on satisfaction and loyalty are different for each segment of customers. While utilitarian quality is more relevant for those customers that only search for information, hedonic quality is especially significant for experiential customers."
776,F,"The traditional loans pricing methods are usually based on risk measures of individual loan's characteristics without considering the correlation between the defaults of different loans and the contribution of individual loans to the entire loan portfolio. In this study, using account-level loans data of 2010-2016 abstracted from 2 databases kindly provided by a Chinese commercial bank, the authors choose Archimedean Copula to fit the default relationship between loans, combined with the loss distribution function constructed to measure the economic capital of the loan portfolio, to propose a loan pricing method that is more suitable for measuring the unique risk characteristic of SMEs loans. Empirical evidence shows that compared with the traditional loan pricing model, this new proposed one, requiring lower loan interest rates from customers with higher credit rating, while higher loan interest rates from customers with lower credit rating, could thus be able to provide higher risk-adjusted returns, higher economic capital adequacy ratios, and ultimately stronger banks' capabilities to tolerate risk events. Although there might still be some issues and limitations in the study, the method proposed in this study could be of interest not only to the banks' management, but also to banking regulators as well."
777,F,"A significant number of studies have been made in the area of agricultural economics; however, there is a paucity of work that investigates factors or determinants which influence the financial performance of agro cooperatives. This paper investigates determinants of financial performance for the United States (U.S.) agricultural cooperatives for the period 2009-2017. By using the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) database, we created a sample of 37 U.S. agro cooperatives. For analysis, we used panel regression analysis as it is suitable to deal with fixed effect or random effect error component presented in the model. Finding states that the U.S. agro cooperatives are found highly sensitive to economic policy uncertainty. The results provide evidence of a negative relationship between size and profitability. Moreover, the impact of growth and capital intensity is also reflected in the return on asset (ROA). In this study, we considered ROA as a proxy for firm performance. Implications and suggestions for further new research are also discussed."
778,F,"This paper(1) aims to develop strategy and policy suggestions to increase the competitiveness of SMEs in the textile industry by analyzing the variables that affect competitiveness and contribute to competitiveness literature by adopting a holistic approach to the analysis of competitiveness variables. A hybrid model composed of Delphi and fuzzy DEMATEL (Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory) methods were used to gather and analyze the competitiveness variables. This led to the identification of the 15 most important of 73 competitiveness variables relevant to SME competitiveness in the textile industry. These variables were analysed and ranked, and their causal relationships were mapped. The results obtained from the model may function as a reference for SME managers aiming to increase their firm's competitive power."
779,F,"The aim of the paper is to define and quantify the differences in employee motivation depending upon the selected regions and the age of employees. The research was carried out in 2017. Sampling unit consisted of 7,594 respondents - employees from the selected eastern European countries, members of the European Union, mainly the Slovak and Czech Republic, as well as selected regions outside the European Union, Russia and China. Data gathered from the questionnaires were evaluated using descriptive statistics and tested by Tukey's HSD at the level of significance of 5%. The ANOVA Variance Analysis was used to compare each sampling unit in relation to the age and the country. Most of the differences in motivation factors were found in the countries of China and Russia. It can be due to different cultural values, especially because of the power gap and the preferred principle of seniority and collectivism in China. Differences in the level of motivation, i.e. motivation factors especially in relation to the age were observed in the analysed regions. Incentive plans for intercultural teams in order to enable employers to choose motivation factors effectively were designed following the conclusions presented in the paper. Fundamental patterns of cultural differences as well as age-related differences predicting motivational preferences can be taken into consideration when selecting the motivation factors."
780,F,"This paper investigates the volatility spillover dynamics between U.S. Bitcoin and financial markets from July 19, 2010 to December 29, 2017. Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) volatility spillover index, Barunik, Kocenda, and Vacha (2017) Spillover Asymmetry Measure, and Barunik and Krehlik (2018) frequency connectedness methodologies are applied to investigate the time varying dynamics of volatility spillover among U.S. Bitcoin and financial markets. The findings of the study indicate the presence of low level of integration and contagion between U.S. Bitcoin and financial markets. Asymmetric nature of volatility spillover is also detected. The connectedness among the U.S. Bitcoin and financial markets is found to be concentrated at high frequency, suggesting that markets process information rapidly. Moreover, the turbulence in Bitcoin market will have insignificant effect on U.S. financial markets. This non-contagion nature of Bitcoin markets provides significant risk hedging and diversification benefits for domestic and foreign investors in the U.S."
781,F,"There are very different outcomes in the literature regarding the influences of corruption on business innovation and also arguments for both """"sanding the wheels"""" and """"greasing the wheels"""" approaches. The main goal pursued in this paper is to broaden the understanding of the corruption influence on business innovation, considering seven representative dimensions of corruption at governmental structures and institutions' level and also four relevant dimensions of business innovation, less approached so far. The originality and relevance of this paper are based on that these seven different dimensions of corruption are targeting three characteristic features of it, as bribery's prevalence, the bribery's spread and the companies' propensity to offer gifts for overcoming the bureaucratic pressures. Moreover, the four different new dimensions of business innovation are targeting the company's propensity for innovating and strengthening its image and the way of connecting with business partners in a changing business environment. Considering an extensive data set for 110 emergent countries from four continents for the period between 2002 and 2014 and using the generalized linear model framework, this research study is emphasizing that corruption at governmental structures and institutional level has a significant negative impact on business innovation, adversely affecting innovation perspectives."
782,F,"The paper focuses on impact of macroeconomic indicators on the development of public debt in Slovakia. The aim of the paper was to identify those macroeconomic indicators which influence the most significantly public debt in Slovakia and to elaborate and verify simple model for public debt prediction. Research was based on the analysis of chosen macroeconomic indicators. Selection of macroeconomic indicators resulted from theoretical knowledge and study of various research papers. Authors used several scientific methods, such as content-causal analysis, comparison, mathematical and statistical methods, including simple linear regression. Macroeconomic indicators, which authors proved to be statistically significant, are GDP growth rate, openness of economy, size of public sector, government bond yields, and unemployment rate. Authors elaborated model of the public debt development in Slovakia by using a simple linear regression model. Regression model was calculated using the data for 1995-2016. Authors confirmed correctness of the model by using data for 2017. Research was limited by the fact, that there are limited data available for analysis (time series of 22 years) because of short existence of independent Slovakia. It will be necessary to continue with the research and to verify correctness of chosen indicators in longer period."
783,F,"Global surveys indicate that employee engagement costs nearly 70 pound billion per year in the UK alone with nascent improvement from 2011 to this date. Recognising employee disengagement as a threat to global socio-economic sustainability, experts and scholars offer CSR and employee-centric leadership as practical solutions. Visionary and servant leadership incite superior employee efforts through fair and ethical work values, but past theory and research show limited research on the micro-processes that link CSR to employee outcomes. This study tested a value-centred model to examine if the two leadership styles and overall fairness can explain the positive relationship between CSR and extra effort. Data analysis of 512 employee self-reports using the structural equation modelling (SEM), the PROCESS approach and other techniques showed that executive's CSR values cue to employee visionary and servant leadership, which influence extra effort both directly and indirectly (through overall fairness). Even though employees strongly endorsed the positive influence of universal visionary prototype, overall fairness was more strongly perceived in servant leadership. The paper offers practical implications for organisational theorists and practitioners."
784,F,"This research has two aims. The first one is to determine how and to what extent the national cultural characteristic of a country plays a role in her entrepreneurship success. The second one is to determine whether culture and economic development levels interact with each other on influencing entrepreneurship success. A consecutive five-year longitudinal study, covering 81 countries is conducted. Longitudinal Random Effect Regression Analysis is used to determine the effects of culture on entrepreneurship rates. Data regarding the cultural dimensions indexes of the countries is obtained from Geert Hofstede website and the entrepreneurship rates from the annual reports of the Global Entrepreneurship and Development Institute. The interaction effect of cultural dimensions and economic development levels on entrepreneurship is analyzed by treating the economic development level is the interacting variable between cultural dimensions and entrepreneurship rates. Economic development levels of the countries are measured by GDP per capita, figures obtained from the World Bank. The findings are that the cultural dimensions Individualism, Long Term Orientation, and Indulgence vs. Restraint influence the entrepreneurship rate in a supportive manner, whereas Masculinity's impact is in a rendering manner. Other dimensions seem to have no significant effect. Although relevant cultural dimensions do interact with economic development levels, their interaction effects are small. This study has several unique contributions to the entrepreneurship literature, such as its longitudinal nature, using all Hofstede Dimensions, applying a very comprehensive entrepreneurship measurement scale, its huge sample size and containing an interactive analysis of culture and economic development level which is very rare in the literature."
785,F,"The purpose of this paper is to explore the process of Cloud Computing adoption within Romanian Small and Medium sized Enterprises in the digital age. Most of the scientific papers related to this topic examine the general outlook of cloud computing implementation in Romania and focus on the use of the afore-mentioned technologies by large scale companies. In order to identify the factors that have an influence over the choice of Romanian SMEs to adopt cloud computing technology, a conceptual model has been set forth. The model's dependent variable is the choice of the company's management to implement cloud computing technologies. Five different independent types of variable structures which have an effect on the adoption of cloud computing within SMEs were identified. The five categories of variables are competition & government, ICT providers & firm departments, employee, manager and technological factors. Each of these categories of determinants encompasses at their turn two or more constructs. An online survey tested the model based on the responses of managers and directors from 198 Romanian SMEs from the cities of Bucharest and Cluj. The validity of the model was performed by completing factor analysis and reliability tests of the data; a logistic regression analysis was deployed to test the research hypotheses. The results emphasized that the managers' know-how on cloud computing and the perceived costs of implementing the technology represent the main components influencing the spreading of cloud computing among Romanian SMEs. This study makes a valuable contribution to the academic environment but to businesses as well. The model can be used to examine the implementation of different innovative applications. Companies which offer cloud computing services could take advantage of the outcomes of this study to expand the degree of cloud service introduction among SMEs."
786,F,"The availabilities of debt for Chinese firms have been increased since 2008 due to the expansionary monetary policies. These policies triggered concerns over the impact of debt financing on firms' technological innovation activities. Based on a sample of 225 listed computer and telecommunications equipment firms in China within 2008-2015, this study explored the effect of debt financing on two types of technological innovation, namely radical and incremental innovation. Specifically, both the direct effect of debt financing on technological innovation and its moderating effect on the relationship between R&D intensity and technological innovation were investigated. Results of this study reveal that radical innovation decreases with debt financing at decreasing rates, while incremental innovation is not affected by debt financing itself. In addition, debt financing interacted with R&D intensity exerts positive effect on both radical and incremental innovation. This study adds meaningful insights to the literature on financing technological innovation and builds a bridge connecting macroeconomic policies to firm activities."
787,F,"The purpose of the study is to provide an assessment of both how consumers adopt mobile tourism apps and how consumers use those apps to orient customer intentions to visit tourism destinations. The technology acceptance model (TAM) is used to explore customer intentions to adopt tourism apps. A survey of 630 tourism respondents found that the e-servicescape environment and e-word-of-mouth communication play major roles in determining intentions to adopt tourism apps and to visit tourism destinations. Perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness tend to be moderators of the effects of the e-servicescape environment and e-word-of-mouth communication on attitudes towards using apps. The results may be important references to conduct further validations, and critical for marketing managers when designing specific criteria to enhance mobile apps and their adoption. The different managerial implications - including apps to differential marketing tools, improving attitudes towards using tourism apps, and segmenting customers in order to design marketing strategies - are considered."
788,F,"This paper investigates the price and service rate decisions in a customer-intensive service in an M/M/1 queue system under the influence of social interactions, where a higher value of the service is perceived if more customers purchase the service. The customer-intensive nature of the service requires a low service speed to maintain its quality, which may increase the congestion of the system. Two cases where customers are either homogeneous or heterogeneous in terms of the customer intensity are considered. It is found that social interactions can always benefit the service provider as more expected revenue can be achieved, and potential profits would be lost if the influence of social interations is ignored. For the case with heterogeneous customers, the optimal price and service rate decisions are solved with or without considering social interaction effect. The study finds the proportions of high and low sensitive customers and the social interaction intensity are critical to the operational decisions and the market coverage strategies. These results offer a better understanding on the interplay between the quality-speed conundrum and the influence of social interactions in customers' purchase behaviour in managing customer-intensive services."
789,G,"Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore factors which mediated or moderated the effect of the Time2bHealthy online program for parents of preschool-aged children on body mass index (BMI) change. Study design: Mediation and moderation analyses of data from a two-arm parallel randomised controlled trial. Methods: Randomisation was conducted after baseline measures. The intervention group received an 11-week online program, and the comparison group received emailed links to information from an evidence-based parenting website. Data on the primary outcome (child BMI), potential mediators (energy intake, fruit and vegetable intake, discretionary food intake, physical activity, screen-time, sleep, child feeding, parent self-efficacy or parent role modelling) and potential moderators (child age, parent age, parent income, parent education or parent living situation) were collected at baseline, 3 months and 6 months. PROCESS macro for SPSS was used to analyse possible mediators and moderators on BMI outcomes. Results: Despite significant food-related outcomes in the main analysis of this trial, no significant mediating or moderating effects were found for any hypothesised mediators or moderators. Conclusions: This study's null results could be explained by the high proportion of children in the healthy weight range, the study period not being long enough to detect change, the multicomponent nature of the intervention or the relatively small number of outcomes measured. Future childhood obesity interventions should continue to explore the effects of mediators and moderators on BMI and consider collecting data on a wide range of mediating and moderating factors to allow for comparison between studies to develop a better understanding of the factors contributing to successful interventions.

790,G,"Objectives: Stunting is a significant cause of poor cognitive performance and lower school achievement. Stunting is observed among pre-school children in several areas in Africa; however, not all children are affected, and children with and without stunting are seen in the same communities. Therefore, this study aimed to identify nutritional and other factors that prevent stunting that may exist in local communities. Study design: This is a prospective cohort study. Methods: Data were extracted from the Health and Demographic Surveillance System conducted in Kwale County, Kenya. The cohort consisted of all households with children less than five years old, within a radius of 2.2 km from a local health centre. A dietary pattern (DP) survey with a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire was conducted on caretakers of children who were voluntary participated from the cohort between June 2012 and August 2012. Using cluster analysis, the children were assigned to a DP group. Logistic regression analysis was applied to calculate the adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of DPs for stunting controlling for other factors. Results: In total, 402 children were included in the analysis. By cluster analysis, three DPs were identified: protein-rich DP; traditional DP; and traditional DP complemented by breastfeeding. The aOR of a child becoming stunted from a normal height during the study period among children who received a traditional DP compared with those who had a protein-rich DP was 2.78 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-7.55). However, the aOR for children who were already stunted at the start of the study and had a traditional DP was 1.49 (95% CI: 0.82-2.72). Increased aORs of stunting were observed among children aged over 12 months compared with children aged 6-11 months, and the effects of DPs were modified by age in months from 12 to 35 months; however, the effects were near the null value for children over 36 months of age, although these were not statistically significant. Conclusions: We found that the traditional DP showed a higher risk for stunting compared with the protein-rich DP, and the most vulnerable age range for stunting was between 12 and 35 months. Interventions to prevent stunting should focus on providing 12- to 35-month-old children with locally available, protein-rich foods. (C) 2019 The Royal Society for Public Health.

791,G,"Objective: A waiting list randomised control trial has shown the Move More Pack, a print-based intervention supported by Internet tools, to improve physical activity levels in cancer survivors; however, one-third of them do not improve from the intervention. The objective of this process evaluation is to understand intervention use, the mechanisms of impact, the perceived benefits and the contextual factors influencing these, identifying for whom it is a useful resource. Methods: The process evaluation used mixed methods, based on guidance from the UK Medical Research Council, including 181 questionnaire responses on intervention use and physical activity improvement over 12 weeks, 56 open-text responses and 17 semistructured interviews. Results: The Move More Pack was suggested to be most useful when delivered towards the start of the cancer journey to those with a positive attitude to fight cancer but with a low level of physical activity, capitalising on a teachable moment. It was suggested that healthcare professionals could support the effective distribution of the Move More Pack. The intervention's printed components were more popular and well used than the Internet tools. Use of the printed intervention components was positively correlated with physical activity improvement but use of the Internet tools was not. Women were more likely to use the intervention's printed components than men. Cancer survivors using the intervention reflected that they had increased confidence and motivation for physical activity and other lifestyle behaviours. Conclusion: The Move More Pack should be offered by healthcare professionals, during cancer treatment, when health is salient, to those with a positive attitude to fight cancer but with low levels of physical activity. Use of the intervention's printed components is more likely to improve physical activity than the Internet tools, and the components are more likely to be used by women. The use of Internet tools to support physical activity improvement in cancer survivors requires further investigation. (C) 2019 The Authors.

792,G,"Objectives: The objective of this study was to evaluate how much attention children pay to health warnings displayed on TV and print advertisements promoting drinks with added sugar, salt, or artificial sweeteners, and processed food products. Study design: The research was conducted in France among 50 children, using an eye-tracking system to record participants' eye movements on TV and print advertisements. Methods: To reproduce the natural exposure conditions to TV commercials, the children were asked to watch a 12-min extract of an animated comedy film with two commercial breaks sandwiched between the extract. For the print ads, all the children were exposed to eight ads. The use of an eye-tracking system gave an objective measurement of the attention paid to the food health warnings. Results: The results show that children exposed to these food product advertisements pay little or no attention to the warnings. Only 18% of the children made more than one eye fixation on the central message of the health warnings (the part displaying the health recommendation) for TV commercials, and almost no attention was given to warnings displayed on the print ads. Conclusions: This study shows that the French authorities should take stronger and more decisive measures to help children adopt healthy behavior because the current health warnings appear insufficient to inform children.

793,G,"Objectives: Many children are insufficiently active, and children with a migration background appear to be even less active and at a higher risk of developing obesity. This study evaluated the weight status, and the frequencies and intensities of objectively assessed physical activity (PA) of children with and without a migration background. Study design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: PA was assessed objectively for 6 days in 273 children (aged 7.1 +/- 0.6 years). In total, 74 children (27%) were classified as having a migration background. PA was grouped in light and moderate-to-vigorous (MVPA) intensities. Body mass index (BMI) percentiles (BMIPCT) were determined. Results: Children without a migration background spent more time in MVPA compared with children with a migration background (138.2 +/- 62.6 vs 121.7 +/- 54.9 min, respectively; P < 0.01). On weekends, time in MVPA decreased significantly for all children (112.3 +/- 66.0 min, P < 0.01), especially for children with a migration background (97.7 +/- 56.7 min, P < 0.01). Children with a migration background displayed significantly higher BMIPCT than children without a migration background (55.7 +/- 29.6 vs 44.3 +/- 26.8, respectively; P < 0.01) and were significantly more often overweight and/or obese (13.5% vs 8.5%, respectively; P < 0.02). Conclusions: Children with a migration background are less physically active and more often overweight, resulting in higher risks of developing secondary diseases. The results of this study should be considered when designing interventions to increase PA in children with a migration background. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

794,G,"Objectives: Cuba is a tobacco-producing country that has been economically isolated as a consequence of an embargo imposed by the USA. It has also experienced a severe economic depression in the 1990s after the withdrawal of support by the former Soviet Union. These characteristics provide a unique opportunity to study the relation between large changes in economic activity, cigarette price and demand for cigarettes in a relatively isolated socialist economy. Study design: This is an observational epidemiological study. Methods: Data were obtained on the annual price of a packet of cigarettes and the mean number of cigarettes consumed per adult living in Cuba from 1980 to 2014. Descriptive and regression analysis were used to explore the relationship between cigarette consumption and price in Cuba. Results: In 1980, the mean price of a packet of cigarettes was 1.53 Cuban peso (CUP) in 1997 prices and the mean annual per capita consumption was 2237 cigarettes. In 2014, the mean price had increased to 5.57 CUP (1997 prices) per packet of cigarettes, and consumption had fallen to 1527 cigarettes per capita. There were significant negative associations between annual cigarette consumption and both price and living through an economic depression. The elasticity was approximately -0.31 with price, and living through an economic depression was also associated with lower consumption of cigarettes (a reduction of 9%, 95% confidence intervals -0.18 to -0.001). Conclusions: Higher cigarette pricing, along with other public health interventions, are required to protect the national population from the adverse effects of tobacco smoke exposure.

795,G,"Objectives: The objective of this study is to evaluate the uptake of competency-based behaviour change counselling training within a primary healthcare setting. Specific questions concerning provider readiness for training, perceived importance of training in the context of service demands and perceptions of competence after training were addressed. Study design: A process-focused study which adopted a complex systems approach to implementation. Each step was evaluated before the next step was developed. The design was guided by the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, maintenance) framework. Methods: Four specific primary care services were identified and behaviour change counselling training tailored to each service was provided, based on a model of training built around competencies in establishing change-based relationships, assessing and promoting readiness to change, using evidence-based behaviour modification skills when ready and addressing psychosocial determinants of behaviour within scope of practice. Before training, a manager's readiness to facilitate training and identification of peer leaders to support ongoing practice of skills were completed. Results: Two programs negotiated 8 h of formal training, one program received 10 h and one program received 12 h. All programs engaged in peer support activities. Despite willingness to support training, 90% of managers were ambivalent about training activities, relative to one half of healthcare providers (HCPs). Few HCPs and no managers self-identified as ready without ambivalence. Furthermore, HCPs were reluctant to be evaluated by an expert and preferred self-evaluation methods. In contrast, HCPs uniformly endorsed the relevance, value and professional commitment to all component skills of the behaviour change counselling model. At the end of the training, over 75% of staff reported receiving formal training (reach). Almost 80% of staff reported using change-based relationship skills daily, with less frequent use of skills associated with addressing psychosocial issues. The degree of corrective feedback was generally low, however. An index of competency based on formal training, frequent use and receiving corrective feedback indicated that most HCPs did not meet these criteria. Conclusion: Training in behaviour change counselling competencies was successfully implemented in this project. The vast majority of HCPs received training, despite ambivalence. Furthermore, HCPs strongly valued these skills and used them frequently. However, they were reluctant to accept corrective feedback. Future research is needed to evaluate innovative strategies to overcome obstacles to receiving corrective feedback in the use of behaviour change counselling skills. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

796,G,"Objectives: The objective of this study is to increase understanding of knowledge, attitudes, and preventative practices regarding ischemic heart disease (IHD) in sub-Saharan Africa in order to develop patient-centered interventions to improve care and outcomes. Study design: This is a prospective observational study. Methods: Adult patients presenting with chest pain or shortness of breath to an emergency department in northern Tanzania were enrolled. A questionnaire was adapted from existing knowledge attitude and practice surveys regarding cardiovascular disease and the WHO STEPS instrument. Individual five-year risk of cardiovascular event was determined by validated models based on age, sex, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, diabetes, and smoking status. An IHD knowledge score was calculated by giving one point for each correct response to the knowledge-related items, with a maximum score of 10. Associations between IHD knowledge and patient characteristics were assessed by Welch's t-test. Results: A total of 349 patients were enrolled, with median interquartile range (IQR) age 60 (45, 72) years. Of participants, 259 (74.2%) had hypertension, and 228 (65.3%) had greater than 10% five-year risk of cardiovascular event. The mean (SD) knowledge score was 4.8 (3.3). The majority of respondents (224, 64.2%) recognized obesity as a risk factor for heart attack, while a minority (34, 9.7%) knew that a daily aspirin could reduce the risk of cardiovascular event. Greater IHD knowledge was associated with younger age (P = 0.045) and higher levels of education (P < 0.001) but not higher risk of cardiovascular disease (P = 0.123). Most respondents expressed a willingness to diet to improve their health (322, 92.3%) and a preference for treatment from a physician rather than a traditional healer for a heart attack (321, 92.0%). A minority of patients reported exercising regularly (88, 25.2%) or seeing a doctor routinely for checkups (100, 28.7%). Conclusions: High-risk emergency department patients in northern Tanzania have moderate knowledge regarding IHD but do not consistently engage in healthy preventive practices. Patient-centered interventions are needed to improve IHD knowledge and practices in high-risk populations. (C) 2019 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

797,G,"Objective: Smokers who access free National Health Service (NHS) Stop Smoking Services (SSS) in the UK are four times more likely to stop smoking, yet uptake of the services has been in decline in recent years. Evidence was collated to explore the beliefs of smokers, ex-smokers and Stop Smoking Advisors (SSAs) about SSS and the barriers and facilitators to access. Study design: Mixed-methods design including i) a search of the literature; ii) a cross-sectional online questionnaire completed by 38 smokers and ex-smokers; and iii) semi-structured interviews with 5 SSAs. Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Prospero and the NIHR Portfolio were searched in October 2017 to identify relevant studies. Smokers and ex-smokers were recruited to the online questionnaire via Public Health websites and social media in Warwickshire. SSAs identified via Public Health Warwickshire were invited to take part in an interview conducted over the telephone. Findings were collated and analysed using the COM-B ('Capability', 'Opportunity', 'Motivation' and 'Behaviour') model framework. Results: A range of practical and psychological or belief-based barriers and facilitators to accessing SSS were identified within all the components of the COM-B model, aside from physical capability, for example; 'Psychological capability', such as lack of understanding about what the service offers; 'Reflective motivation', such as lack of confidence in service efficacy; and 'Social opportunity', such as recommendations from healthcare professionals to attend. Suggestions and consideration on how future tobacco control intervention and public health messages can address these components are reported. Conclusions: Public health interventions and campaigns may benefit from focussing on addressing the well-known perceived barriers and facilitators smokers experience, in particular focussing on the components of the COM-B that have been identified as being important to increase the uptake of SSS.

798,G,"Objectives: Previous research has documented the adverse association between hurricanes and HIV health outcomes; however, no research has been conducted to examine whether there is spatial overlap between hurricane events and the epidemiology of HIV in the United States. The objectives of this study were to assess the geographic distributions of and spatial autocorrelation between HIV prevalence and the occurrences of hurricanes in the US. Study design: This was a cross-sectional study. Methods: Data on HIV prevalence rates were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and data on US hurricane events were obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ArcGIS, version 10.6, was used for mapping HIV prevalence rates and occurrences of hurricane events, and GeoDa, version 1.12, was used to conduct all univariate and bivariate spatial autocorrelation analyses. Results: HIV and hurricanes primarily affected states located in the south and along the Gulf Coast. Major hurricanes were reported among these regions also. States recording 20 or more hurricanes between 1851 and 2017 had an average HIV prevalence rate of 453.2 cases per 100,000 in 2016. States recording five or more major hurricanes between 1851 and 2017 had an average HIV prevalence rate of 421.8 cases per 100,000 in 2016. Regarding univariate spatial autocorrelation, HIV prevalence was clustered (Moran's I: 0.1913; pseudo P-value: 0.003). Hurricane events were also clustered (Moran's I: 0.2826; pseudo P-value: 0.004), as were major hurricanes (Moran's I: 0.1982; pseudo P-value: 0.009). There was statistically significant bivariate spatial autocorrelation between neither HIV and hurricanes nor HIV and major hurricanes. Conclusion: The epidemiology of HIV prevalence and hurricane events has overlapping geographic patterns. This may have implications for hurricane readiness and recovery planning with respect to people living with HIV. (C) 2019 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

799,G,"Objectives: Conflict-driven displacement is an indisputable social determinant of health. Yet, data on changes in health along the migration trajectories of refugees are scarce. This study aims to assess the longitudinal changes in somatic and mental health and use of medication among Syrian refugees relocating from a conflict-near transit setting in the Middle East to a resettlement setting in Europe. Further, we examine different health status trajectories and factors that predict health in the early postmigration period. Study design: This is a prospective cohort study. Methods: Survey data were collected during 2017-2018 among adult Syrian refugees in Lebanon selected for quota resettlement and at follow-up approximately one year after resettlement in Norway. Our primary outcomes were non-communicable disease (NCD), chronic impairment, chronic pain, anxiety/depression, post-traumatic stress symptoms, and daily use of drugs. We estimated longitudinal changes in prevalence proportions using generalized estimating equations and evaluated effect modification of health outcomes. Results: Altogether, 353 Syrians participated. NCDs declined (12%-9%), while the prevalence of chronic impairment, chronic pain, and use of drugs remained nearly unchanged (29%-28%, 30%-28%, and 20%-18%) between baseline and follow-up. Conversely, mental health outcomes improved (anxiety/depression 33%-11%, post-traumatic stress disorder 5%-2%). Effect modifiers for improvement over time included younger age, short length of stay, and non-legal status in the transit country before resettlement in Europe. Conclusions: We find that mental health outcomes improve from a conflict-near transit setting in Lebanon to an early resettlement setting in Norway, while somatic health outcomes remain stable. Temporal changes in health among moving populations warrant attention, and long-term changes need further scrutiny. (c) 2020 The Author(s).

800,G,"Objectives: This study aims to evaluate the impact of psychological and sociodemographic variables on perceived personal and comparative susceptibility to diseases caused by a novel, unknown virus. Study design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: A total of 438 adults (200 male and 238 female) were interviewed in the waiting rooms of three primary care medicine outpatient clinics. The participants completed three validated question-naires: the Italian Adjustment of Risk Perception of Infectious Diseases questionnaire, the General Self-Efficacy (GSE) scale, and the Italian Version of Personality Inventory (ITAPI). Results: Only 5% of the respondents believed it likely that they would contract a disease caused by a novel virus in the following months, even though 5.9% considered this probability higher than that of other people of the same age and gender. Gender (P<.04), age (P=.002), and marital status (P=.002) significantly affected the perceived risk of getting a disease caused by a novel virus. Self-efficacy (P<.001), imagination (P<.001), and empathy (P <.001) were significant predictors of perceived personal susceptibility. Self-efficacy (P=.04) and imagination (P=.04) were predictive of perceived comparative susceptibility. Conclusions: Adequate psycho-educational interventions are necessary to empower the population in adopting the necessary prevention and containment measures aimed at limiting the spread of novel diseases such as COVID-19 and avoiding disastrous consequences both at the health and economic level.

801,G,"Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic poses an unprecedented threat to the health and economic prosperity of the world's population. Yet, because not all regions are affected equally, this research aims to understand whether the relative growth rate of the initial outbreak in early 2020 varied significantly between the US states and counties. Study design: Based on publicly available case data from across the USA, the initial outbreak is statistically modeled as an exponential curve. Methods: Regional differences are visually compared using geo maps and spaghetti lines. In addition, they are statistically analyzed as an unconditional model (one-way random effects analysis of variance estimated with HLM 7.03); the bias between state- and county-level models is evidenced with distribution tests and BlandeAltman plots (using SPSS 26). Results: At the state level, the outbreak rate follows a normal distribution with an average relative growth rate of 0.197 (doubling time 3.518 days). But there is a low degree of reliability between state-wide and county-specific data reported (Intraclass correlation coefficient ICC = 0.169, P < 0.001), with a bias of 0.070 (standard deviation 0.062) as shown with a BlandeAltman plot. Hence, there is a significant variation in the outbreak between the US states and counties. Conclusions: The results emphasize the need for policy makers to look at the pandemic from the smallest population subdivision possible, so that countermeasures can be implemented, and critical resources provided effectively. Further research is needed to understand the reasons for these regional differences. (c) 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
802,G,"Objectives: World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for health programmes and healthcare delivery are the foundation of its technical leadership in public health and essential to decision-making globally. A key function of guideline development is to identify areas in which further evidence is needed because filling these gaps will lead to future improvements in population health. The objective of this study was to examine the knowledge gaps and research questions for addressing those gaps generated through the WHO guideline development process, with the goal of informing future strategies for improving and strengthening the guideline development process. Study design: We did a systematic, retrospective analysis of research questions identified in the published guidelines. Methods: We analyzed guidelines published between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2018, by the Communicable Diseases Cluster in five disease areas: tuberculosis (TB), HIV, malaria, TB-HIV, and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). Research questions were extracted independently by two researchers. We analyzed the distribution of research questions by disease and by topic category and did a qualitative assessment of optimum practice for research question generation during the guideline development process. Results: A total of 48 guidelines were included: 26 on HIV, 1 on malaria, 11 on TB, 5 on TB/HIV, and 5 on NTDs. Overall, 36 (75%) guidelines encompassed a total of 360 explicit research questions; the remainder did not contain specific research questions. The number of research questions that focused on TB was 49, TB/HIV was 38, HIV was 250, and NTDs was 23. The number of research questions that focused on diagnosis was 43 (11.9%) of 360, prevention was 62 (17.2%), treatment was 103 (28.6%), good practice was 12 (3.3%), service delivery was 86 (23.8%), and other areas was 54 (15%). Research questions were often not formulated in a specific or actionable way and were hard to identify in the guideline. Examples of good practice identified by the review team involved the generation of specific and narrowly defined research questions, with accompanying recommendations for appropriate study design. Conclusions: The WHO must strengthen its approach to identifying and presenting research questions during the guideline development process. Ensuring access to research questions is a key next step in adding value to the guideline development process. (c) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Royal Society for Public Health."
803,G,"Objectives: To investigate factors associated with adherence to self-isolation and lockdown measures due to COVID-19 in the UK. Study design: Online cross-sectional survey. Methods: Data were collected between 6th and 7th May 2020. A total of 2240 participants living in the UK aged 18 years or older were recruited from YouGov's online research panel. Results: A total of 217 people (9.7%) reported that they or someone in their household had symptoms of COVID-19 (cough or high temperature/fever) in the last 7 days. Of these people, 75.1% had left the home in the last 24 h (defined as non-adherent). Men were more likely to be non-adherent, as were people who were less worried about COVID-19, and who perceived a smaller risk of catching COVID-19. Adherence was associated with having received help from someone outside your household. Results should be taken with caution as there was no evidence for associations when controlling for multiple analyses. Of people reporting no symptoms in the household, 24.5% had gone out shopping for nonessentials in the last week (defined as non-adherent). Factors associated with non-adherence and with a higher total number of outings in the last week included decreased perceived effectiveness of government `lockdown' measures, decreased perceived severity of COVID-19 and decreased estimates of how many other people were following lockdown rules. Having received help was associated with better adherence. Conclusions: Adherence to self-isolation is poor. As we move into a new phase of contact tracing and self-isolation, it is essential that adherence is improved. Communications should aim to increase knowledge about actions to take when symptomatic or if you have been in contact with a possible COVID-19 case. They should also emphasise the risk of catching and spreading COVID-19 when out and about and the effectiveness of preventative measures. Using volunteer networks effectively to support people in isolation may promote adherence. (c) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Royal Society for Public Health."
804,G,"Objectives: Data relating to the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the Middle East remains sparse. This study examines the public's perceptions of the pandemic, assesses the extent to which participants have adhered to a range of recommended health-protective behaviours to prevent infection and evaluates whether anxiety about COVID-19 or perceptions related to the pandemic are associated with greater adherence to these behaviours. Study design: A cross-sectional, survey-based design was used. Data were collected using an electronic survey distributed to students, staff and faculty at universities in the three major cities of the United Arab Emirates, Abu Dhabi, Al Ain and Dubai, between the 23rd and 31st of April 2020. A total of 634 participants were included in the analysis. Methods: Participants reported whether they had adhered to health-protective behaviours such as spatial distancing, increased hygiene and disinfection and diminished time spent outside their homes. They also reported the perceived efficacy of a range of behaviours aimed at reducing risk for contracting COVID-19. Data relating to perception of risk, negative consequences of contracting the disease, perceived longevity of the illness and perceptions of the accuracy of the information read about COVID-19 were collected. Anxiety related to COVID-19 was also assessed, as well as a range of demographic variables. Binary logistic regressions were used to examine whether the demographic variables, perceived efficacy ratings and the perception variables were associated with overall adherence. Results: A total of 44.8% of the sample reported adherence to all the examined behaviours. Participants who were employed, those with some or completed postsecondary education and those with a chronic illness diagnosis were more likely to adhere to the precautionary behaviours. The perception of personal risk of infection (odds ratio [OR]: 0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71-0.98), perception of substantial life consequences of becoming infected (OR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.75-0.10) and the perception that the public health information was clear (OR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.57-0.83) were all positively related with behavioural adherence. The health-protective behaviours were all perceived as being highly efficacious in combating infection, and these efficacy ratings were also positively associated with greater behavioural adherence (OR: 0.41-0.77). Having read the official government public health information was related to greater behavioural adherence (OR: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.23-0.61). Conclusions: Dissemination of reliable public health information during a public health crisis is essential. This study's results highlight the importance of providing the public with information that is clear and consistent and, moreover, emphasises the efficacy of the recommended behaviours as this is likely to improve adherence. When individuals perceive themselves to be at personal risk and are aware of the severity of the consequences posed by the illness, they are more likely to adopt caution. However, in this sample, the trustworthiness of the information portrayed in the media and the perceived duration of the pandemic - whether this would resolve soon or persist well into the future - did not impact adherence.

805,G,"Objectives:: Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are effective in curbing the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. All US states have adopted NPI policies, but the compliance to these measures and influence of sociopolitical factors on NPI adherence is unknown. NPI adherence may be approximated by personal mobility in a population that is tracked by anonymous mobile phone data. Study design: This is a cross-sectional study of state-level mobility changes across the US. Methods: State-level mobility was based on anonymous mobile phone data from multiple participating carriers collected by the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (http://www.healthdata.org). Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to examine the strength and direction of the relationship between political affiliations and mobility restriction across states. Multivariable linear regression analyses were used to assess other factors that may impact personal travel. Results: All states experienced a decline in personal mobility but had varying nadirs ranging from a 34% to a 69% reduction in mobility, which was not temporally related to the timing of state-level NPI measures. There was a statistically significant linear and negative correlation (r = -0.79) between the proportion of Republicans/leaning Republicans and NPI adherence across US states. The negative association between Republicans and NPI adherence was significant even when adjusting for urbanization, proportion of essential workers, population, Gini index, and poverty rates. Conclusions: Political orientation affects risk perception, which may contribute to the unwillingness of some individuals to perceive the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic as a risk and to comply with NPIs. Our results highlight the importance of sociopolitical factors in disease control and emphasize the importance of bipartisan efforts in fighting the pandemic. These results may have implications for the development, dissemination, and communication of public health policies. (c) 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

806,G,"Objectives: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, along with implementation of lockdown and strict public movement restrictions, in Greece has affected hospital visits and admissions. We aimed to investigate trends of cardiac disease admissions during the outbreak of the pandemic and possible associations with the applied restrictive measures. Study design: This is a retrospective observational study. Methods: Data for 4970 patients admitted via the cardiology emergency department (ED) across 3 large-volume urban hospitals in Athens and 2 regional/rural hospitals from February 3, 2020, up to April 12 were recorded. Data from the equivalent (for the COVID-19 outbreak) time period of 2019 and from the postlockdown time period were also collected. Results: A falling trend of cardiology ED visits and hospital admissions was observed starting from the week when the restrictive measures due to COVID-19 were implemented. Compared with the pre -COVID-19 outbreak time period, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) [145 (29/week) vs. 60 (12/week), -59%, P < 0.001], ST elevation myocardial infarction [46 (9.2/week) vs. 21 (4.2/week), -54%, P = 0.002], and non-ST elevation ACS [99 cases ( 19.8/week) vs. 39 (7.8/week), -60% P < 0.001] were reduced at the COVID-19 outbreak time period. Reductions were also noted for heart failure worsening and arrhythmias. The ED visits in the postlockdown period were significantly higher than in the COVID-19 outbreak time period (1511 vs 660; P < 0.05). Conclusion: Our data show significant drops in cardiology visits and admissions during the COVID-19 outbreak time period. Whether this results from restrictive measures or depicts a true reduction of cardiac disease cases warrants further investigation. (c) 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health.

807,G,"Objectives: The aim of the study was to assess the impact of social distancing interventions in Greece and to examine what would have happened if those interventions had not been implemented. Study design: A dynamic, discrete time, stochastic individual-based model was developed to simulate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission. Methods: The model was fitted to the observed trends in COVID-19 deaths and intensive care unit (ICU) bed use in Greece. Results: If Greece had not implemented social distancing interventions, the healthcare system would have been overwhelmed between March 30 and April 4. The combined social distancing interventions and increase in ICU beds averted 4360 (95% credible interval: 3050, 5700) deaths and prevented the healthcare system from becoming overwhelmed.

808,G,"Objectives: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the most devastating pandemic to affect humanity in a century. In this article, we assessed tests as a policy instrument and policy enactment to contain COVID-19 and potentially reduce mortalities. Study design: A model was devised to estimate the factors that influenced the death rate across 121 nations and by income group. Results: Nations with a higher proportion of people aged 65+ years had a higher fatality rate (P = 0.00014). Delaying policy enactment led to a higher case fatality rate (P = 0.0013). A 10% delay time to act resulted in a 3.7% higher case fatality rate. This study found that delaying policies for international travel restrictions, public information campaigns, and testing policies increased the fatality rate. Tests also impacted the case fatality rate, and nations with 10% more cumulative tests per million people showed a 2.8% lower mortality rate. Citizens of nations who can access more destinations without the need to have a prior visa have a significant higher mortality rate than those who need a visa to travel abroad (P = 0.0040). Conclusion: Tests, as a surrogate of policy action and earlier policy enactment, matter for saving lives from pandemics as such policies reduce the transmission rate of the pandemic.

809,G,"Objectives: The Global Matrix of report card grades on physical activity serves as a public health awareness tool by summarising the status of child and youth physical activity prevalence and action. The objectives were to: (1) provide a detailed examination of the evidence informing the `School' and 'Community and Environment' indicators across all participating European Global Matrix 3.0 countries; (2) explore the comparability of the grades for these two indicators across Europe; (3) detail any limitations or issues with the methods used to assign grades; and (4) provide suggestions on how future grading of the indicators could be improved. Study design: A comparative review of published methods on the grading of Global Matrix 3.0 indicators across European countries. Methods: Key documents relating to the European countries involved in the 2018 Global Matrix 3.0 were collated and a template used to extract data for both the `School' and `Community and Environment' indicators. Results: Seventeen of the 20 European Report Card countries (85%) had a grade for schools, and 15 countries (75%) had a grade for community and environment. All countries considered between one and five factors when assigning the grade for these indicators. There were wide disparities in the number and sources of evidence used to assign the grades for both indicators, limiting the comparability of the evidence between different countries. Conclusion: To enable comparability, the authors recommend moving towards an agreed standardised set of metrics for grading each indicator. Furthermore, it would be useful to develop and share common tools, methods and instruments to collect data in a uniform way across countries, where possible. Such action will ultimately make the Global Matrix a more robust and useful tool for the future. (c) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Royal Society for Public Health."

Comparisons of the physical quantities are shown in figures to depict the effects of angular velocity, nonhomogeneity parameter, and magnetic field."
818,H,"We consider the structure of the flow monoid for some classes of regular semigroups (which are special case of flows on categories) and for Cauchy categories. In detail, we characterize flows for Rees matrix semigroups, rectangular bands, and full transformation semigroups and also describe the Cauchy categories for some classes of regular semigroups such as completely simple semigroups, Brandt semigroups, and rectangular bands. In fact, we obtain a general structure for the flow monoids on Cauchy categories."
819,H,"Collatz Conjecture (3x+1 problem) states any natural number x will return to 1 after 3?x+1 computation (when x is odd) and x/2 computation (when x is even). In this paper, we propose a new approach for possibly proving Collatz Conjecture (CC). We propose Reduced Collatz Conjecture (RCC)any natural number x will return to an integer that is less than x. We prove that RCC is equivalent to CC. For proving RCC, we propose exploring laws of Reduced Collatz Dynamics (RCD), i.e., from a starting integer to the first integer less than the starting integer. RCC can also be stated as follows: RCD of any natural number exists. We prove that RCD is the components of original Collatz dynamics (from a starting integer to 1); i.e., RCD is more primitive and presents better properties. We prove that RCD presents unified structure in terms of (3?x+1)/2 and x/2, because 3?x+1 is always followed by x/2. The number of forthcoming (3?x+1)/2 computations can be determined directly by inputting x. We propose an induction method for proving RCC. We also discover that some starting integers present RCD with short lengths no more than 7. Hence, partial natural numbers are proved to guarantee RCC in this paper, e.g., 0 module 2; 1 module 4; 3 module 16; 11 or 23 module 32; 7, 15, or 59 module 128. The future work for proving CC can follow this direction, to prove that RCD of left portion of natural numbers exists."
820,H,"In this paper, we introduce the concept of multivalued contraction mappings in partially ordered bipolar metric spaces and establish the existence of unique coupled fixed point results for multivalued contractive mapping by using mixed monotone property in partially ordered bipolar metric spaces.

822,H,"Let P-n be the configuration space of equilateral spatial n-gons. For theta is an element of(0,pi) and k is an element of{0,1,...,n}, let P-n(k) (theta) be the subspace of P-n consisting of elements whose first k bond angles are theta. Recently, the topological type of P-n(k) (theta) was determined for small n, special theta, and k=n or n - 2. In this paper, we determine the topological type of P-n(n-3) (theta) for general n and theta."
823,H,"A definition of the two-dimensional quaternion linear canonical transform (QLCT) is proposed. The transform is constructed by substituting the Fourier transform kernel with the quaternion Fourier transform (QFT) kernel in the definition of the classical linear canonical transform (LCT). Several useful properties of the QLCT are obtained from the properties of the QLCT kernel. Based on the convolutions and correlations of the LCT and QFT, convolution and correlation theorems associated with the QLCT are studied. An uncertainty principle for the QLCT is established. It is shown that the localization of a quaternion-valued function and the localization of the QLCT are inversely proportional and that only modulated and shifted two-dimensional Gaussian functions minimize the uncertainty."

827,H,"The Ahlfors map is a conformal mapping function that maps a multiply connected region onto a unit disk. It can be written in terms of the Szego kernel and the Garabedian kernel. In general, a zero of the Ahlfors map can be freely prescribed in a multiply connected region. The remaining zeros are the zeros of the Szego kernel. For an annulus region, it is known that the second zero of the Ahlfors map can be computed analytically based on the series representation of the Szego kernel. This paper presents another analytical method for finding the second zero of the Ahlfors map for an annulus region without using the series approach but using a boundary integral equation and knowledge of intersection points."
828,H,"This paper proposes a generalized modified iterative scheme where the composed self-mapping driving can have distinct stepdependent composition order in both the auxiliary iterative equation and the main one integrated in Ishikawa's scheme. The selfmapping which drives the iterative scheme is a perturbed 2-cyclic one on the union of two sequences of nonempty closed subsets {....}8.. = 0 and {....}8.. = 0 of a uniformly convex Banach space. As a consequence of the perturbation, such a driving self-mapping can lose its cyclic contractive nature along the transients of the iterative process. These sequences can be, in general, distinct of the initial subsets due to either computational or unmodeled perturbations associated with the self-mapping calculations through the iterative process. It is assumed that the set-theoretic limits below of the sequences of sets {....}8.. = 0 and {....}8.. = 0 exist. The existence of fixed best proximity points in the set-theoretic limits of the sequences to which the iterated sequences converge is investigated in the case that the cyclic disposal exists under the asymptotic removal of the perturbations or under its convergence of the driving self-mapping to a limit contractive cyclic structure."
829,H,"In this paper, we give the direct method to find of the core inverse and its generalizations that is based on their determinantal representations. New determinantal representations of the right and left core inverses, the right and left core-EP inverses, and the DMP, MPD, and CMP inverses are derived by using determinantal representations of the Moore-Penrose and Drazin inverses previously obtained by the author. Since the Bott-Duffin inverse has close relation with the core inverse, we give its determinantal representation and its application in finding solutions of the constrained linear equations that is an analog of Cramer's rule. A numerical example to illustrate the main result is given."
830,H,The aim of this article is to introduce a new definition for the Fourier transform. This new definition will be considered as one of the generalizations of the usual (classical) Fourier transform. We employ the new Katugampola derivative to obtain some properties of the Katugampola Fourier transform and find the relation between the Katugampola Fourier transform and the usual Fourier transform. The inversion formula and the convolution theorem for the Katugampola Fourier transform are considered.

A connected detour set of G is defined as a subset S subset of V such that the induced subgraph G[S] is connected and every vertex of G lies on a u - v detour for some u, v epsilon S. The connected detour number cdn(G) of a graph G is the minimum order of the connected detour sets of G. In this paper, we determined cdn(G) for three special classes of graphs G, namely, unicyclic graphs, bicyclic graphs, and cog-graphs for C-p, K-p,K- and K-m,K-n."

The fractional derivative is regarded in Caputo sense. Numerical evaluations are included to demonstrate the validity and applicability of this technique."
833,H,"A mathematical heuristic model was proposed to analyze the flow of information in administrative workflows. The model starts from a conceptual analysis from the perspective of probabilistic systems, information theory, and information entropy. The main parameters of the analysis are to identify theoretically a workflow as a hybrid dynamic system where the probabilistic distribution of the information, the time of information processing, and the precision with which the workflow is executed are caused by the cognitive performance of agents within a complex adaptive system. The model of analysis provides support for the search for empirical evidence in workflow investigations, highlighting the presence or absence of agent ad hoc methods and their influence on firm's productivity."
834,H,"In a Hilbert space, concepts of attractive point and acute point are studied by many researchers. Moreover, these concepts extended to Banach space. In this paper, we introduce a new class of mappings on Banach space corresponding to the class of all widely more generalized hybrid mappings on Hilbert space. Moreover, we introduce some extensions of acute point and prove some acute point theorems."
835,H,"The orbits of a real form G of a complex semisimple Lie group GC and those of the complexification KC of its maximal compact subgroup K acting on Z=GC/Q, a homogeneous, algebraic, GC-manifold, are finite. Consequently, there is an open G-orbit. Lower-dimensional orbits are on the boundary of the open orbit with the lowest dimensional one being closed. Induced action on the parameter space of certain compact geometric objects (cycles) related to the manifold in question has been characterized using duality relations between G- and KC-orbits in the case of an open G-orbit and more recently lower-dimensional G-orbits. We show that the parameter space associated with the unique closed G-orbit in Z agrees with that of the other orbits characterized as a certain explicitly defined universal domain."
836,H,"This paper deals with the existence of mild solutions for the following Cauchy problem: d(alpha)x(t)/dt(alpha). Ax(t) + f(t, x(t)), x(0) = x(0) + g(x), t subset of [0, t], where d(alpha)(.)/dt(alpha) is the so-called conformable fractional derivative. The linear part A is the infinitesimal generator of a uniformly continuous semigroup (T(t))(t >= 0) on a Banach space X, f and g are given functions. The main result is proved by using the Darbo-Sadovskii fixed point theorem without assuming the compactness of the family (T(t))(t>0) and the Lipshitz condition on the nonlocal part g."

Some known special cases have also been mentioned in the concluding section."
839,H,"We study the interaction between coefficient and solution conditions for complex linear differential equations in the unit disk within the context of normal families and corresponding families of differential equations. In addition, we consider this interaction within the context of normal functions in terms of Noshiro. Consideration of families of differential equations introduces a new perspective for studying normality. Consequently, sharper results are found than in previous studies involving normal functions within the context of one differential equation."
840,H,"Functions of bounded variations form important transition between absolute continuous and singular functions. With Bainov's introduction of impulsive differential equations having solutions of bounded variation, this class of functions had eventually entered into the theory of differential equations. However, the determination of existence of solutions is still problematic because the solutions of differential equations is usually at least absolute continuous which is disrupted by the solutions of bounded variations. As it is known, if f:[a,b lambda]-> Rn is of bounded variation then f is the sum of an absolute continuous function fa and a singular function fs where the total variation of fs generates a singular measure tau and fs is absolute continuous with respect to tau. In this paper we prove that a function of bounded variation f has two representations: one is f which was described with an absolute continuous part with respect to the Lebesgue measure lambda, while in the other an integral with respect to tau forms the absolute continuous part and t(tau) defines the singular measure. Both representations are obtained as parameter transformation images of an absolute continuous function on total variation domain [a,b nu]."
841,H,"In this paper, we present an uncoupled leap-frog finite difference method for the system of equations arising from sweat transport through porous textile media. Based on physical mechanisms, the sweat transport can be viewed as the multicomponent flow that coupled the heat and moisture transfer, such that the system is nonlinear and strongly coupled. The leap-frog method is proposed to solve this system, with the second order accuracy in both spatial and temporal directions. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the system with optimal error estimates in the discrete L2 norm. Numerical simulations are presented and analyzed, respectively."
842,H,"We herein present the detailed results for the existence and uniqueness of mild solution for multifractional order impulsive integrodifferential control equations with a nonlocal condition involving several types of semigroups of bounded linear operators, which were established on probability density functions related with the fractional differential equation.

844,H,"In this paper, we introduce an iterative method for approximating a common solution of monotone inclusion problem and fixed point of Bregman nonspreading mappings in a reflexive Banach space. Using the Bregman distance function, we study the composition of the resolvent of a maximal monotone operator and the antiresolvent of a Bregman inverse strongly monotone operator and introduce a Halpern-type iteration for approximating a common zero of a maximal monotone operator and a Bregman inverse strongly monotone operator which is also a fixed point of a Bregman nonspreading mapping. We further state and prove a strong convergence result using the iterative algorithm introduced. This result extends many works on finding a common solution of the monotone inclusion problem and fixed-point problem for nonlinear mappings in a real Hilbert space to a reflexive Banach space."
845,H,"The main purpose of this paper is to study mixed equilibrium problems in Hadamard spaces. First, we establish the existence of solution of the mixed equilibrium problem and the unique existence of the resolvent operator for the problem. We then prove a strong convergence of the resolvent and a Delta-convergence of the proximal point algorithm to a solution of the mixed equilibrium problem under some suitable conditions. Furthermore, we study the asymptotic behavior of the sequence generated by a Halpern-type PPA. Finally, we give a numerical example in a nonlinear space setting to illustrate the applicability of our results. Our results extend and unify some related results in the literature."

848,H,"In this article, we study the approximate fixed point sequence of an evolution family. A family E=Ux,y;x >= y >= 0 of a bounded nonlinear operator acting on a metric space M,d is said to be an evolution family if Ux,x=I and Ux,yUy,z=Ux,z for all x >= y >= z >= 0. We prove that the common approximate fixed point sequence is equal to the intersection of the approximate fixed point sequence of two operators from the family. Furthermore, we apply the Ishikawa iteration process to construct an approximate fixed point sequence of an evolution family of nonlinear mapping."
849,H,"In this research, we prove strong and weak convergence results for a class of mappings which is much more general than that of Suzuki nonexpansive mappings on Banach space through the Picard-Krasnoselskii hybrid iteration process.

Finally, we establish some properties of nearly soft Menger spaces with respect to hereditary and topological properties and product spaces."
851,H,"A single-machine scheduling problem with deterioration and learning effect is studied in the present paper. The processing time and due date are considered uncertain variables due to lack of historical data. The aim is to minimize the makespan, total completion time, total weight completion time, and maximum lateness under an uncertain environment. To address the problem in an uncertain environment, the expected value model and pessimistic value model are developed. These models can be converted into equivalent models based on the inverse distribution method. It is proved that the corresponding dispatching rules can solve the problem optimally under different objective criteria. Finally, sensitivity analysis is used to illustrate the effectiveness of these rules."
852,H,"The main objective of this paper is to obtain the fractional integral operator inequalities which provide bounds of the sum of these operators at an arbitrary point.

854,I,"We propose a framework for evaluating the quality of solar irradiance probabilistic forecasts. The verification framework is based on visual diagnostic tools and a set of scoring rules mostly originating from the weather forecast verification community. Two types of probabilistic forecasts are used as a basis to illustrate the application of these verification approaches. The first one consists in ensemble forecasts commonly provided by national or international meteorological centres. The second one originates from statistical methods and produces a set of discrete quantile forecasts, the nominal proportions of which span the unit interval. These probabilistic forecasts are evaluated for two selected sites that experience very different climatic conditions. The first site is located in the continental US while the second one is situated on La Reunion Island. Although visual diagnostic tools can help identify deficiencies in generated forecasts, it is recommended that a set of numerical scores be used to assess the quality of probabilistic forecasts. In particular, the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) seems to have all the features needed to evaluate a probabilistic forecasting system and, as such, may become a standard for verifying solar irradiance probabilistic forecasts and by extension probabilistic forecasts of solar power generation."
855,I,"Use of horizontal single-axis trackers in PV power plants is becoming more common, especially with the introduction of bifacial modules. This raises the possibility of combating soiling by adjusting the tracker tilt angle to minimize dust deposition or maximize wind cleaning, at night or when cloudy. In this study we experimentally investigated soiling of coupons tilted about an axis perpendicular to wind, using both an environmental wind tunnel and desert field tests. CFD modeling was also performed to help interpret the experimental results. In the field it was found that maximum deposition (total particles impacting the coupon) occurred when coupons were tilted around 45 degrees toward the wind. However maximum accumulation (particles remaining on the coupon) occurred at 22 degrees tilt away from the wind. The difference was due to a high fraction of particles detaching from coupons when they are tilted toward the wind, which raises flow velocity and shear rate near the surface. The results suggest that to minimize soiling at night, 1-axis PV trackers could be stowed at maximum tilt toward the wind."
856,I,"Solar cooking is one possible solution to reduce the domination of fossil fuel in the domestic sector and to benefit from renewable energy. This study assesses the solar cooking potential in Switzerland. A nodal model, based on energy balance equations of a box-type solar cooker is implemented in Matlab. Model parameters that cannot be determined experimentally or analytically are evaluated through an optimization procedure based on a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The model is able to predict the temperature of the cooking vessel with an average relative error around 5%. Based on its reliability, the model is simulated over a year for different locations in Switzerland in order to determine the solar cooking potential. It is characterized by a metric that represents the number of days in a year the oven could be used to cook potatoes for two persons. It is found that the cooking times of potatoes can be well predicted by an Arrhenius law with an activation energy of 74.14 [kJ/mol]. The potato cooking criterion is based on the Arrhenius equation and determines if the pot simulated temperature profile of a particular day allows to cook potatoes. The North-East of Switzerland is the least favourable area for solar cooking with theoretically around 155 cooking days per year. Around 240 days are estimated to be suitable for cooking in the cantons of Valais and Grisons, which represents a significant potential for solar cooking in Switzerland."
857,I,"The functional layers arrangement in a dye sensitized solar cell electrochromic device (DSSC-EC) on the energy conversion efficiency and on the ability to change the color is studied. The highest power conversion efficiency of ca. 7% and good color change in closed circuit conditions was observed with electrochromic WO3 deposited on the counter-electrode of the DSSC. When WO3 layer was applied over the photoanode, the DSSC-EC displayed less power conversion efficiency - 3.4%, but a more intense color change was observed under illumination and opened external circuit. Response of the photocurrent vs. applied potential, incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency and optical behavior of the DSSC-EC were assessed and discussed considering optical properties of the components of the device and their energy bands alignment. Smart window and self-powered proof-of-concept pixelated device operating on DSSC-EC are presented."
858,I,"Performance tests of concentrating solar collectors are based on energy balance studies which require accurate measurements of fluid mass flow rate, temperature difference over the collector length and the knowledge of the specific heat capacity of the used heat transfer fluid (HTF). Especially at operation temperatures in the range of 200-400 degrees C, the accuracy of HTF manufacturer data regarding the specific heat capacity of used HTFs is insufficient. This shortcoming contributes significantly to the overall measurement uncertainty of thermal collector assessments. In the present paper, the measurement results of a flow through calorimeter measuring the specific heat capacity of SYLTHERM 800 under field conditions at temperatures up to 330 degrees C are presented. The HTF measurement shows good agreement (deviation below 1.2%) with a Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) measurement for temperatures below 270 degrees C. For higher temperatures, the deviation between flow through calorimeter and DSC measurement increases to 3.7% at 330 degrees C. Furthermore, several technical design and measurement improvements over the calorimeter design presented in 2012 are described in detail. A validation measurement using water reveals deviations below 0.1% from the water reference values at ambient temperatures. A stringent uncertainty analysis reveals the largest individual measurement uncertainty. The unexpectedly large uncertainty of the Coriolis mass flow sensors at temperatures above 270 degrees C is distinguished by a large individual uncertainty and the comparison to DSC."
859,I,"Solar energy is one of the most widely used renewable energy sources, with photo-voltaic (PV) solar cells/panels now utilized as an important energy source. The strip interconnection between solar cells (used for collecting current from solar cells) is a key PV module component; as poor interconnection reliability can lead to PV module failure. Multi-Busbar is a new type of interconnection which incorporates several round copper wires to help increase the energy conversion and transmission efficiency of PV modules and also to reduce the material costs. The non-homogeneity of the solder coating on the wires (resulting from manufacturing process faults), is one of the main factors that is responsible for the poor connections between the wire and the silver pads; which adversely impacts on the interconnection strength and long term reliability. This paper concerns an investigation of the effect of solder coating non-homogeneity on the thermo-mechanical response of round wires used for PV module interconnections. The study evaluates the two main parameters of non-homogeneity (out of centre value and direction), and also investigates the effect of geometrical parameters. The Extended Finite Element Method in ABAQUS software was used to determine the micro-crack initiation temperature and location for a given joint design. The results show that the cracking temperature is most affected by the direction of solder coating non-homogeneity and the downward vertical direction of out of centre positioning of copper in the solder coating leads to the most reduction in cracking temperature (up to 21%)."
860,I,"During the life-time of Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants, optical performance of solar mirrors are affected by soiling phenomenon and surface degradations, especially in desert and oceanic environments such as those prevailing in North Africa. This optical loss results from the deposition of dust particles, salts, organic materials or any other contaminants present in the solar field or around the CSP installation sites. This phenomenon depends on the different exposure sites with every location having its own meteorological and geological characteristics. Moroccan CSP sites are planned in many locations with different environmental conditions: arid, semi-arid and Saharan, with or without oceanic influence. These environmental factors can have an aggressive impact on the CSP mirrors. Indeed, large particles will tend to degrade the mirror by scratching or breaking the glass surface, while small particles have more chance to deposit on solar mirrors and thus create a soiling layer. These particles are generated from many sources (sand storm, pollution, vehicular movements, etc.) and are transported through the air. This mode of transport is determined as a function of mineral, size, shape and hardness. In this paper, we present a simple methodology for analyzing the chemical and physical characteristics of the sand particles, characterization techniques, and their appropriate laboratory equipment. All the factors previously mentioned could be critical for the CSP mirrors. That is why analyzing these data may be a key point for the industry to understand the effects of soiling and degradation on the CSP mirrors in order to increase the global economic profitability of their solar plants."
861,I,"The research on halide perovskites is in its peak activity at the moment due to the materials potential application in photovoltaics. It is well known that slow processes, from seconds to minutes, are very significant in perovskite films and devices as compared to conventional photovoltaic materials. The kinetics of photoluminescence (PL) is informative data for studying such processes. In particular, tracing the change in PL intensity under continuous laser excitation provides information on charge carriers recombination and the efficiency of their extraction from the absorber layer. Although widely available, this method was applied mainly for the research on thin films. However, monitoring PL kinetics on complete solar cells as well as on incomplete device stacks at each fabrication and lifespan stage can provide an important information on the device optimization and determination of the layers and interfaces that limit device efficiency and stability. Here, we demonstrate the advantages of the method by tracing the evolution of PL kinetics at seconds-to-minutes timescale upon: (1) varying perovskite composition (MAPbI(3), Cs(0.15)FA(0.85)PbI(2.7)Br(0.3), Cs-0.05(MA(0.15)FA(0.85))(0.95)PbI2.55Br0.45); (2) layer-by-layer stack construction of Cs(0.15)FA(0.85)PbI(2.7)Br(0.3)-based solar cell and (3) the device on-shelf degradation. In this way, information on charge carrier recombination, diffusion and extraction is revealed purely by optical, contactless and non-destructive means."
862,I,"A new class of smart window technologies are gaining interest as they have the functionality to control dynamic solar radiation, shading, ventilation and energy production. They are capable of improving buildings' energy performance by adapting to different climate conditions and bring thermal and visual comfort for occupants. Polymer-dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) is a smart switchable window that changes its optical transmissions from translucent to transparent when an alternating electric current stimulus is introduced. The present paper discusses the results of an indoor investigation for the optical and thermal performance of a PDLC glazing system. The spectral transmittance of the investigated PDLC was evaluated for both the translucent and transparent states using UV-vis-NIR (1050) spectrophotometer. In addition, the thermal investigation was carried out in an indoor condition utilising a test cell equipped with a small scale of PDLC glazing, which was exposed to (1000, 800, 600, 400 W/m(2)) solar radiation for 180 min. The optical evaluation showed that the investigated PDLC glazing offered low transmission for UV (8%) and NIR (44%) in the translucent state, respectively. The result of SHGC was 0.68 and 0.63 for the transparent and translucent states, respectively, which indicates that the investigated sample could be more effective in reducing heat loads in a cold dominated climate. The U-value for the PDLC glazing was 2.79 W/m(2) for the transparent and 2.44 W/m(2) translucent."
863,I,"Modelling the effects of solar irradiation plays an important role in various applications. This paper describes a semi-parametric (combined grey-box and spline-based), data-driven technique that can be used to model systems in which the solar gain depends on the sun position. The solar gain factor is introduced, i.e. the absorbed fraction of measured solar irradiation, and estimated as a continuous non-parametric function of the sun position. The implementation of the spline-based solar gain factor in a grey-box model framework is described. The method is tested in two case studies-in a model of the internal temperature of a dwelling in Aalborg, Denmark, and a model of the return temperature of a solar collector field in Solrod, Denmark. It is shown that the solar gain factor as a function of sun position is able to account for structural variations in solar gain that may occur due to factors such as shading obstacles and window or absorber orientation. In both test cases, the spline-based solar gain function improved the model accuracy significantly, and largely reduced structural errors in prediction residuals. In addition, the shape of the estimated function provided insight into the dynamics of the system and the local solar input characteristics. Accurate representation of such site characteristics was not possible with any data-driven method found in the literature. Besides the grey-box models used in this study, the solar gain factor can be used in a variety of data-driven models, for example in linear regression models."
864,I,"The aim of the present work was to develop a new type of solar thermal collector tree shape in three dimensions. It is a Solar Thermal Tree (STT) whose branches and trunk consist of tubular absorbers glazed or not. The article presents the validation of the concept with a medium-scale prototype. The numerical modeling of the STT is first described, then the comparison of the experimental and numerical results, the evaluation of the performances based on dimensionless equations, and finally the multi-criteria optimization. The model has been used to identify the dimensionless equations (thermal efficiency and pressure drop) from a small number of parameters. These equations can be used to design the STT for different applications. It also enabled to define optimal solutions (Pareto) by considering the two performance functions in a configuration close to that of the prototype. Optimal solutions are compared with the experiment using the prototype, a solution that minimizes the creation of entropy generated by flow and heat transfer, and a solution based on the Hess-Murray law that minimizes flow resistance in laminar or turbulent flow. The optimization criterion based on entropy generation is the most relevant because the entropy generated by the air flow is very low compared to heat transfer. Also, optimization leads to maximizing thermal efficiency. Finally, the design of a 4 m(2) STT that can be used to preheat the building's fresh air (0 degrees C) has been optimized. This new configuration, based on vacuum tubes has a thermal efficiency of 58%."
865,I,"The cloud enhancement (CE) of solar irradiance is a well-known phenomenon, but its effects on PV power plants are not thoroughly understood. Because of scalability, the diameters of PV generators can vary from some meters up to several hundreds of meters. The output power of a PV generator depends mainly on the irradiance to the PV panels. Therefore, if the irradiance is enhanced, the actual output power might exceed the nominal power. We created a method to estimate the average irradiance over typical land areas of PV generators. The average irradiance over the PV generator land area was used to calculate the frequency, duration and average irradiance of the CE events. The analysis was based on actual irradiance measurement data from an array of pyranometers on an area of 1400 m 2 , which corresponds to the land area of 0.1 MW PV generator. We found out that the focus areas of the CE events have diameters of the order of tens of meters. Therefore, up to 0.1 MW power range, the land area of the PV generator does not greatly affect the maximum average irradiances. In this power range, the average irradiance was measured to be up to 1.5 times the clear-sky irradiance. The CE events affecting utility-scale PV generators were estimated to have maximum average irradiances of 1.4 times the clear-sky irradiance, but the number of these CE events is considerably lower."
866,I,"Photovoltaic modules long-term reliability is a key requirement to keep this technology a commercially interesting option for energy production. The investment return on PV generation system depends, among other factors, on the peculiarities of the system on efficiency reduction caused by environmental action. Technical standards suggest laboratory tests for the qualification and a better understanding on module degradation behavior. Nevertheless, some degradation modes can only be observed after years of field operation. This paper presents the main signs of degradation on crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules caused by outdoor exposure after a period of 15 years in an installation in the city of Porto Alegre, the southernmost state capital city in Brazil. The electric analysis demonstrated that the modules kept 90.5% of their initial power, with an average of degradation rate of 0.7% per year. Some techniques helped the evaluation of defects caused by exposure of the arrays for long periods of operation, such as electroluminescence imaging and I-V curve testing. The most frequent defects found were browning (encapsulant darkening) and cell encapsulant delamination, leading to the anti-reflective layer deterioration. The junction box of one of the modules was detached, allowing the entrance of moisture and resulting in the disconnection of some of the module cells. The electroluminescence technique also provided a better understanding on modes of degradation. Despite the observed evidences of degradation along these 15 years, it can be said that the system remains within the expected operation limits."
867,I,"The carbon based perovskite solar cell (C-PSC) has a strong commercial potential due its low manufacturing cost and its improved stability. A C-PSC consists of three mesoporous layers sandwiched between a Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate as bottom electrode and carbon as top electrode. However, the low conductivity of the two electrodes represents a real challenge when scaling from individual cells to modules. Here, 2D direct current simulation is used to investigate the influence of width of the active area on the performance of a single C-PSC. The same method is used to study the effect of the sub-cell's width, the interconnection's width and the contact resistance at the interconnection on the performance of a 10 sub-cells module connected in series. The intrinsic properties of the carbon cell are taken in account using experimental J(SC) and V-OC as an input to the modelling. The carbon conductivity is found to be critical in defining the optimum geometry. For a 10 Omega/sq carbon sheet resistance, the optimum interconnection width is 500 mu m and the sub cell width is 4.9 mm, leading to an optimum fill factor of 64%."
868,I,"Zero or plus energy office buildings must have very high building standards and require highly efficient energy supply systems due to space limitations for renewable installations. Conventional solar cooling systems use photovoltaic electricity or thermal energy to run either a compression-cooling machine or an absorption-cooling machine in order to produce cooling energy during daytime, while they use electricity from the grid for the nightly cooling energy demand. With a hybrid photovoltaic-thermal collector, electricity as well as thermal energy can be produced at the same time. These collectors can produce also cooling energy at nighttime by long-wave radiation exchange with the night sky and convection losses to the ambient air. Such a renewable trigeneration system offers new fields of applications. However, the technical, ecological and economical aspects of such systems are still largely unexplored. In this work, the potential of a PVT system to heat and cool office buildings in three different climate zones is investigated. In the investigated system, PVT collectors act as a heat source and heat sink for a reversible heat pump. Due to the reduced electricity consumption (from the grid) for heat rejection, the overall efficiency and economics improve compared to a conventional solar cooling system using a reversible air-to-water heat pump as heat and cold source. A parametric simulation study was carried out to evaluate the system design with different PVT surface areas and storage tank volumes to optimize the system for three different climate zones and for two different building standards. It is shown such a systems are technically feasible today. With a maximum utilization of PV electricity for heating, ventilation, air conditioning and other electricity demand such as lighting and plug loads, high solar fractions and primary energy savings can be achieved. Annual costs for such a system are comparable to conventional solar thermal and solar electrical cooling systems. Nevertheless, the economic feasibility strongly depends on country specific energy prices and energy policy. However, even in countries without compensation schemes for energy produced by renewables, this system can still be economically viable today. It could be shown, that a specific system dimensioning can be found at each of the investigated locations worldwide for a valuable economic and ecological operation of an office building with PVT technologies in different system designs."

Inter-and intramolecular nitrene insertions have been performed from various abietane diterpenoids, leading to the amination of the C-3, C-6, C-7, C-11 and C-15 positions.

870,J,"We introduce the concept of Convertible and Constrained Nucleic Acids (C2NAs). By means of the synthesis of a stereocontrolled N-propargyl dioxo-1,3,2-oxaza-phosphorinane as an internucleotidic linkage, the torsional angles alpha and beta can adopt either the canonical (g(-), t) set of values able to increase DNA duplex stability or the non-canonical (g(+), t) set that stabilized the hairpin structure when installed within the loop moiety. With an appended propargyl function on the nitrogen atom of the six-membered ring, the copper catalysed Huisgen's cycloaddition (CuAAC click chemistry) allows for the introduction of new functionalities at any location on the nucleic acid chain while maintaining the properties brought by the geometrical constraint and the neutral internucleotidic linkage."
871,J,"The known azastilbene (E)-1,2-di(quinolin-3-yl)ethane (2a) and the novel azoniastilbene derivatives (E)-2-(2-(naphthalen-2-yl)vinyl)quinolizinium (2b) and (E)-3,3 '-(ethane-1,2-diyl)bis(1-methylquinolinin-1-ium) (2c) were synthesized. Their interactions with duplex and quadruplex DNA (G4-DNA) were studied by photometric, fluorimetric, polarimetric and flow-LD analysis, and by thermal DNA denaturation studies, as well as by H-1-NMR spectroscopy. The main goal of this study was a comparison of these conformationally flexible compounds with the known G4-DNA-binding diazoniadibenzo[b,k]chrysenes, that have a comparable pi-system extent, but a rigid structure. We have observed that the aza- and azoniastilbene derivatives 2a-c, i.e. compounds with almost the same spatial dimensions and steric demand, bind to DNA with an affinity and selectivity that depends significantly on the number of positive charges. Whereas the charge neutral derivative 2a binds unspecifically to the DNA backbone of duplex DNA, the ionic compounds 2b and 2c are typical DNA intercalators. Notably, the bis-quinolinium derivative 2c binds to G4-DNA with moderate affinity (K-b = 4.8 x 10(5) M-1) and also stabilizes the G4-DNA towards thermal denaturation (Delta T-m = 11 degrees C at ligand-DNA ratio = 5.0). Strikingly, the corresponding rigid counterpart, 4a,12a-diazonia-8,16-dimethyldibenzo[b,k]chrysene, stabilizes the G4-DNA to an even greater extent under identical conditions (Delta T-m = 27 degrees C). These results indicate that the increased flexibility of a G4-DNA ligand does not necessarily lead to stronger interactions with the G4-DNA as compared with rigid ligands that have essentially the same size and pi system extent."
872,J,"Hydrocarbon stapled (HCS) peptides are a class of cross-linked alpha-helix mimetics. The technology relies on the use of alpha,alpha '-disubstituted alkenyl amino acids, which fully contrain the helical region to typically yield peptides with enhanced structural ordering and biological activity. Recently, monosubstituted alkenyl amino acids were disclosed for peptide stapling; however, the impact that this tether has on HCS peptide structure and activity has not yet been fully explored. By applying this HCS to the disordered peptide eIF4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), we discovered that this type of tethering has a dramatic effect on olefin geometry and activity of the resultant stapled peptides, where the putative trans isomer was found to exhibit enhanced in vitro and cellular inhibitory activity against eIF4E protein-protein interactions. We further demonstrated that the metathesis catalyst used for ring-closing metathesis can influence monosubstituted HCS peptide activity, presumably through alteration of the cis/trans olefin ratio. This study represents one of the first in-depth analyses of olefin isomers of a stapled peptide and highlights an additional feature for medicinal chemistry optimization of this class of peptide-based probes."
873,J,"Catalytic direct amidation reactions have been the focus of considerable recent research effort, due to the widespread use of amide formation processes in pharmaceutical synthesis. However, the vast majority of catalytic amidations are performed in non-polar solvents (aromatic hydrocarbons, ethers) which are typically undesirable from a sustainability perspective, and are often poor at solubilising polar carboxylic acid and amine substrates. As a consequence, most catalytic amidation protocols are unsuccessful when applied to polar and/or functionalised substrates of the kind commonly used in medicinal chemistry. In this paper we report a practical and useful catalytic direct amidation reaction using tert-butyl acetate as the reaction solvent. The use of an ester solvent offers improvements in terms of safety and sustainability, but also leads to an improved reaction scope with regard to polar substrates and less nucleophilic anilines, both of which are important components of amides used in medicinal chemistry. An amidation reaction was scaled up to 100 mmol and proceeded with excellent yield and efficiency, with a measured process mass intensity of 8."

875,J,"4-Methylenechromanes were prepared via a three-step process from 2-borylated alpha-methylstyrenes. This sequence is based on a key glyoxylate-ene reaction catalyzed by scandium(iii) triflate. The resulting gamma-hydroxy boronates, which cyclise to seven-membered homologues of benzoxaborole on silica gel, were cleanly oxidized with sodium perborate, and then cyclised under Mitsunobu conditions. Additionally, several further functional transformations of 4-methylenechromanes or their precursors were carried out to illustrate the synthetic potential of these intermediates."
876,J,"Pyridinearene macrocycles have previously shown unique host-guest properties in their capsular dimers including endo complexation of neutral molecules and exo complexation of anions. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the formation of hydrogen bonded hexamer of tetraisobutyl-octahydroxypyridinearene in all three states of matter - gas phase, solution and solid-state. Cationic tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(ii) template was found to stabilize the hexamer in gas phase, whereas solvent molecules do this in condensed phases. In solution, the capsular hexamer was found to be the thermodynamically favoured self-assembly product and transition from dimer to hexamer occurred in course of time. The crystal structure of hexamer revealed 24 N-HMIDLINE HORIZONTAL ELLIPSISO direct intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the six pyridinearene macrocycles without any bridging solvent molecules. Hydrogen bond patterns correlate well with DFT computed structures. Thus, all structural chemistry methods (IM-MS, DOSY NMR, DFT, X-ray crystallography) support the same structure of the hexameric capsule that has a diameter of ca. 3 nm and volume of 1160 angstrom(3)."
877,J,"Galactofuranoconjugates are rare compounds with interesting biological properties. Their syntheses by traditional approaches are however tedious. Glycosidases are nowadays often used to simplify such syntheses but the use of galactofuranosidase has not been described yet for the synthesis of galactofuranoconjugates. Interestingly CtAraf51, an alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase from Ruminiclostridium thermocellum, is able to use aryl- or alkyl-beta-d-galactofuranosides as the substrate but with very low efficiency. To allow its use as a synthesis tool, we decided to improve the efficiency of this enzyme toward these non-natural substrates. First, we identified three residues that can contribute to unfavorable interactions with the p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactofuranoside. After mutagenesis, two mutants have shown a catalytic efficiency four- and threefold higher than that of the wild type, respectively. These two mutants were then evaluated in the transglycosylation reaction using ethanol as a model acceptor substrate. Under these conditions one mutant was much more efficient: 50% conversion was reached ten times faster than with the WT. Finally both mutants were converted into thioglycoligases: in the thioligation reaction, the reaction was two times faster than with the E173A single mutant, and in the acylation reaction a fourfold increase in the initial velocity was found. The synthetic potential of the resulting mutants to synthesize various O-, S- and acyl galactofuranoconjugates was further evaluated and yields up to 82% were obtained for the synthesis of ethyl- or thiophenyl galactofuranosides and methoxybenzoic galactofuranose."
878,J,"The present study describes the synthesis of the first phenoxycalix[4]pyrrole-epichlorohydrin based polymer. The advantage of the latter resides in its fast-single step synthesis protocol, low cost, water insolubility and its unexpected anion extraction capacity. The study of this polymer by various solid/liquid extractions with halides in aqueous solutions and quantitative ion chromatography analysis showed that unlike other calix[4]pyrrole-based entities, this polymer extracts iodide rather than bromide and fluoride owing to the presence of large extraction pockets. Evidence of an anion exchange process involving preferably chloride and bromide was also highlighted."
879,J,"Proteolysis mediated by ClpXP is a crucial cellular process linked to bacterial pathogenesis. The development of specific inhibitors has largely focused on ClpP. However, this focus was challenged by a recent finding showing that conformational control by ClpX leads to a rejection of ClpP binders. Thus, we here follow up on a hit molecule from a high throughput screen performed against the whole ClpXP complex and demonstrate that stable inhibition with high potency is possible. Further investigations revealed that the small molecule binds to ClpP without affecting its activity. Likewise, the molecule does not inhibit ClpX and retains the overall oligomeric state of ClpXP upon binding. Structure activity relationship studies confirmed structural constraints in all three parts of the molecule suggesting binding into a defined stereospecific pocket. Overall, the inhibition of ClpXP without affecting the individual components represents a novel mechanism with perspectives for further optimization for in situ applications."
880,J,"Free cysteine residues react with QuatCy 1, by simply mixing the protein and dye in aqueous buffer at 37 degrees C. Another dye, MHI-148, can be used for a similar labelling protocol, but QuatCy reacts faster with all proteins studied, except albumin; it emerges here that this is because MHI-148 instantly forms of a non-covalent complex with albumin, but QuatCy does not. Labelling with QuatCy has advantages insofar as it is over five times brighter, and much more photostable, than MHI-148, and combination labelling with this dye pair will allow multiplexing in the near-IR region."

To investigate properties of DSGb5, we have prepared its oligosaccharide moiety by chemically synthesizing Gb5 which was enzymatically sialylated using the mammalian sialyltransferases ST3Gal1 and ST6GalNAc5. Glycan microarray binding studies indicate that Siglec-7 does not recognize DSGb5, and preferentially binds Neu5Ac alpha(2,8)Neu5Ac containing glycans."

This nucleotide analog could enzymatically be incorporated into DNA oligonucleotides by primer extension and reverse transcribed to unmodified DNA. This nucleotide could be used in SELEX for the identification of high binding affinity and nuclease resistant aptamers.
883,J,"Catalytic Z-isomerization of retinoids to their thermodynamically less stable Z-isomer remains a challenge. In this report, we present a photochemical approach for the catalytic Z-isomerization of retinoids using monochromatic wavelength UV irradiation treatment. We have developed a straightforward approach for the synthesis of Z-retinoids in high yield, overcoming common obstacles normally associated with their synthesis. Calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) have allowed us to correlate the experimentally observed Z-isomer distribution of retinoids with the energies of chemically important intermediates, which include ground- and excited-state potential energy surfaces. We also demonstrate the application of the current method by synthesizing gram-scale quantities of 9-cis-retinyl acetate 9Z-a. Operational simplicity and gram-scale ability make this chemistry a very practical solution to the problem of Z-isomer retinoid synthesis."

886,J,"The borylative cyclisation of 1,2-dialkynyl benzenes with BCl3 leads to dibenzopentalenes (via intramolecular SEAr) or benzofulvenes (via chloride addition) depending on substituents, with stabilised vinyl cation intermediates (e.g. with a p-MeO-C6H4-group) favouring the latter. The use of borocations leads to more selective dibenzopentalene formation, while other diyne frameworks undergo intramolecular SEAr selectively even with p-MeO groups."
887,J,Taking inspiration from the assembly of so-called peptoids (N-alkylglycine oligomers) we present a new synthetic methodology whereby N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) based Pd ligands were assembled using a sub-monomer approach and loaded with Pd via solid-phase synthesis. This allowed the rapid generation a library of NHC-palladium catalysts that were readily functionalised to allow bioconjugation. These catalysts were able to rapidly activate a caged fluorophore and 'switch-on' an anticancer prodrug in 3D cell culture.
888,J,We report the synthesis of three new triazole functionalized acyclic CB[n]-type receptors (2-4) by click chemistry. The compounds have good solubility in water (>= 8 mM) and do not undergo strong self-association (K-s <= 903 M-1). We measured the binding constants of 2-4 toward guests 9-24 and compared the results to those obtained for the prototypical acyclic CB[n]-type receptor 1. The X-ray crystal structure of 4 is also described.
889,J,"The transient receptor potential channel subfamily member 5 (TRPC5) is a calcium permeable cation channel widely expressed in the brain. Accumulating evidence indicates that it plays a crucial role in psychiatric disorders including depression and anxiety. Positron emission tomography (PET) combined with a TRPC5 specific radioligand may provide a unique tool to investigate the functions of TRPC5 in animal disease models to guide drug development targeting TRPC5. To develop a TRPC5 PET radiotracer, the potent TRPC5 inhibitor HC608 was chosen for C-11 radiosynthesis through the N-demethyl amide precursor 7 reacting with [C-11]methyl iodide. Under optimized conditions, [C-11]HC608 was achieved with good radiochemical yield (25 +/- 5%), high chemical and radiochemical purity (>99%), and high specific activity (204-377 GBq mu mol(-1), decay corrected to the end of bombardment, EOB). The in vitro autoradiography study revealed that [C-11]HC608 specifically binds to TRPC5. Moreover, initial in vivo evaluation of [C-11]HC608 performed in rodents and the microPET study in the brain of non-human primates further demonstrated that [C-11]HC608 was able to penetrate the blood brain barrier and sufficiently accumulate in the brain. These results suggest that [C-11]HC608 has the potential to be a PET tracer for imaging TRPC5 in vivo."
890,J,"The bifunctional ligand p-SCN-Bn-HOPO, which has four 1,2-hydroxypyridinone groups on a spermine backbone with an isothiocyanate linker, has been shown to be an efficient and stable chelator for Zr(iv) and, more importantly, the radioisotope Zr-89 for use in radiolabeling antibodies for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Previous studies of Zr-89-HOPO-trastuzumab in mice showed low background, good tumor to organ contrast, and very low bone uptake which show p-SCN-Bn-HOPO to be an important next-generation bifunctional chelator for radioimmunoPET imaging with Zr-89. However, the reported synthesis of p-SCN-Bn-HOPO involves nine steps and multiple HPLC purifications with an overall yield of about 1.4%. Herein we report an improved and efficient synthesis of p-SCN-Bn-HOPO in four steps with 14.3% overall yield which will improve its availability for further biological studies and wider application in PET imaging. The new synthetic route also allows variation in linker length and chemistries which may be helpful in modifying in vivo clearance behaviors of future agents."
891,J,"The stereoselective synthesis of chiral macrocycles bearing two aliphatic amide functional groups is reported. After the amidation mediated by TBD, a guanidine derivative, the olefin transposition step is performed with a slight excess of t-BuOK. The products are afforded in moderate to good combined yields (up to 59%) and with an excellent syn diastereoselectivity (dr > 49 : 1). Introducing enantiopure alpha-branched substituents was possible and it resulted in mixtures of diastereomers, which could be tested as phase-transfer catalysts using the formation of a phenylalanine analog as a test reaction (up to 43% ee). A clear matched-mismatched situation was observed in the two diastereomeric series."
892,J,"A straightforward access to tricyclic indoles bearing 3,4-fused seven-membered rings has been established by using 4-aminoindoles as 1,4-bisnucleophiles in three-component reactions. 1H-Azepino[4,3,2-cd]indoles, 4,6-dihydro-1H-azepino[4,3,2-cd]indoles and 1,3,4,6-tetrahydro-5H-azepino[4,3,2-cd]indol-5-ones could thus be synthesized in one pot in moderate to good yields. Beyond opening access to 3,4-fused tricyclic indoles, the use of easily accessible 4-aminoindoles as C,N-1,4-bisnucleophiles also provides a new platform to be used in a diversity-oriented synthesis strategy, fully displaying its benefits of maximizing molecular complexity and reaction diversity."
893,J,"We synthesized self-similar molecules (G3 and G2; based on phenylalkynyl backbones) with symmetrically backfolded shapes inspired by the famous fractal of a Sierpinski triangle. Unlike the more traditional, starburst dendrimers, the centripetal-shaped Sierpinski molecules feature side branches symmetrically bent away from the growth direction of the main branch, thus contrasting the natural-tree shape. Molecule G3 exhibits three distinct levels of the structural hierarchy comprising the primary, secondary and tertiary branches, while the smaller G2 contains only features of the 1(st) and 2(nd) orders. In spite of the much larger conjugated backbone of G3, its solution UV-vis absorption and fluorescence exhibit no red shift relative to G2. In a test of nitrobenzene sensing, a thin film of G3 deposited from THF was more sensitively quenched in fluorescence than the smaller G2."
894,J,"Membranous organelles are major endogenous sources of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. When present at high levels, these species can cause macromolecular damage and disease. To better detect and scavenge free radical forms of the reactive species at their sources, we investigated whether nitrone spin traps could be selectively targeted to intracellular membranes using a bioorthogonal imaging approach. Electron paramagnetic resonance imaging demonstrated that the novel cyclic nitrone 5-dodecylcarbamoyl-5-N-dodecylacetamide-1-pyroline-N-oxide (diC(12)PO) could be used to target the nitrone moiety to liposomes composed of phosphatidyl choline. To test localization with authentic membranes in living cells, fluorophores were introduced via strain-promoted alkyne-nitrone cycloaddition (SPANC). Two fluorophore-conjugated alkynes were investigated: hexynamide-fluoresceine (HYA-FL) and dibenzylcyclooctyne-PEG4-5/6-sulforhodamine B (DBCO-Rhod). Computational and mass spectrometry experiments confirmed the cycloadduct formation of DBCO-Rhod (but not HYA-FL) with diC(12)PO in cell-free solution. Confocal microscopy of bovine aortic endothelial cells treated sequentially with diC(12)PO and DBCO-Rhod demonstrated clear localization of fluorescence with intracellular membranes. These results indicate that targeting of nitrone spin traps to cellular membranes is feasible, and that a bioorthogonal approach can aid the interrogation of their intracellular compartmentalization properties."
895,J,"Enzyme transition-state mimics can act as powerful inhibitors and allow structural studies that report on the conformation of the transition-state. Here, mannoimidazole, a mimic of the transition state of mannosidase catalyzed hydrolysis of mannosides, is shown to bind in a B-2,B-5 conformation on the Clostridium perfringens GH125 alpha-1,6-mannosidase, providing additional evidence of a S-O(2)-B-2,B-5-S-1(5) conformational itinerary for enzymes of this family."
896,J,"Conjugation of therapeutics to human serum albumin (HSA) using bromomaleimides represents a promising platform for half-life extension.

This improved reagent design is applied to the construction of an HSA-paclitaxel conjugate, preventing drug loss during maleimide hydrolysis."
897,D,"The fifth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and several studies suggest that climate change is expected to increase food insecurity and poverty in many parts of the world. In this paper, we adopt a microeconometric approach to empirically estimate the impact of climate change-induced hikes in cereal prices on household welfare in Swaziland (also Kingdom of Eswatini). We do so first by econometrically estimating expenditure and price elasticities of five food groups consumed by households in Swaziland using the Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS), based on data from the 2009/2010 Swaziland Household Income and Expenditure Survey. Second, we use the estimated expenditure and compensated elasticities from the AIDS model, food shares from the household survey, and food price projections developed by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) to estimate the proportionate increase in income required to maintain the level of household utility that would have prevailed absent an increase in food prices. Our results show increases in cereal prices due to climate change are expected to double extreme poverty in urban areas and increase poverty in rural areas of the country to staggering levels - between 71 and 75%, compared to 63% before the price changes. Income transfers of between 17.5 and 25.4% of pre-change expenditures are needed to avoid the welfare losses."
898,D,"Potato late blight remains a threat to food security and livelihood of millions of people in Ethiopia. Despite a rapid dispersal of the disease pathogen and farmers' interdependency in managing it, the literature on agricultural extension and communication tends to frame the disease and its management as a problem of the individual farmer. This study appreciates late blight as a collective action problem whose management requires a corresponding re-configuration in information sharing and communicative practices. We employ a framed field game experiment with a mixed quantitative and qualitative method to explore how and to what extent different types and combinations of communicative interventions affect collective action in the management of the disease among farmers in Ethiopia. Interestingly, our quantitative findings revealed that the provision of technical information about interdependency involved in the management of the disease and social monitoring information about the management practices of other farmers negatively affected collective action. However, collective action performance significantly improved when farmers were given the opportunity to interactively communicate about their management strategies. Further qualitative investigation sheds light on how farmers used and made sense of the different communicative interventions to inform and adjust their individual decisions, coordinate collective strategies, pressure free-riders, and develop a shared identity. It is concluded that interventions that mainly promote the provision of technical and social information can be counterproductive in managing collective action problems such as late blight unless it is complemented with interactive communication and deliberation processes."
899,D,"The lockdown in Britain has rendered a large proportion of the population economically vulnerable and has at least quadrupled demand for emergency food relief. This paper looks critically at response to the crisis from the government and the voluntary sector with respect to provision of emergency food. In doing so, it has exposed gaps in understanding of the vagaries of the food supply for certain population groups and systemic weaknesses in the current system of emergency food aid. We make recommendations for healthier governmental capacity to react to a food security crisis, better relationships between the government and the voluntary sector, and further research into the dietary constraints of the precariate. Importantly, the social system needs to be responsive to short-term changes in people's income if people are not to fall into food insecurity."
900,D,"Food insecurity (FI) is a major social and public health problem worldwide. Hence, it is crucial to understand the effects of different government programs on overcoming FI. The present population-based longitudinal cohort study aimed to evaluate the association between government programs and household FI among families in a municipality in a semiarid area in Northeast, Brazil. We collected data on 358 families (2011) at baseline and 326 at follow-up (2014). FI was measured with the Brazilian Household Food Insecurity Measurement Scale (EBIA). The access to 27 governmental programs was assessed. The association of 15 programs with FI was estimated using logistic regression models and corresponding marginal effects and predicted probabilities. About 24.5% of families who were food insecure in 2011 became food secure in 2014 and 37.4% of families remained food secure across time. More than 90% of families accessed at least one program at baseline, and during follow-up there was an increase in the number of programs received per family. Programs in the areas of health protection, food and water assistance, poverty reduction, and rural developmentwere associated with remaining food secure over time and overcoming FI between baseline and follow-up. In conclusion, access to diverse health, food and social government programs was related to reduced risk of FI. This evidence strongly supports the need to for multisectoral approaches to address the social determinants of health to confront FI."
901,D,"As these lines were written, the Covid-19 pandemic crisis was continuing to threaten countries around the globe. The worldwide consensus that physical distancing is an effective instrument for mitigating the spread of the virus has led policymakers to temporarily limit the freedom of movement of people between and within countries, cities, and even neighborhoods. These public health-related restrictions on human mobility yielded an unprecedented fragmentation of international and national food distribution systems. Focusing on food retailing - usually being modestly oligopolistic - we take a micro-economic perspective as we analyze the potential consequences this disruption has for the physical as well as for the economic access of households to food at the local level. As the mobility constraints implemented substantially reduced competition, we argue that food retailers might have been tempted to take advantage of the implied fragmentation of economic activity by exploiting their temporarily raised market power at the expense of consumers and farmers. We illustrate our point by providing empirical evidences of rising wholesale-retail as well as farm-retail price margins observed during the Covid-19 crisis. Subsequently, we review existing empirical approaches that can be used to quantify and decompose the micro-economic effects of crises on food demand and supply as well as the size and structure of the market, costs of trade, and economic welfare. The employment of such approaches facilitates policymakers' understanding of micro-economic effects of public health-induced mobility restrictions on economic activity."
902,D,"To overcome pressing food system challenges, academics and civil society actors have called for the development of integrated food policies. Municipalities have increasingly picked up on these calls by developing municipal food strategies. It remains unclear, however, whether and how these commitments have resulted in a genuine institutionalization of food governance across local administrations. We address this gap through an in-depth study of how food governance ideas were institutionalized in the Dutch municipality of Ede, which is considered a frontrunner in municipal food policy. Drawing on discursive institutionalism, we explore how actors, ideas and discourses mutually shaped the institutionalization process. Our analysis shows that food governance ideas were institutionalized following a discursive-institutional spiral of three stages. First, an abstract food profile discourse emerged, which was institutionalized exclusively amongst a small group of policy makers. In the second stage, the discourse shifted to a more elaborate integrated food policy discourse, which was institutionalized across various departments. Finally, a food system discourse emerged, which was institutionalized across an even broader range of policy departments. Our study suggests that integrated food policy can be institutionalized within a relatively short time span. A food strategy, budget and organizational innovations seem key in this process, although they can also be constraining. At the same time, we conclude that retaining a food policy institutionalized remains challenging, as sudden ideational change may cause rapid deinstitutionalization."
903,D,"Violent political conflict has been documented to have comprehensive adverse effects on economic activity and, thus, substantially harm social welfare. As conflict escalations are often reported to fragment economic space, we suggest an empirical framework which allows for estimating changes in the size of markets often split by frontlines. This approach uses a differentiated goods oligopoly model to separate effects of conflict intensity on consumer demand, costs of trade, market size, and market structure. We combine daily sales of apples in Hebron - one of the focal points of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict - and variables quantifying complementary aspects of conflict intensity. Conflict is found to suppress demand and affect competition more significantly than it increases costs of trading. Simulations indicate a 15% reduction in total daily consumption during conflict of high intensity while a pacification would yield a 20% welfare gain. This empirical framework allows disentangling the effects of conflict on food markets. The results suggest that relief policies should consider alleviating effects of fragmentation of economic space, e.g., by ensuring humanitarian corridors."
904,D,"Genetic variation in wheat is needed to address global food security challenges, particularly as climates change. Crop wild relatives are unique reservoirs of useful alleles for crop improvement and are important components of genebank collections. We analyzed how the derivatives of 'goat grass' (Aegilops tauschii) have been used to widen the genetic base for wheat breeding and surveyed wheat breeders to elicit adoption estimates. Synthetic hexaploid wheat (SHW) is derived by crossing goat grass with durum wheat, serving as a bridge to transfer desirable traits into modern varieties of bread wheat. Our data show that wheat scientists used 629 unique accessions from 15 countries for pre-breeding, producing 1577 primary SHWs. These derivatives represented 21% of the germplasm distributed by the genebank of the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center between 2000 and 2018. Over the period, more than 10,000 samples of SHW were sent to 110 institutions in 40 countries, with rising numbers of synthetic hexaploid-derived lines (SHDL) included in international nurseries. Lines were screened for major diseases of wheat. At least 86 varieties have been selected from SHDL and released in 20 countries. Survey estimates indicate the highest scale of adoption in southwest China and India, with 34% and 7% of reported wheat area, respectively. These varieties demonstrate resistance to pests and pathogens, high yield potential, good quality attributes, and suitability for biofortified wheat."
905,H,"A tiling of the Euclidean plane, by regular polygons, is called 2-uniform tiling if it has two orbits of vertices under the action of its symmetry group. There are 20 distinct 2-uniform tilings of the plane. Plane being the universal cover of torus and Klein bottle, it is natural to ask about the exploration of maps on these two surfaces corresponding to the 2-uniform tilings. We call such maps as doubly semiequivelar maps. In the present study, we compute and classify (up to isomorphism) doubly semiequivelar maps on torus and Klein bottle. This classification of semiequivelar maps is useful in classifying a category of symmetrical maps which have two orbits of vertices, named as 2-uniform maps."
906,H,"This paper presents an abstract approach of analysing population growth in the field of algebraic topology using the tools of homology theory. For a topological space X and any point vn is an element of X, where vn is the n-dimensional surface, the group eta X,vn is called population of the space X. The increasing sequence from vin is an element of X to vjn is an element of X for i<j provides the bases for the population growth. A growth in population eta X,vn occurs if vin<vjn for all vin is an element of X and vjn is an element of X. This is described by the homological invariant H eta k=1. The aim of this paper is to construct the homological invariant H eta k and use H eta k=1 to analyse the growth of the population. This approach is based on topological properties such as connectivity and continuity. The paper made extensive use of homological invariant in presenting important information about the population growth. The most significant feature of this method is its simplicity in analysing population growth using only algebraic category and transformations."

Furthermore, under appropriate conditions, the horizontal algorithm converges both weakly and strongly to a common fixed point of a finite family of type-one demicontractive mappings. It is also applied to obtain some new algorithms for approximating a common solution of an equilibrium problem and the fixed point problem for a finite family of mappings. Our work is a contribution to ongoing research on iteration schemes for approximating a common solution of fixed point problems of a finite family of mappings and equilibrium problems."

Our results extend and improve very recent theorems in the related literature."
913,H,"The unmanned systems have been seeing a significant boom in the last ten years in different areas together with technological developments. One of the unmanned systems is unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). UAVs are used for reconnaissance and observation in the military areas and play critical role in attack and destroy missions. These vehicles have been winning more features together with developing technology in todays world. In addition, they have been varying with different features. A systematic and efficient approach for the selection of the UAV is necessary to choose a best alternative for the critical tasks under consideration. The multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) approaches that are analytic processes are well suited to deal intricacy in selection of alternative vehicles. This study also proposes an integrated methodology based on the analytic hierarch process (AHP) and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) to evaluate UAV alternatives for selection process. Firstly, AHP, a MCDM method, is used to determine the weights of each critical factor. Subsequently, it is utilized with the TOPSIS approach to rank the vehicle alternatives in the decision problem. Result of the study shows that UAV-1 was selected as the most suitable vehicle. In results, it is seen that the weights of the evaluation criteria found by using AHP affect the decision-making process. Finally, the validation and sensitivity analysis of the solution are made and discussed."

921,H,"Selective harvesting plays an important role on the dynamics of predator-prey interaction. On the other hand, the effect of predator self-limitation contributes remarkably to the stabilization of exploitative interactions. Keeping in view the selective harvesting and predator self-limitation, a discrete-time predator-prey model is discussed. Existence of fixed points and their local dynamics is explored for the proposed discrete-time model. Explicit principles of Neimark-Sacker bifurcation and period-doubling bifurcation are used for discussion related to bifurcation analysis in the discrete-time predator-prey system. The control of chaotic behavior is discussed with the help of methods related to state feedback control and parameter perturbation. At the end, some numerical examples are presented for verification and illustration of theoretical findings."

925,H,"This paper proposes an innovativesemiparametric nonlinear fuzzy-EGARCH-ANNmodel to solve the problem of accurate modeling for forecasting stock market volatility. This model has been developed by a combination of the FIS, ANN, and EGARCH models. Because the proposed model is highly nonlinear and gradient-based parameter estimation methods might not give global optimal parameters for highly nonlinear models, the study has decided to use evolutionary algorithms instead. In particular, a differential evolution (DE) algorithm is suggested to solve the parameter estimation problem of the proposed model. After this, the semiparametric nonlinear fuzzy-EGARCH-ANN model has been developed mathematically from the three models mentioned before, and the study has simulated data by it. After the simulation, parameter estimation of the proposed model using a differential evolution algorithm on the simulated data is done. Finally, it is seen that the proposed model is good in capturing the volatility clustering and leverage effects of highly nonlinear and complicated financial time series data that were overlooked by the EGARCH model."

Based on the approximation equation, we construct the corresponding numerical algorithms for the fractional initial value problem. Finally, we use some examples to illustrate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed technique."

Firstly, the fuzzy set theory is used to transform the fuzzy difference equation into the corresponding ordinary difference equations with parameters. Then, the expression for the periodic solution of the max-type ordinary difference equations is obtained by the iteration, the inequality technique, and the mathematical induction. Moreover, we can obtain the expression for the periodic solution of the max-type fuzzy difference equation. In addition, the boundedness and persistence of solutions for the fuzzy difference equation is proved. Finally, the results of this paper are simulated and verified by using MATLAB 2016 software package."

929,H,We define a generalization of the winding number of a piecewise cycle in the complex plane which has a geometric meaning also for points which lie on the cycle. The computation of this winding number relies on the Cauchy principal value but is also possible in a real version via an integral with bounded integrand. The new winding number allows to establish a generalized residue theorem which covers also the situation where singularities lie on the cycle. This residue theorem can be used to calculate the value of improper integrals for which the standard technique with the classical residue theorem does not apply.

By using this relation we have shown that ordered quasi-Gamma-ideals and ordered bi-Gamma-ideals in ordered Gamma-semirings are generalization of quasi-ideals and bi-ideals in ordered semirings. Properties of many types of ordered Gamma-ideals including (semi)prime, (strongly) irreducible, and maximal ordered quasi-Gamma-ideals and ordered bi-Gamma-ideals in ordered Gamma-semirings S have been studied."

940,H,"Due to noncontinuous solution, impulsive differential equations with delay may have a measurable right side and not a continuous one. In order to support handling impulsive differential equations with delay like in other chapters of differential equations, we formulated and proved existence and uniqueness theorems for impulsive differential equations with measurable right sides following Caratheodory's techniques. The new setup had an impact on the formulation of initial value problems (IVP), the continuation of solutions, and the structure of the system of trajectories. (a) We have two impulsive differential equations to solve with one IVP (phi(sigma(0)) = xi(0)) which selects one of the impulsive differential equations by the position of sigma(0) in [a, b(gamma)]. Solving the selected IVP fully determines the solution on the other scale with a possible delay. (b) The solutions can be continued at each point of (alpha, beta) x Omega(0) = Omega by the conditions in the existence theorem. (c) These changes alter the flow of solutions into a directed tree. This tree however is an in-tree which offers a modelling tool to study among other interactions of generations."

945,I,"Wavelength-structured transparent conductive oxide (TCO) electrodes are highly promising to improve both the optical and electrical performance of photovoltaic (PV) devices, due to wave-optical light-trapping (LT) effects and higher TCO volume without increasing optical losses. Herein we present a complete study of the benefits of microstructured IZO contacts applied on amorphous-silicon (a-Si) thin film solar cells. The IZO LT structures were integrated by an innovative colloidal lithography process on the front contact of the cells, resulting in enhancements of 263% in photocurrent, with respect to planar reference cells, when using an ultra-thin (30 nm) flat IZO layer between the LT structures and the a-Si absorber. However, the best efficiency enhancement (23.1%) was attained with an optimized thickness of 190 nm for this layer, due to a more favorable combination of optical and electrical gains. In view of the application of this LT strategy in flexible PV devices operating under bending, the angular response of the cells was studied for 0-90 degrees incidence angles. This showed that the LT enhancements are generally higher at oblique incidence, reaching 53.2% and 52%, respectively in photocurrent and efficiency, at +/- 70 degrees angles with the optimized flat IZO thickness of 190 nm; and 52.2% in efficiency at +/- 40 degrees with the ultra-thin thickness of 30 nm. These results are among the highest gains reported thus far for LT-enhanced thin film solar cells."
946,I,"A laboratory-scale solar reactor prototype dedicated to calcination processes of non-metallic mineral particles is tested and characterized. The prototype consists of an indirect heating shallow cross-flow fluidized-bed reactorreceiver. It is composed of 4 compartments in series in which the particles are thermally treated with solar power in order to drive the endothermic calcination reaction. The particles are fluidized in the reactor with preheated air and are heated up to 800 degrees C through the front wall of the reactor receiving the concentrated solar flux (about 200 kW/m(2)). The tests are carried out at the 1-MW Odeillo's solar furnace (France). The thermal decomposition of a continuous stream of 9.4 kg/h of dolomite (CaMg(CO3)(2)) is investigated in this paper. The half decomposition of dolomite (CaMg(CO3)(2) -> CaCO3 + MgO + CO2) is performed with a degree of conversion of 100%. The complete decomposition of dolomite (CaMg(CO3)(2) -> CaO + MgO + 2CO(2)) is not reached because, with respect to the CO 2 partial pressure in the reactor, the temperature of particles is not high enough to decompose the calcium carbonate. The calculated thermochemical efficiency (i.e. the energy absorbed by the endothermic calcination reaction compared to the solar energy provided to the system) is 6.6%. This low efficiency is neither surprising nor critical since the reactor design was not optimised with respect to energy efficiency but designed to the control of particle flow and front wall solar flux distribution. A numerical model considering the 4 compartments of the reactor as 4 ideal continuous stirred tank reactors in series is developed. The model accounts for the mass and the energy balances, as well as the reaction kinetics of the half decomposition of dolomite. The model gives consistent results compared to the experimental data. These results are a proof of concept of continuous calcination reaction using concentrated solar energy in a cross-flow fluidized-bed reactor."
947,I,"Photovoltaic (PV) already proves but even more promises to be massively deployed worldwide. To evaluate the performance of PV systems globally and assess risk due to different climate conditions, we propose a methodology for the global Koppen-Geiger-Photovoltaic (KGPV) climate classification that divides the globe into 12 zones with regard to the temperature, precipitation and irradiation, and standardizes the evaluations of the performance in regions with similar climatic conditions. Additionally, we present implications of KGPV to simulated PV performance using monthly data, for current and future operation of PV systems worldwide including climate change scenarios. A set of electrical and thermal performance indicators of crystalline silicon PV modules in different KGPV zones is analyzed and their evolution over time due to climate changes caused by high greenhouse gas emissions discussed. Results show that the KGPV scheme proves to be a convenient methodology to relate the KGPV climate zones with PV performance."
948,I,"Structural and morphological properties of CH3NH3PbI3 thin films deposited by spin coating, with different spin speeds on glass and ITO patterned substrates were investigated. It results that long length acicular crystals, growth parallel to substrates (> 200 mu m for spin speeds of 800RPM/min). For low deposition spin speed these crystals are interconnected and deposited films present a high electrical conductivity. The XRD investigations indicate the formation generally of the cubic phase, or a mixture between cubic and tetragonal phase. For compact films the absorption is high over a large range of spectral domain (from 200 nm to 2100 nm), the transmission being lower than 20% in IR and less than 15% in the visible domain. From electrical properties point of view, films are highly sensitive to light. An increase of the electrical conductivity with three order of magnitude is noticed when films are exposed to a white light of a solar simulator with an intensity of 1000 W/m(2), but also an important increase is observed when films are exposed to a continuous low intensity ambient light, at least one order of magnitude in less than six seconds. This behavior is identical no matter the films thickness. The variation of the electrical conductivity at exposure to light in function of time and light intensity and the variation of the electrical conductivity in function of temperature were investigated and interpreted. The experimental results, since now, comforting the assumption of a multiband model."
949,I,"Sunshape and reflector surface slope error distributions are significant elements in modelling the optical behaviour of a concentrating solar power system. Different optical modelling tools implement these elements with various approaches. Discrepancies can easily accumulate in simulations of a large optical system as a result of incorrect implementations. This study reviews and verifies the implementations of these two factors in six tools that are widely used for optical modelling in solar energy research: Tonatiuh, SolTrace, Tracer, Solstice, Heliosim and SolarPILOT. The review incorporates three rounds of tests. Firstly, basic tests examine each factor carefully in simplified on-axis reflector-target configurations (round 'A'). Secondly, off-axis effects are introduced (round 'B'). Thirdly, full heliostat field simulations are verified (round 'C'). All of the test cases are simulated with each modelling tool, and results are compared. Discrepancies were observed due to approximations inherent in the cone optics (convolution) methods, incorrect implementation the of pillbox slope errors, different approaches to setting the circumsolar ratio for the Buie sunshape, and different approaches to the calculation of blocking and shading losses in some tools. All issues are discussed fully, and solutions to most issues were implemented within the scope of the present study. Some remaining issues are noted. The study highlights the importance of careful implementation of these aspects of optical modelling and contributes to an improvement in the quality of several widely-used tools."
950,I,"Semi-transparent photovoltaic (PV) technology is attractive for building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) due to its ability to lower the admitted solar heat gain, to control the penetrating daylight and to generate onsite benevolent direct current power. In this work, semi-transparent cadmium telluride (CdTe) based BIPV as window was experimentally characterized using outdoor test cell in temperate UK climate. Spectral measurement confirmed its 25% visible transmission and 12% solar transmission. Thermal transmission and solar heat gain coefficient were calculated from measured thermal data. Overall heat transfer coefficient (U-value) of 2.7 W/m(2) K was found for outdoor and indoor characterization of CdTe BIPV window. A comparison with single glazed window has been produced emphasis its feasibility for Facade buildings."
951,I,"Soiling is a challenge for both concentrating solar and photovoltaic technologies. Measurement procedures and efficiency sensitivities to soiling for the same surface particle density differ due to the different optical characteristics of both technologies. For this reason, soiling investigations performed at a site for one technology are not necessarily applicable to the other technology. Soiling measurements have been performed mostly under fixed or rarely occurring angles of incidence. In this study parallel measurements of soiling loss and particle mass density found on the main optical surfaces of concentrating solar power (CSP) and photovoltaic (PV) technologies are presented. The measurements are taken on samples of CSP second surface mirror and PV solar glass with consideration of the main optical characteristics of both technologies. Optical soiling losses are found to be higher by a factor of 8-14 in CSP for the same particle surface densities compared to PV. A Mie-based model is presented and validated, that converts the particle mass density and a set of other inputs into the optical soiling loss for either technology for normal angle of incidence and varying angles of incidence. This method facilitates the transfer of soiling loss data from one technology to another. The method can significantly increase the knowledge on soiling for both technologies as more measurement data is made accessible. Additionally, the soiling losses for different angles of incidence can be used to estimate more realistic annual loss parameters for the technologies in question and give recommendations for optimized incidence angles to be used in soiling measurements for both technologies."
952,I,"Photovoltaic (PV) modules are sensitive to the spectral distribution of solar irradiance. Although numerical weather prediction (NWP) models compute irradiance in several spectral bands, only broadband quantities are provided in the standard outputs used for PV forecasts. This study investigates how this lack of information impacts PV power estimation. A physical PV model is first designed that accounts for the spectral distribution of irradiance and the spectral response of the panels. This model is evaluated using measurements performed at Site Instrumental de Recherche par Teledetection Atrnospherique (SIRTA), Palaiseau, France. The mean relative difference between simulated and measured PV power for a monocrystalline silicon module of 250 W nominal power is -0.9%, and the mean bias is -2.0 W. This model is then used to investigate the impact of solar zenith angle and clouds on the performance of PV modules. PV performance can increase in cloudy conditions by 5% through spectral filtering of near-infrared irradiance, and by 18% when only the useful irradiance is considered to compute performance. This spectral effects is not captured by the PV model when only broadband irradiances are used. In such case errors up to 15% are obtained in simulated PV power compared to using a state-of-the-art NWP model providing irradiance in 14 spectral bands. More generally, broadband global horizontal irradiance appears insufficient for accurate PV power modelling, highlighting the added value of spectrally-and-angularly-refined irradiances. This stresses that PV models should use more detailed irradiance inputs, which could be easily achieved by exploiting internal variables of NWP models."
953,I,"PV/T (photovoltaic/thermal) technology is a combination of PV module (photovoltaic utilization) and collector (photothermal utilization), which can improve the comprehensive utilization efficiency of solar energy and has a broad application prospect. In this paper, PV/T module is coupled with heat pump evaporator to form a direct-expansion solar PV/T heat pump which is suitable for heat application in high latitude area. To achieve stable residential heating, a solar PV/T heat pump system coupled with build-in PCM (phase change material) heat storage is therefore proposed and simulated. Meanwhile, the mathematical model of solar PV/T heat pump coupled with build-in PCM heat storage system is established and verified. The simulation results show that the temperature of underfloor heating which using build-in PCM heat storage can reach 22-31 degrees C after 39 h when the circulating water is 40 degrees C. Moreover, the heating COP (Coefficient of Performance) increases with the increase of solar radiation, ambient temperature and area of PV/T collector, and decrease of wind speed, respectively. A 20 m(2) PV/T panel module can output 21.4% of the electricity to power grid when the solar radiation intensity is 600 W/m(2) and meet the heat demand of a 100 m(2) room while maintain the operation of the system. Meanwhile, the heating COP can reach 5.79 which is 70% higher than the conventional air conditioning system and the electrical, thermal, overall efficiencies are 17.77%, 55.76% and 75.49%, respectively."
954,I,"Two significant design strategies for mitigating building energy consumption are daylight redirection and solar energy harvesting. Effective daylighting implementation enhances the amount of useful natural light within a space and offsets the need for electric lighting. Solar energy harvesting systems can mitigate energy costs from mechanical systems by managing incoming thermal loads or capturing solar energy that can be used to supplement thermal systems in the building. While there are many available facade-based technologies that can perform daylighting or solar thermal energy harvesting, there remains a limitation in available systems that can perform both of them simultaneously. This paper, describes the design and experimental demonstration of a Liquid Filled Prismatic Louver (LFPL) system, which combines both energy-saving strategies. The LFPL system was installed in a south-facing room in New York City and evaluated for indoor daylight penetration and potential for thermal energy harvesting. Daylight redirection is achieved through the prismatic louver geometry and proper orientation, whereas thermal energy harvesting is achieved through IR absorption from the liquid (e.g., water) within the prisms. Daylighting performance was evaluated by illuminance measurements at key locations within the space, whereas thermal harvesting performance was evaluated through temperature measurements and thermal imaging analysis. We show that the LFPL system, with all prismatic elements oriented at the same angle, achieve a 2-fold and 8-fold enhancement in daylight redirection to the ceiling, for prism orientations of 10 degrees and 20 degrees, respectively. We also demonstrate the system's capability to adjust to specific lighting needs, within the space, through the dynamic individual orientation of prismatic elements; thus, achieving a concentrated ceiling illuminance enhancement of similar to 100 times and similar to 200 times at 2.5 and 4.3 m away from the window sill, providing workplane illuminance enhancement of 6 and 2 times more than in the case of the control room with regular windows. Furthermore, we show a reduction of potential heating loads at locations close to the window from the combination of infrared absorption in the water volume and the redirection of the incoming solar radiation, leading to a reduction of the workplane temperature by an average of 7-10 degrees C."
955,I,"Loop thermosyphon (LT) is usually introduced to overcome the freezing and corrosion problems associated with the conventional solar water heating (SWH) system. Compared with the conventional SWH system, the LT-SWH system possesses a lower nighttime heat loss because of the thermal diode property of loop thermpsyphon but bigger daytime heat loss because of the secondary heat exchange. However, the effect of above interaction to the system performance is rarely reported based on long-term running. In this study, based on the typical meteorological year data of Fuzhou city, annual performances of above two systems, including the effective number of supplying days, effective heat gain and nighttime heat loss, are comparatively analyzed under two different operational modes. Variations of above mentioned variables with the increment in the set temperature are discussed. The results indicate that, under the discontinuous heating mode, the effective numbers of supplying days of SWH system and LT-SWH system are 139 and 153, respectively. While the numbers of days are respectively 168 and 173 under the continuous heating mode. The SWH system possesses an expected bigger nighttime heat loss ratio with an average annual value of 15.07% corresponding to 6.15% for the LT-SWH system. Particularly, for the LT-SWH system, the different relative magnitudes of heat loss coefficients functioning at different times leads to a smaller temperature drop at night and also a smaller temperature rise at the subsequent day. It generates an unanticipated results that corresponds to the same month from November to April, the two systems have the approximate effective heat gain. The set temperature significantly influences the relative magnitudes of annual effective number of supplying days and annual effective heat gain, the superiority of LT-SWH system gradually diminishes and even reverses with the increment in the set temperature. The bigger daytime heat loss dominating the dominance is responsible for that transition. Combining with a longer static payback period, it is conditional to substitute the conventional SWH system with the LT-SWH system, especially when the water temperature on demand is high."
956,I,"This paper reports the development and application of a new practical photovoltaic (PV) cells based device to measure the solar radiation flux produced by non-imaging Compound Parabolic Concentrators (CPCs) on cylindrical absorbers. The flexible experimental device comprises 12 discrete miniature PV panels that measure solar radiation on the surface of a cylindrical absorber. The device has been used to evaluate the performance of an asymmetric CPC system and results validated with a computer-based Ray Tracing Model. The study attained significant agreement between outdoor results of the experimental device and results of the ray tracing simulation with a difference of <9% in optical efficiencies. The non-imaging reflector illuminates a targeted section of the absorber of a horizontal east-west thermal diode Integrated Collector Storage Solar Water Heater. During outdoor testing, the experiments indicated a local concentration ratio reaching 1.4 suns on the targeted section of the absorber vessel surface for incidence angles - 30 degrees <= theta(i) <= 30 degrees, confirming technical suitability of the asymmetric CPC for deployment in locations at equatorial latitudes."
957,I,"A possibility of developing an environmental-friendly photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) solar panel, which can shut high temperature radiation within a panel box, was experimentally confirmed. The panel has a decompression-boiling heat collector, which can absorb heat from the PV module and can keep the air and the cover glass inside the panel box at lower temperature by using lower boiling temperature of working fluid under vacuum condition. The panel also has an emboss-processed cover glass, which can totally reflect the high temperature heat radiation from the PV module within the panel box. The experimental results using a single PV/T system showed that it could keep the heat radiation temperature from the PV/T solar panel surface around 45 degrees C even in summer; it provided the hot water at least 60 degrees C by controlling the flow-rate; and it produced 71.3% of solar energy in total as electricity and 40 degrees C heat, in summer, Yokohama, Japan. Highly efficient utilization of solar energy with small environmental heat-load would be possible by using the proposed PV/T system."
958,I,"Cu2SnS3 (CTS) solar cells, which have the highest conversion efficiency, are fabricated under Cu-poor conditions and Na addition. We investigated the contribution of these conditions to solar cell efficiency through photoluminescence observation. Samples were prepared by solid state reaction and classified into six types: Cu-poor, stoichiometric, Cu-rich, and with and without Na. The exciton luminescence was observed in both Cu-rich samples. In all samples, luminescence bands were observed at energies less than 0.9 eV, and these were determined to be donor-acceptor pair (DAP) recombination luminescence bands. The estimated activation energy of the DAP recombination luminescence of CTS was smaller with Na than without. Therefore, it is believed that the conversion efficiency improvement by Na addition is due to increased carrier density because the acceptor level approaches the valence band."
959,J,"The selectivity of nucleic acid hybridisation can be exploited to template chemical reactions, enabling materials discovery by chemical evolution. However, to date the range of reactions that can be used has been limited to those that are compatible with aqueous media, since the addition of organic co-solvents can have a large impact on the stability of nucleic acid duplexes. Peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) are promising in this regard because previous studies have suggested they may be stable as duplexes in high organic content solvent mixtures. Here, we use micro-differential scanning calorimetry (micro-DSC) to confirm for the first time that double-stranded PNA (dsPNA) is stable in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)/water mixtures up to 95 vol% DMF. Using fluorescence, we corroborate these results and show that the isothermal annealing of PNA in high DMF content solution is also rapid. These findings suggest that PNA could enable the use of a range of water-sensitive chemistries in nucleic acid templating applications."
960,J,"Insight into the catalytic mechanism of Lactobacillus leichmannii nucleoside 2 '-deoxyribosyltransferase (LlNDT) has been gained by calculating a quantum mechanics-molecular mechanics (QM/MM) free-energy landscape of the reaction within the enzyme active site. Our results support an oxocarbenium species as the reaction intermediate and thus an S(N)1 reaction mechanism in this family of bacterial enzymes. Our mechanistic proposal is validated by comparing experimental kinetic data on the impact of the single amino acid replacements Tyr7, Glu98 and Met125 with Ala, Asp and Ala/norLeu, respectively, and accounts for the specificity shown by this enzyme on a non-natural substrate. This work broadens our understanding of enzymatic C-N bond cleavage and C-N bond formation."
961,J,"This paper describes the development, optimisation and exemplification of a copper-catalysed C-H functionalisation to form pharmaceutically relevant 2-aminobenzimidazoles from aryl-guanidines. High throughput screening was used as a tool to identify a catalytically active copper source, DoE was used for reaction optimisation and a range of aryl-guanidines were prepared and exposed to the optimum conditions to afford a range of 2-aminobenzimidazoles in moderate to good yields. The methodology has been applied to the synthesis of Emedastine, a marketed anti-histamine pharmaceutical compound, with the key cyclisation step performed on a gram-scale."
962,J,"The four-arm nanomechanical switch 1 with four different terminals exhibits two switching arms (contacts A and D) and two distinct stations for binding (contacts B and C). In switching State I, the azaterpyridine arm is intramolecularly coordinated to a zinc(ii) porphyrin station (connection A <-> B) while contact D (a ferrocenylbipyridine unit) and contact C (phenanthroline) remain disconnected. After addition of copper(i) ions (State II) both connections A <-> B and C <-> D are established. Upon one-electron oxidation, double-pole change-over switching cleaves both connections A <-> B & C <-> D and establishes the new connection A <-> C (State III). Fully reversible three-state switching (State I -> State II -> State III -> State II -> State I) was achieved by adding appropriate chemical and redox stimuli."
963,J,"d-Amino acid oxidase (DAAO) is a flavoenzyme whose inhibition is expected to have therapeutic potential in schizophrenia. DAAO catalyses hydride transfer from the substrate to the flavin in the reductive half-reaction, and the flavin is reoxidized by O-2 in the oxidative half-reaction. Quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical calculations were performed and their results together with available experimental information were used to elucidate the detailed mechanism of the oxidative half-reaction. The reaction starts with a single electron transfer from FAD to O-2, followed by triplet-singlet transition. FAD oxidation is completed by a proton coupled electron transfer to the oxygen species and the reaction terminates with H2O2 formation by proton transfer from the oxidized substrate to the oxygen species via a chain of water molecules. The substrate plays a double role by facilitating the first electron transfer and by providing a proton in the last step. The mechanism differs from the oxidative half-reaction of other oxidases."
964,J,"A one-pot three-component tandem reaction involving a key Pictet-Spengler-like annulation step has been developed, providing an efficient method for the synthesis of 3,4-dihydroquinazolines in moderate to good yields from amides, aldehydes, and amines.

965,J,"The Sondheimer dialkyne is extensively used in double strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloadditions. This reagent suffers with poor water-solubility and rapidly decomposes in aqueous solutions. This intrinsically limits its application in biological systems, and no effective solutions are currently available. Herein, we report the development of novel highly water-soluble, stable, and azide-reactive strained dialkyne reagents. To demonstrate their extensive utility, we applied our novel dialkynes to a double strain-promoted macrocyclisation strategy to generate functionalised p53-based stapled peptides for inhibiting the oncogenic p53-MDM2 interaction. These functionalised stapled peptides bind MDM2 with low nanomolar affinity and show p53 activation in a cellular environment. Overall, our highly soluble, stable and azide-reactive dialkynes offer significant advantages over the currently used Sondheimer dialkyne, and could be utilised for numerous biological applications."
966,J,"Diels-Alder reaction of 2-, 3-and 4-(phenylethynyl)quinolines and tetraphenylcyclopentadienone gave three regioisomeric 2,3,4,5,6-pentaphenyl-1-(quinolin-2-yl, -3-yl, and -4-yl)benzenes. Restricted rotation of the 3-yl and 4-yl substituted derivatives is observed between the central core and the substituents, resulting in propeller-shaped molecules. Likewise, 1,2-diquinolinyl-3,4,5,6-tetraphenylbenzenes with 3-yl, 3-yl and 3-yl, 4-yl connectivity were prepared. As evidenced by NMR spectroscopy, they form two diasteromers due to their restricted rotation. A cobalt-catalyzed [2 + 2 + 2]-cyclotrimerization of 2-(phenylethynyl)quinoline resulted in the formation of triphenyl-2,4,6-and -3,5,6-tri(quinolin-2-yl) benzenes. The same reaction was applied to 3,3'-ethyne-1,2-diyldiquinoline which formed hexa(quinolin-3-yl)benzene. N-Methylation gave the title compounds. Among those, the hexacationic hexa(N-methylquinolinio- 3-yl) benzene is described. Stereochemical aspects are predominantly discussed by means of results of NMR experiments. DFT-calculations on the most stable conformations and the frontier orbital profiles of the hexacation as well as of its neutral precursor have been carried out."
967,J,"A new chiral phosphine oxide based on a 3,3 '-bithiophene scaffold (TetraPh-Tol-BITIOPO) was synthesized, fully characterized and separated into antipodes through chiral HPLC. This new compound was successfully employed as an organocatalyst in Lewis base-catalyzed Lewis acid mediated reactions involving trichlorosilyl compounds. The new atropisomeric catalyst was able to promote the allylation of aldehydes with allyltrichlorosilane in up to 98% yield and up to 96% enantiomeric excess (ee), and the direct aldol reaction to afford beta-hydroxy ketones and beta-hydroxy thioesters, with good chemical yields and modest stereochemical efficiency. Computational studies helped to elucidate and to rationalize the stereochemical outcome of the reactions catalyzed by TetraPh-Tol-BITIOPO that was found to favour the formation of the isomer with an opposite absolute configuration in comparison with the products obtained with the previously reported 3,3 '-bithiophene-based catalyst."
968,J,"In this work, we present a series of newly synthesized conjugated oligothiophene derivatives, with different numbers of central thiophene units, and different donor/ acceptor architectures. Electrochemical and spectroscopic data have also been reported. We used thiophene or bithiophene as central donor core units, 3-octylthiophenes as pi-bridge and solubilizing sub-units, and ethyl cyanoacetate or rhodanine moieties as acceptor end groups, in order to get D-pi-A and A-pi-D-pi-A molecular architectures. The length of the synthesized oligothiophenes ranges from three to eight thiophene units, a variety that is sufficient to put in evidence different optical and electrochemical characteristics as well as semiconducting characteristics. Oligothiophene compounds can be regarded not only as models for the study of structure-property relationships relative to polythiophenes, but also they present a large number of applications in the field of organic electronics (i. e.: as donors in bulk-heterojunction solar cells and hole-transporting layer materials in perovskite solar cells, among others)."
969,J,"Molecular imprinting is a facile method to create guest-complementary binding sites in a cross-linked polymeric network. When performed within cross-linked micelles, the resulting molecularly imprinted nanoparticles (MINPs) exhibited an extraordinary ability to distinguish subtle structural changes in the guest, including the shift of a hydrophilic or hydrophobic group by 1 carbon and addition of a single methylene/methyl group. A high surface-cross-linking density prior to core-cross-linking was key to the high-fidelity imprinting, enhancing both the binding affinity of the imprinted micelle for the template and selectivity among structural analogues. Whereas the imprinted site closely complemented the hydrophilic surface anchoring group and rigid hydrophobic aromatic core, it was expanded significantly for a conformationally mobile small group (i.e., methoxy)."
970,J,The fluorinase enzyme from Streptomyces cattleya is shown to catalyse a direct displacement of bromide and iodide by fluoride ion from 5 '-bromodeoxyadenosine (5 '-BrDA) and 5 '-iododeoxyadenosine (5 '-IDA) respectively to form 5 '-fluorodeoxyadenosine (5 '-FDA) in the absence of l-methionine (l-Met) or S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM). 5 '-BrDA is the most efficient substrate for this enzyme catalysed Finkelstein reaction.
971,J,"Site- and regio-selective aromatic C-H bond benzoxylations were found to take place using biologically appealing N-arylisoindolinones under ruthenium(ii) catalysis in the presence of (hetero)aromatic carboxylic acid derivatives as coupling partners. Besides the presence of two potential C(sp(2))-H sites available for functionalization in the substrates, exclusive ortho selectivity was achieved in the phenyl ring attached to the nitrogen atom. Notably, the reactions occurred in a selective manner as only mono-functionalized products were formed and they tolerated a large number of functional chemical groups. The ability of the cyclic tertiary amide within the isoindolinone skeleton to act as a weak directing group in order to accommodate six-membered ring ruthenacycle intermediates appears to be the key to reach such high levels of selectivity. In contrast, the more sterically demanding cyclic imides were unreactive under identical reaction conditions."

973,J,"Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, NAD(+), is an essential cofactor and substrate for many cellular enzymes. Its sustained intracellular levels have been linked to improved physiological end points in a range of metabolic diseases. Biosynthetic precursors to NAD(+) include nicotinic acid, nicotinamide, the ribosylated parents and the phosphorylated form of the ribosylated parents. By combining solvent-assisted mechanochemistry and sealed reaction conditions, access to the ribosylated NAD(+) precursors and to the isotopologues of NAD(+) precursors was achieved in high yields and levels of purity. The latter is critical as it offers means to better trace biosynthetic pathways to NAD(+), investigate the multifaceted roles of the intracellular NAD(+) pools, and better exploit NAD(+) biology."

975,J,"Density functional theory calculations are reported which explore how a chiral sulfinyl substituent controls the stereoselectivities of the Diels-Alder reactions of a 2-p-tolylsulfinylbenzoquinone. The pi-facial stereoselectivities vary depending on the diene (cyclopentadiene or trans-piperylene) and on the presence or absence of a ZnBr2 catalyst. The stereoselectivities are shown to be controlled by steric effects and non-covalent (CH-pi) interactions. The calculations reveal that the active dienophile in the ZnBr2-catalyzed reactions is likely to be a 1 : 2 complex of the dienophile and catalyst, not a 1 : 1 complex as commonly assumed."

977,J,"Alginate, an anionic polysaccharide, is an important industrial biomaterial naturally harvested from seaweed. Many of its important physicochemical properties derive from the presence of charged carboxylate groups presented as uronic acids within the polysaccharide backbone. An ability to modify these carboxylates with alternate functional groups would enable the design and implementation of new alginate systems possessing different physicochemical properties. We present herein our approach to the chemical synthesis of alginate disaccharides, modified at the carboxylate C6 position with bioisosteric hydroxamate residues. The synthesis and utilisation of C6-hydroxamate donor and acceptor building blocks enables a first access to protected alpha- and beta-linked hydroxamate-containing disaccharides, additionally equipped with a functional tether at the reducing terminus. The evaluation of these building blocks for chemical glycosylation demonstrates the incorporation of bioisosteric functional groups into an alginate disaccharide backbone and highlights the important contribution of both acceptor and donor reactivity underpinning uronate glycosylations."

982,J,"Despite the importance of cyclobutanes there are not many direct [2 + 2] photocycloaddition reactions which can be performed with visible light in the absence of a catalyst. A notable exception is the reaction of 1-aryl-2-nitroethenes and olefins which can be performed at a wavelength of lambda = 419 nm or lambda = 424 nm in CH2Cl2 as the solvent. In the present study, a total of 15 1-aryl-2-nitroethenes were found to undergo a [2 + 2] photocycloaddition with 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene (28-86% yield) and a set of 12 olefins was studied in their photocycloaddition to 1-phenyl-2-nitroethene (37-88% yield).

983,J,"Melioidosis and glanders, respectively caused by the Gram-negative bacteria Burkholderia pseudomallei (Bp) and Burkholderia mallei (Bm), are considered as urgent public health issues in developing countries and potential bioterrorism agents. Bp and Bm lipopolysaccharides (LPS) have been identified as attractive vaccine candidates for the development of prophylactic measures against melioidosis and glanders. Bp and Bm express structurally similar LPSs wherein the O-antigen (OAg) portion consists of a heteropolymer whose repeating unit is a disaccharide composed of d-glucose and 6-deoxy-l-talose residues, the latter being diversely acetylated and methylated. Herein we report the synthesis of two tetrasaccharides mimicking the main substitution epitopes of Bp and Bm LPS OAgs. The assembly of the tetrasaccharides was achieved using a sequential glycosylation strategy while relying on the late-stage epimerization of the inner rhamnose into a 6-deoxy-l-talose residue. We show that these synthetic compounds strongly react with culture-confirmed Thai melioidosis patient serum and closely mimic the antigenicity of native Bp OAg. Our results suggest that these tetrasaccharides could be suitable candidates for the development of vaccines and/or diagnostic tools against melioidosis and glanders."

The aim is to identify ad hoc probe candidate(s) that might combine fast/reliable fluorogenic """"turn-on"""" response, full stability in complex biological media and ability to release a second molecule of interest (drug or second fluorescent reporter), for applications in disease diagnosis and therapy. We base our strategy on screening a set of active methylene compounds (C-nucleophiles) to convert the parent probe to various pyronin caged precursors bearing Michael acceptor moieties of differing reactivities. In vitro stability and fluorescent enzymatic assays combined with HPLC-fluorescence analyses provide data useful for defining the most appropriate structural features for these fluorogenic scaffolds depending on the specifications inherent to biological application (from biosensing to theranostics) for which they will be used."

986,J,"Bioorthogonal reactions can be performed selectively in the presence of any biological functional group and are widely used to achieve site-selective chemical modifications of biomolecules. The click-to-release reaction is a bioorthogonal bond-cleavage variant that has gained much interest over the last few years. The bioorthogonal reaction between tetrazines and trans-cyclooctenes or vinyl ethers, for example, initiates the release of a small molecule immediately after the cycloaddition with tetrazines. Recently, our group reported that vinylboronic acids (VBAs) give exceptionally high reaction rates in the bioorthogonal inverse electron-demand Diels-Alder reaction with tetrazines that are substituted with boron-coordinating ligands. In the present study, we show that VBAs can be used in a click-to-release variant and demonstrate its bioorthogonality with a VBA-protected doxorubicin prodrug. We show that the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin is silenced by the attachment of the VBA, and activity can be largely restored upon the reaction with a tetrazine, inducing cell death."
987,J,Double mutant cycles were constructed using neurotransmitters and synthetic substrates that measure their selective binding to one monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzyme isoform over another as a function of structural change. This work measures a reduction in selectivity for the MAOB isoform of 3 to 9.5 kJ mol(-1) upon the addition of hydroxy functional groups to a phenethylamine scaffold. Replacement of hydroxy functional groups on the phenethylamine scaffold by hydrophobic substituents measures an increase in selectivity for MAOB of -1.1 to -6.9 kJ mol(-1). The strategies presented here can be applied to the development of competitive reversible inhibitors of MAO enzymes and other targets with structurally related isoforms.

This has enabled the identification of systems active against Gram-positive bacteria, some of which show gyrase and RNA polymerase inhibitory activity. In particular, tetramates substituted with glycosyl side chains, chosen to impart polarity and aqueous solubility, show high antibacterial activity coupled with modest gyrase/polymerase activity in two cases. An analysis of physicochemical properties indicates that the antibacterially active tetramates generally occupy physicochemical space with MW of 300-600, clog D-7.4 of -2.5 to 4 and rel. PSA of 11-22%. This work demonstrates that biologically active 3D libraries are readily available by manipulation of a tetramate skeleton."
989,H,"For a set W = {w(1), w(2),...,w(k)} of vertices and a vertex v of a connected graph G, the k-multiset mr(v (vertical bar) W) = d(v, w(1)), d(v, w(2)),..., d(v, w(k))}, where d(v, w(i)) is the distance from v to w(i) for i = 1, 2,..., k, and is the multirepresentation of v with respect to W. The set W is a multiresolving set of G if the multirepresentations of every two distinct vertices of G with respect to W are distinct.

Case-cohort design in most of the existing literature is mainly used to analyze the univariate failure time data. But in practice, multivariate failure time data are commonly encountered in biomedical research. In this paper, we will propose methods based on estimating equation method for case-cohort designs for clustered survival data. By introducing the event failure rate, three different weight functions are constructed. Then, three estimating equations and parameter estimators are presented. Furthermore, consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed estimators are established. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed estimation procedure has reasonable finite sample behaviors."

The basic principle of this suggested technique and the specific solving process are presented in detail. Its validity and efficiency are then checked via rigid comparisons with other computational approaches. It is found that the homotopy-based convergence-control parameter and the wavelet-based resolution level of Coiflet are two effective ways to improve on accuracies of solutions."
994,H,"Let G be a graph of order n with vertices labeled as v(1), v(2),..., v(n). Let d(i) be the degree of the vertex v(i), for i. 1, 2,..., n.

Since this index is related to the degree of the vertices of the graph, our main tool will be an appropriate matrix, that is, a modification of the classical adjacency matrix involving the degrees of the vertices. In this paper, some properties of its characteristic polynomial are studied. We also investigate the difference energy of a graph. In addition, we establish some upper and lower bounds for this new energy of graph."

Under some acceptable conditions, the solution of the stochastic system oscillates in the vicinity of the disease-free equilibrium if the basic reproductive number R-0 <= 1, while the random solution oscillates near the endemic equilibrium, and the system has a unique stationary distribution if R-0 > 1. Moreover, numerical simulation is conducted to support our theoretical results."

1022,H,"The fixture design of the bacteria bottle plays a vital role in designing a bottled fungus picking robot to save labor cost in the picking process of bottled fungus. This paper proposed a kind of clamping element design method based on regression models. Several sets of clamping elements were designed according to the appearance data of bacteria bottle. A single-factor test was conducted by using these clamping elements, and three levels of every factor were selected to obtain the desired values of clamping elements. Then, a Box-Behnken test was performed by selected levels. The established regression models described a numeric relationship between the variation of vital measurement points and all variation sources under a precise clamping element layout. To solve the problems in obtaining the direct parameters, a response surface method was presented based on the regression models. Finally, a test was used to demonstrate the effect of the optimized clamping elements when clamping a bacteria bottle. Through the related analysis and optimization, it was demonstrated that the holding effect of the clamping elements was the best under these conditions: the inner arc area was 4948 mm(2); the downward displacement was 1.48 mm; and the rubber thickness was 3.69 mm. It showed that the proposed method was feasible, and the assembly quality after optimizing had been greatly improved. It can provide a reference for designing the bottle fixture of a picking machine."

1025,H,"The purpose of this study is to propose an integrated distance-based methodology for multiple attribute group decision making (MAGDM) within single-valued neutrosophic linguistic (SVNL) environments. A new SVNL distance measure, namely the SVNL integrated weighted distance (SVNLIWD) measure, is first developed for achieving the aim. The remarkable feature of the SVNLIWD is that it integrates both merits of ordered weighting and average weighting into aggregating SVNL distances; therefore, it can account for both the importance of aggregated deviations as well as ordered positions. Thus, it can highlight the decision makers' subjective risk attitudes and combine the importance of objective decision information. Some distinctive characteristics and special forms of the presented distance framework are then specifically studied. Moreover, a MAGDM model on the basis of the proposed SVNLIWD form is formulated. Finally, an illustrative numerical case regarding selecting low-carbon supplier is used to test the performance of the designed method."

Let M be a nonzero unital R-module, where R is a commutative ring with a nonzero identity. Suppose that S is a multiplicatively closed subset of R. A submodule P of M is said to be an S-semiprime submodule if there exists a fixed s is an element of S, and whenever rnm is an element of P for some r is an element of R,m is an element of M, and n is an element of N, then srm is an element of P. Also, M is said to be an S-reduced module if there exists (fixed) s is an element of S, and whenever rnm=0 for some r is an element of R,m is an element of M, and n is an element of N, then srm=0. In addition, to give many examples and characterizations of S-semiprime submodules and S-reduced modules, we characterize a certain class of semiprime submodules and reduced modules in terms of these concepts."

1050,H,"This paper deals with the multiobjective minimum cost flow (F-MOMCF) with fuzzy penalty characterized by trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Through the use of alpha-cut, the F-MOMCF problem is transformed into the alpha-MOMCF problem. The alpha-MOMCF problem can be solved using an interactive approach combined with the weighting Tchebycheff problem. The advantages of this method are that it elicits information from the decision maker (DM) to modify the given constraint set, it gives the optimum penalty, and the effort required for obtaining the solution is reduced. The stability set of the first kind related to the alpha-best compromise solution is determined. A numerical example is given for illustration and to check the validity of the approach."

1054,H,"A topological invariant is a numerical parameter associated with molecular graph and plays an imperative role in the study and analysis of quantitative structure activity/property relationships (QSAR/QSPR). The correlation between the entire pi-electron energy and the structure of a molecular graph was explored and understood by the first Zagreb index. Recently, Liu et al. (2019) calculated the first general Zagreb index of the F-sum graphs. In the same paper, they also proposed the open problem to compute the general Randic index R-alpha(Gamma) = Sigma(uv is an element of E(Gamma))[d(Gamma)(u) x d(Gamma)(v)](alpha) of the F-sum graphs, where alpha is an element of R and d(Gamma)(u) denote the valency of the vertex u in the molecular graph Gamma. Aim of this paper is to compute the lower and upper bounds of the general Randic index for the F-sum graphs when alpha is an element of N. We present numerous examples to support and check the reliability as well as validity of our bounds. Furthermore, the results acquired are the generalization of the results offered by Deng et al.

1055,H,"This article aims to study Newtonian fluid flow modeling and simulation through a rectangular channel embedded in a semicircular cylinder with the range of Reynolds number from 100 to 1500. The fluid is considered as laminar and Newtonian, and the problem is time independent. A numerical procedure of finite element's least Square technique is implemented through COMSOL multiphysics 5.4. The problem is validated through asymptotic solution governed through the screen boundary condition. The vortex length of the recirculating region formed at the back of the cylinder and orientation of velocity field and pressure will be discussed by three horizontal and four vertical lines along the recirculating region in terms of Reynolds number. It was found that the two vortices of unequal size have appeared and the lengths of these vortices are increased with the increase Reynolds number. Also, the empirical equations through the linear regression procedure were determined for those vortices. The orientation of the velocity magnitude as well as pressure along the lines passing through the center of upper and lower vortices are the same."

1060,H,"Uncertainty in data fusion applications has received great attention. Due to the effectiveness and flexibility in handling uncertainty, Dempster-Shafer evidence theory is widely used in numerous fields of data fusion. However, Dempster-Shafer evidence theory cannot be used directly for conflicting sensor data fusion since counterintuitive results may be attained. In order to handle this issue, a new method for data fusion based on weighted belief entropy and the negation of basic probability assignment (BPA) is proposed. First, the negation of BPA is applied to represent the information in a novel view. Then, by measuring the uncertainty of the evidence, the weighted belief entropy is adopted to indicate the relative importance of evidence. Finally, the ultimate weight of each body of evidence is applied to adjust the mass function before fusing by the Dempster combination rule. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated in accordance with an experiment on artificial data and an application on fault diagnosis."

In the end, we present the basins of attraction using some complex polynomials of different degrees to observe the fractal behavior and dynamical aspects of the proposed algorithms."
1063,I,"Thin film Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) solar cells can be grown on flexible and lightweight metal substrates allowing their direct integration on bendable surfaces and where the weight of solar cell is an important criterion. Flexible substrates make it possible to use the roll-to-roll technology of solar cells, which leads to an additional reduction in the cost of production and final cost of solar cells. The CZTSe thin films were fabricated by selenization of electrodeposited metallic precursors onto tantalum (Ta) flexible substrates at different temperature and time. The results of the effect of selenization temperature and time on the morphology, structural, and optical property of the CZTSe films are presented in this work. It was found that the morphology of the CZTSe thin films depend on their elemental composition and time of selenization. Experimental data indicate that composition of the CZTSe films selenized within 10 and 20 min at 580 degrees C have the CZTSe basic phase and secondary phases (CuSe, SnSe and ZnSe). In contrast, the increase in selenization temperature and/or time leads to disappearing of the secondary phases (CuSe, SnSe) and better crystallization of the CZTSe films. It was found that films selenized at 560 and 580 degrees C within the same time have similar characteristics. Depending on selenization time and temperature of the CZTSe, thin films exhibited a shift in band gap from 1.16 to 1.19 and to 1.22 eV, respectively. The change of band gap of the CZTSe thin films is associated with changes of elemental and phase compositions, and thickness of the film. These results showed that the received CZTSe films on Ta foil can be used for fabrication of thin film solar cells."

However, the experimental results obtained so far do not reflect the expectations. Many factors are unable to explain it. In this work we have removed some of the approximations used for the efficiency evaluation taking into account the occupation of the bands, the inter-band absorption coefficients, and the optical thickness simultaneously. In many cases the results lower the expectations of the maximum efficiencies."
1065,I,"In order to solve the problems of power fluctuation in the photovoltaic (PV) grid-connected system and the nonlinearity in the model of inverters, a projection-based adaptive backstepping sliding mode controller with command-filter is designed in the system to adjust the DC-link voltage and the AC side current in the PV grid-connected system. Firstly, the mathematical model of the inverter in PV system is established, then backstepping control method is applied to control it, and the command filter is added to the controller to eliminate the differential expansion of the backstepping controller. Furthermore, the adaptive law based on Lyapunov stability theory is designed to estimate the uncertain parameters in the grid-connected inverter. A projection algorithm is introduced into the adaptive controller due to the demand of guaranteeing the bounded estimated value. Additionally, a sliding mode controller is increased to improve its robustness in this system. Considering the influence of irradiation and temperature changes, a battery energy storage system (BESS) is applied on the DC side to suppress the fluctuation of the output power of the PV system. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the presented strategy can control precisely the grid-connected inverter."
1066,I,"The exploration of nonprecious metal-based electrocatalysts with high efficiency for the triiodide reduction is critical for the practical applications of the dye-sensitized solar cells. Herein, we develop a facile one-step hydrothermal method to synthesize hollow hierarchical structure Co0.85Se. Under the methanol-water reaction system, the product named as hollow hierarchical structure Co0.85Se-M has the largest specific surface area (215.36 m(2) g(-1)) and the best crystallinity than other products obtained from other alcohol-water reaction systems. When this electrocatalyst is applied as a counter electrode for the dye-sensitized solar cells, it exhibits a small peak-to-peak separation (E-pp, 97 mV) for the reduction of I-3(-)/I- redox couple. It is found that the catalytic activity of Co0.85Se is closely dependent on the crystallinity. Moreover, the reactivity pathway is identified by density functional theory, which confirms that triiodide is reduced to iodide ion on Co0.85Se with a smaller energy barrier (similar to 0.65 eV) than on Pt (similar to 1.18 eV). Both experimental and theoretical results demonstrate Co0.85Se-M as an ideal counter electrode material for the dye-sensitized solar cells with a higher power conversion efficiency (8.76%) than Pt counter electrode (7.20%)."
1067,I,"Within the EURAMET ENG55 """"PhotoClass"""" project, several characteristics of photovoltaic (PV) devices beyond their performance at Standard Test Conditions were investigated, including measurements at varying irradiance and temperature. Four groups of PV devices of different size and technology were prepared and corresponding round-robins were run between partner laboratories with substantially different facilities and methods - namely based on spectral or integral measurements. This paper presents the outcome of the four inter-laboratory comparisons dealing with temperature coefficient measurements of the short-circuit current of PV devices, from reference-cell size to full-size commercial modules of mainly several c-Si technologies, but also with some examples of CIGS and GaAs devices. The measurement results are compared via E-n number assessment, hence including measurement uncertainties. The main outcome of this measurement exercise is a very good agreement of all the laboratories although completely different approaches were applied. In some cases, laboratory measurement uncertainties are even considered rather conservative and could therefore be revised. Furthermore, a comparison between bare cells and commercial modules of the same technology is made, which may represent useful information for PV manufacturers."
1068,I,"Health monitoring and diagnosis of photovoltaic (PV) systems is becoming crucial to maximise the power production, increase the reliability and life service of PV power plants. Operating under faulty conditions, in particular under shading, PV plants have remarkable shape of current-voltage (I-V) characteristics in comparison to reference condition (healthy operation). Based on real electrical measurements (I-V), the present work aims to provide a very simple, robust and low cost Fault Detection and Classification (FDC) method for PV shading faults. At first, we extract the features for different experimental tests under healthy and shading conditions to build the database. The features are then analysed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The accuracy of the data classification into the PCA space is evaluated using the confusion matrix as a metric of class separability. The results using experimental data of a 250 Wp PV module are very promising with a successful classification rate higher than 97% with four different configurations. The method is also cost effective as it uses only electrical measurements that are already available. No additional sensors are required."
1069,I,"All-sky imager based systems can be used to measure a number of cloud properties. Configurations consisting of two all-sky imagers can be used to derive cloud heights for weather stations, aviation and nowcasting of solar irradiance. One key question for such systems is the optimal distance between the all-sky imagers. This problem has not been studied conclusively in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, no previous in-field study of the optimal camera distance was performed. Also, comprehensive modeling is lacking. Here, we address this question with an in-field study on 93 days using 7 camera distances between 494 m and 2562 m and one specific cloud height estimation approach. We model the findings and draw conclusions for various configurations with different algorithmic methods and camera hardware. The camera distance is found to have a major impact on the accuracy of cloud height determinations. For the used 3 megapixel cameras, cloud heights up to 12,000 m and the used algorithmic approaches, an optimal camera distance of approximately 1500 m is determined. Optimal camera distances can be reduced to less than 1000 m if higher camera resolutions (e.g. 6 megapixel) are deployed. A step-by-step guide to determine the optimal camera distance is provided."
1070,I,"The potential of miniature dielectric crossed compound parabolic concentrator (dCCPC) panel as skylights for daylighting control has drawn a considerable research attention in the recent years, owing to its feature of variable transmittance according to the sun position, but the viability of using it as skylights in buildings has not been explored yet comprehensively. This paper aims to study the feasibility of utilizing miniature dCCPC panel as skylight in different locations under various climates in terms of energy saving potential besides its daylighting control function. The transmittance of dCCPC panel varies at every moment according to the sky condition and sun position. Due to this specific property, this study novelly implemented a polynomial formula of the dCCPC transmittance in the Grasshopper platform, from which EnergyPlus weather data can be called to calculate the hourly transmittance data of dCCPC skylight panel throughout the whole year. An hourly schedule of transmittance is generated according to the hourly sky condition determined by the daylight simulation through Radiance and Daysim, and is then input to EnergyPlus simulation to predict the energy consumption of a building with dCCPC skylight. Fourteen locations around the world are therefore compared to find the most appropriate place for using miniature dCCPC panel as skylights. The energy saving in cooling, heating and lighting with use of dCCPC skylight panel are investigated and compared with low-E and normal double glazing. The results show that the dCCPC skylight panel can reduce cooling load by mitigating solar heat gain effectively although its performance is affected by several criteria such as sky conditions and local climates. It is generally more suitable for the locations with longer hot seasons, e.g., Log Angeles, Miami, Bangkok and Manila, in which dCCPC could provide up to 13% reduction in annual energy consumption of building. For the locations having temperate and continental climates like Beijing, Rome, Istanbul and Hong Kong, a small annual energy saving from 1% to 5% could be obtained by using dCCPC skylight panel."
1071,I,"High resolution synthetic irradiance is of interest for theoretical studies such as grid integration of solar PV and battery storage analysis. Access to site-specific data is often limited to inadequate temporal resolutions for such application. A new model for producing synthetic solar global horizontal irradiance (GHI) time-series at up to 1-min resolution is presented as derived from >10-min input data. Briefly, it is a clustered-based method for daily clearness index distributions using Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture model (DPGMM). DPGMM is a non-parametric Bayesian (NPB) model indexed with an infinite-dimensional space of parameters. The key benefit of the NPB paradigm is the automatic adaptation to the correct complexity level and model size, suggesting a local adaptation of the model to all climatic conditions. A posterior inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm (namely Gibbs sampling) is applied. The model only requires a valid number of intraday data to construct daily distributions, then it can be applied worldwide. The synthetic GHI time series are validated against observed 1-min GHI data for four locations distributed throughout the world with different climatic conditions and significant geographic separation. Moreover, the presented method can generate data based on similar climatic conditions. A good fit between real and generated data is observed. We present an nRMSE <= 4% and nMBE < +/- 4% between generated and measured means at both daily and monthly scales for all sites. The agreement between the real and generated cumulative density distributions of six comparative variability metrics (defined in text) at four different sites is measured using the overlapping and the Kullback-Leibler coefficients, which are >= 75% and <= 10% respectively, in all cases. To ensure the reproducibility of the research presented in this paper, the methodology is freely available as an R-package downloadable from SolarClusGnr."
1072,I,"Higher air temperatures in large cities like Manchester, UK, reduce human thermal comfort. In this paper, the impact of land cover on microclimate, and consequently on indoor thermal comfort is studied. Through different stages, field measurements and computer modelling were carried out for a heat wave episode in summer 2017 in Manchester: First, the urban heat island (UHI) was measured between the city centre of Manchester and the campus of the University of Salford (between May to October 2017). Maximum detected UHI was 2.3 degrees C at 4:00, during the hottest day of the year. Parallel measurements within the university campus showed that the park was 0.9 degrees C cooler than the paved areas (maximum cooling effect was 3.6 degrees C at 14:45). Finally, the impact of the current land cover of the campus, and a greener land cover (as a renaturing scenario) with more planted trees on indoor thermal comfort of a house within the campus were studied. It was found that by adding 17% more trees to the campus, indoor thermal comfort was improved by 20.8% during the hottest day of 2017 in Manchester. These showed that renaturing cities could be a solution for future warmer climates."
1073,I,"This work presents the results of the first interlaboratory comparison of linearity measurements of short-circuit current versus irradiance that includes a wide variety of photovoltaic (PV) device types, from reference cells to full-size modules. The aim of this inter-comparison was to compare the methods employed and to collect new inputs useful for the revision of the standard IEC 60904-10, which deals with linearity measurements for PV devices. The procedures and facilities employed by the partners include the differential spectral responsivity, the white light response, the solar simulator method and the two-lamp method. The facilities are generically described and compared and their main sources of uncertainty are discussed. Comparison results show good agreement within declared uncertainties between all partners. A few minor exceptions under low-light conditions raise questions of possible uncertainty underestimation for these specific conditions. The overall outcome of the comparison also highlights the importance of considering correlations in the uncertainty budget, which can potentially improve the overall stated uncertainty. A critical review is made of the data analysis adopted in the standard IEC 60904-10 to calculate the linearity degree of the short-circuit current towards irradiance. The analysis review suggests a way to make results based on different methods more comparable and less prone to erroneous linearity assessment."
1074,I,"Three thermocline-control (TCC) methods are assessed through numerical simulations for a thermal-energy storage (TES) filled with a packed bed of rocks. Two previously suggested methods are based on extracting or injecting heat-transfer fluid (HTF) through ports, while the third is a novel method based on mixing HTF streams. The assessment was carried out using simulations with a model that resolves the packed bed in one dimension. Simulations of stand-alone TES with maximum allowed outflow temperature differences of 10% at quasi-steady conditions showed that the mixing method with three ports led to the largest utilization factors - the fraction of the maximum storage capacity that is actually utilized of - 90.8% and 85.1% for molten salt (MS) and compressed air (CA) as HTF, respectively. These represent relative improvements of 38.8% and 73.4% compared to the baseline configurations without TCC. The increased utilization factors come at the expense of small decreases in the cycle exergy efficiency. For the mixing method with three ports, the exergy efficiencies were 97.3% and 95.6% for MS and CA, respectively. Simulations of a TES with MS as HTF integrated into a CSP plant operating on a Rankine steam cycle showed that TCC increases the annually averaged plant efficiency and the annual net electricity generated solely from thermal energy supplied by the TES. These results suggest that the small decreases in the exergy efficiency of the TES are outweighed by the large increases in the utilization factor."
1075,I,"This analysis investigates the design, cost, and performance of the simple, recompression, and partial-cooling configurations of the supercritical carbon dioxide power cycle integrated with a molten salt power tower concentrating solar power system. This paper uses a steady-state model to design each cycle with varying amounts of recuperator conductance to understand performance and cost trade-offs. The recompression cycle can achieve a higher thermal efficiency than the partial-cooling cycle, and the partial-cooling cycle achieves a higher thermal efficiency than the simple cycle. The partial-cooling cycle is the most expensive cycle because it requires more total turbomachinery capacity. However, the partial-cooling cycle has the largest temperature range of heat input. This feature leads to cheaper two-tank thermal energy storage, higher receiver efficiencies, and lower mass flow rates in the power tower. Crucially, the lower mass flow rates significantly reduce pump electricity consumption relative to the recompression-cycle system. Consequently, this study finds that the power tower system integrated with the partial-cooling cycle is both cheaper and generates more net electricity than systems integrated with the other two cycles. Finally, this paper presents a parametric study on the air-cooler approach temperature and shows that small approach temperatures can improve cycle efficiency and increase the temperature range of heat input, which can lead to smaller optimal approach temperatures than may be expected."
1076,I,"The demand for accurate solar irradiance nowcast increases together with the rapidly growing share of solar energy within our electricity grids. Intra-hour variabilities, mainly caused by clouds, have a significant impact on solar power plant dispatch and thus on electricity grids. All sky imager (ASI) based nowcasting systems, with a high temporal and spatial resolution, can provide irradiance nowcasts that can help to optimize CSP plant operation, solar power plant dispatch and grid operation. The radiative effect of clouds is highly variable and depends on micro- and macrophysical cloud properties. Frequently, nowcasting systems have to measure/estimate the radiative effect during complex multi-layer conditions with strong variations of the optical properties between individual clouds. We present a novel approach determining cloud transmittance from measurements or from correlations of transmittance with cloud height information. The cloud transmittance is measured by a pyrheliometer when shaded, as the ratio of shaded direct normal irradiance (DNI) and clear sky DNI. However, for most clouds, direct transmittance measurements are not available, as these clouds are not shading the used pyrheliometers. These clouds receive an estimated transmittance value based on (1) their height, (2) results of a probability analysis with historical cloud height and transmittance measurements as well as (3) recent transmittance measurements and their corresponding cloud height. Cloud heights are measured by a stereoscopic approach utilizing two ASIs. We discuss site dependencies of the presented transmittance estimation method and the potential integration of automatic cloud classification approaches. We validated the cloud transmittance estimation over two years (2016 and 2017) and compare the probabilistic cloud transmittance estimation approach with four simple approaches. The overall mean-absolute deviation (MAD) and root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) are 0.11 and 0.16 respectively for transmittance. The deviations are significantly lower for optically thick or thin clouds and larger for clouds with moderate transmittance between 0.18 and 0.585. Furthermore we validated the overall DNI forecast quality of the entire nowcasting system, using this transmittance estimation method, over the same data set with three spatially distributed pyrheliometers. Overall deviations of 13% and 21% are reached for the relative MAD and RMSD with a lead time of 10 min. The effects of the chosen data set on the validation results are demonstrated by means of the skill score."
1077,I,"Very thin, thermally evaporated MoOx (x < 3) layer has been used as transparent hole-selective contact on an n-type Germanium substrate to effectively demonstrate PV conversion capability. The fabricated MoOx/Ge heterojunction PV cell shows a photocurrent density of 44.8 mA/cm(2) under AM1.5G illumination, which is comparable to that of conventional Ge PV cells. However, a low open-circuit voltage of 138 mV is obtained, which might be explained by the presence of tunnelling mechanisms through the MoOx/Ge interface. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a hole-selective contact made of transition metal oxide on an n-type semiconductor different from c-Si. Thus, this work may have important implications toward the development of new device architectures, such as novel low-cost Ge PV cells with possible applications in multijunction solar cells and thermophotovoltaics."
1078,I,"The urgent need to decarbonise energy supplies has prompted exponential growth of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems across the world. As the penetration of renewable energy sources increases, the need to accurately forecast electricity output heightens to ensure efficient energy system operation. While exposure to high temperatures and moisture are known to significantly reduce PV panel efficiency, the effects of wind on both PV panel temperature and electricity output are poorly resolved. Here, meteorological and PV panel production data from Westmill Solar Park, Oxfordshire, were examined to determine the influence of wind, cloud, ambient temperature and relative humidity. We found that, after solar radiation, relative humidity and cloud cover were the dominant controls of PV electricity output; increases in relative humidity and cloud cover were associated with decreased electricity outputs. However, when all other variables were held constant, the mean electricity generated under southerly winds was 20.4 - 42.9% greater than under northerly winds, with the difference greater at higher electricity outputs and attributable to differences in surface cooling capabilities caused by the PV array asymmetry. This finding suggests that PV electricity output predictions could be improved by incorporating wind direction into computer models. Moreover, there is potential to modify solar park design and deployment location to capitalise on wind benefits, especially in areas where panel temperatures are a leading cause of efficiency loss. Ensuring deployments are optimised for site environmental conditions could boost electricity outputs, and therefore profitability, with implications for system viability in post-subsidy markets."
1079,D,"The diets of contemporary hunter-gatherers are diverse and highly nutritious, but are rapidly changing as these societies integrate into the market economy. Here, we analyse empirical data on the dietary patterns and sources of foods of three contemporary hunter-gatherer societies: the Baka of Cameroon (n=160), the Tsimane' of Bolivia (n=124) and the Punan Tubu of Indonesia (n=109). We focus on differences among villages with different levels of integration into the market economy and explore potential pathways through which two key elements of the food environment (food availability and food accessibility) might alter the diets of contemporary hunter-gatherers. Results suggest that people living in isolated villages have more diverse diets than those living in villages closer to markets. Our results also suggest that availability of nutritionally important foods (i.e., fruits, vegetables and animal foods) decreases with increasing market integration, while availability of fats and sweets increases. The differences found seem to relate to changes in the wider food environment (e.g., village level access to wild and/or market foods and seasonality), rather than to individual-level factors (e.g., time allocation or individual income), probably because food sharing reduces the impact of individual level differences in food consumption. These results highlight the need to better understand the impact of changes in the wider food environment on dietary choice, and the role of the food environment in driving dietary transitions."
1080,I,"The application of greenhouse technologies is rapidly expanding in China and other regions of the world with the continental climate. Such technologies are characterized by a considerable consumption of fossil fuels, especially in winter periods. Various renewable energy technologies are used to reduce the energy demand in greenhouses, including solar heating. Simpler designs of water or air solar collectors are preferred without sun-tracking devices and reduced dimensions and weight. In this work, a novel solar multi-surface air collector with double-receiver tubes, which does not require a sun-tracking device is proposed and has increased concentration ratio and sun rays convergence and reduced thermal losses. The laboratory and full-scale prototypes of the proposed novel collector were manufactured and tested in laboratory conditions during the December-January period as a part of the greenhouse with the active-passive ventilation wall and latent thermal storage, located in the Beijing Region. Results of experiments demonstrate that the solar collector increases the average temperatures of the greenhouse north wall inner surface by 7.5 degrees C, indoor air during the night-time by 1.8 degrees C and indoor soil by 1.5 degrees C. The novel collector provided active heat gains of 11.831 GJ during the December-January period and satisfied from 11% to 81% of the heat load. A lumped parameter mathematical model of the proposed collector was developed, and the comparison of simulation results and experimental data demonstrate its high accuracy in prediction of the collector performance. The model was used to study the influences of outdoor meteorological parameters, air velocity in the receiver tubes and their length on the performance of the collector. This data was used to determine the rational design parameters and air velocity of the full-scale collector. The model was also used to rationalize the variation of air velocity in the receiver tube during the day."
1081,I,"Hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) solar cells have some performance limitations related to the mobility and lifetime of their carriers. For this reason, it is interesting to explore thin-film solutions, achieving a tradeoff between photons optical absorption and the electrical path of the carriers to get the optimum thickness. In this work, we propose the insertion of a metasurface based on a cross-patterned ITO contact film, where the crosses are filled with nanospheres. We numerically demonstrate that this configuration improves the photogenerated current up to a 40% by means of the resonant effects produced by the metasurface, being independent on the impinging light polarization. Light handling mechanisms guide light into the active and auxiliary layers, increasing the effective absorption and mitigating the Staebler-Wronski effect. The selection of optimum materials and parameters results in nanospheres of ZnO with a 220 nm radius."
1082,I,"Conversion of sunlight into electricity is the fastest growing commercial means of deploying renewable energy at utility scale. The two primary methods for conversion are photovoltaics and concentrating solar thermal power. The complimentary advantages of these two methods motivates interest in hybridizing the two. Here, a spectral beam splitting approach is designed and tested for application as a retrofit in existing parabolic trough concentrating solar power facilities, the first large scale test using such an approach with low-cost silicon photovoltaic cells. Such an approach leverages the existing capital cost of the plant with the potential to boost plant output. The novel on-sun testing here focused on the electrical performance of a silicon photovoltaic module integrated into the most common parabolic trough geometry with a net aperture area of 1.7 m(2). The spectral beam splitter has a solar weighted reflectance of 71.2%, and delivered an average flux to the cells of 17,828 W/m(2) representing a concentration ratio of 25x, within 10% of the prediction of the optical ray tracing model. The two photovoltaic modules achieved an average efficiency - based upon measured irradiance delivered to the cells - of 12.4% (or 3% if normalized to the total aperture of the area of the mirror). A corresponding decrease in thermal performance was observed when the retrofit was added. Overall the design is capable of providing a path to retrofit existing parabolic trough powerplants to provide a 13% increase in power output using commercially available photovoltaic technology."
1083,I,"Anisotropic mechanical strain as low as 0.1% modifies the electronic response of crystalline semiconductor-based devices and in particular affects the performance of solar cells. We measure the dark current-voltage characteristic of silicon heterojunction solar cells under different levels of tensile uniaxial stress and observe a reversible change of the j-V curve with applied strain. Using a two-exponential description of the j-V characteristic to fit our experimental data, we obtain the strain dependence of the diffusion saturation current and find a decrease of about 3% for a tensile strain level of 6.7 x 10(-4). We compare these experiments to a theoretical model that accounts for the effect of strain on the band energy levels, densities of states and mobilities of carriers. The theoretical estimation of the change in saturation current is found to be in reasonable agreement with experimental results."
1084,I,"Photovoltaic technology penetration is experiencing noticeable progress. However, its performance is significantly affected by soiling, which is influenced by several factors such as site characteristics, weather, tilt angle and surface orientation, surface material and dust properties. This indoor study investigates the effect of soiling on photovoltaic modules, focusing on dust properties and PV surface materials as influencing factors. A Solar simulator, spectrometer and SEM/EDX were used to characterise and investigate the effect of accumulation of 13 different samples (ash, bird droppings, carpet dust, cement, charcoal, clay, coarse sand, laterite, loam soil, salt, sandy soil, stone dust and wood dust) on PV performance. The findings develop upon previous studies on the effects of dust particle accumulation on PV performance by using more dust samples and applying more rigorous techniques. The results show that charcoal appears to have the worst degradation effect on PV performance with about 98% reduction in short circuit current while salt seems to have the least impact with about 7%. The influence of 2 PV surface materials (acrylic plastic and low iron glass) on dust accumulation were examined, and results show that the acrylic plastic accumulates more dust when compared to low iron glass. Results also show that dry deposition has a reduced adhesion to the coupons compared to wet deposition. The findings could be used in selecting PV farm sites by avoiding areas with high pollution, and it could stimulate further research on selecting an appropriate mitigation technique. The ramifications caused because of soiling cannot be overlooked or overemphasis; as such there is a need to identify appropriate and cost-effective mitigation techniques that can continue to promote the global penetration of PV technologies and sustain its performance."
1085,I,"We present an analysis of the accuracy and cost of energy rating of photovoltaic modules. We identify the prominent sources of uncertainty and demonstrate that good estimates of energy rating can be made with a reduced set of measurements, thereby reducing cost. The energy rating standards IEC 61853 parts 1-4 provide a method for differentiating the expected performance of photovoltaic modules under real-world conditions. It combines a comprehensive set of measurements on modules with a numerical model to produce performance ratings for different reference climates. We have developed a simulation tool to explore the sensitivity of energy rating to various factors, including an uncertainty model developed from a survey of accredited test and calibration laboratories. The set of 22 performance-matrix measurements required by the standard do not span the full range of conditions experienced in the reference climates. Nevertheless, we find that extrapolation and interpolation of the measurements is sufficiently accurate for different module types. Indeed, the number of measurements can be significantly reduced without adversely affecting accuracy. We find that the overall accuracy of energy rating is similar to that of power output at standard test conditions. A sensitivity analysis identified the most important sources of uncertainty to be the measurement of irradiance and the nominal module operating temperature."
1086,I,"A systematic study of the application of self-assembly monolayers (SAMs) onto electron and hole transporting layers for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) stability is reported. Cs(0.)(05)FA(0.83)MA(0.17)Pb(I0.87Br0.13)(3) (FMC) perovskite films were deposited onto tin oxide (SnO2) and nickel oxide (NiOx) layers that were functionalized with ethylphosphonic acid (EPA) and 4-bromobenzoic acid (BBA) SAMs. X-ray diffractometry measurements were performed on these films shortly after they were deposited. The diffractograms agree with the positions reported in the literature for the crystal structure of the FMC. The results show that the deposition of SAMs on the metal oxide layers yields positive improvements in the FMC film stability and in the device stability when using FMC as the active layer. The work shows that by adopting SAMs, the long-term stability of PSCs cells under accelerated test conditions can be enhanced, and this provides one step on the way to making this technology a commercial reality."
1087,I,"Soiling represents a major problem for CSP plants, since the accumulation of particles onto the reflective surface cause absorption and scattering of solar irradiance, leading to a significant decrease in the mirrors' reflectance. Such problem can be amplified, particularly in CSP plants that are installed in semi-arid or arid regions which possess a high direct normal irradiance availability, prone to higher particle deposition due to sand storms, red rain events and, in general, higher atmospheric particle concentration. As means to reduce the amount of dust adhering to the mirrors, anti-soiling coatings are being developed to reduce particle deposition, minimizing maintenance costs due to cleaning processes, leading to an enhancement of energy production. In this paper, a Tracking Cleanliness Sensor was used to compare the Soiling Index between a set of coated and uncoated mirrors, which were left outdoors to naturally accumulate soiling in two different positions, horizontal and tilted 45. The anti-soiling coating was developed by a partnership between RIOGLASS and IK4-TEKNIKER. Moreover, a simple economical model is proposed here for different possible scenarios regarding the coating used."
1088,I,"This research focuses on the potential of greenhouse cultivation in circumpolar territories. It begins with a survey that encompasses most of the northern greenhouses in North America. This review emphasizes the need for appropriate data and for the right energy system design. Next, the paper focuses on a case study located in Nunavik, which is the northern Inuit territory of the province of Quebec. The Kuujjuaq cooperative greenhouse has been instrumented since June 2016 to collect data on temperature and relative humidity throughout the growing season. These measures have highlighted a major problem: a temperature difference between day and night that is too large, hindering crop development. To counteract this thermal behavior, a heat storage system was designed, built and installed in October 2018. It is the first time that a rock and air-based sensible thermal energy storage system, taking into account local materials and resources, has been designed and built in a northern greenhouse. This paper presents its main characteristics as well as records of temperature changes throughout the growing season. Moreover, an energy balance is presented for three days at the beginning of June 2019."
1089,I,"Covalent Functionalized-Multi wall carbon nanotubes (CF-MWCNTs) and Covalent Functionalized-graphene nanoplatelets (CF-GNPs) with hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) were suspended in distilled water to prepare the hybrid nanofluids as working fluids inside the Flat Plate Solar Collector (FPSC). Different concentrations of the hybrid nanoparticles were considered and Tween-80 (Tw-80) was used as a surfactant. The stability and thermophysical properties were tested using different measurement tools. The structural and morphological properties were examined using FTIR, XRD, UV-vis spectrometry, HRTEM, FESEM, and EDX. The thermal efficiency of FPSC were tested under different volumetric flow rates (2 L/min, 3 L/min, and 4 L/min), whereas the efficiency of the collector was determined based on ASHRAE standard 93-2010. As a result, the most thermal-efficient solar collector improved up to 85% with hybrid nanofluid as the absorption medium at 4 L/min flow rate. Increment in nanoparticles' concentrations enhanced thermal energy gain and resulted in higher fluid outlet temperature."
1090,I,"Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been made eligible for proficient power conversion efficiency (PCE) by optimizing the perovskite film's morphology, formation, interfaces, and charge collection for increased effectiveness. This paper applied a new method for Cu2O/methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3))/SiO2 structure with heterojunction PSCs. This paper developed a novel synthesis engineering method for thin Cu2O hole-transporting material layer (HTML) and ultrathin SiO2 electron-transporting material layer (ETML). Cu2O HTML and SiO2 ETML could improve the PCE and carrier charge for recombination and recollection. The architecture includes a reduced film thickness by hetero-contact synthesis engineering, which resulted in an impactful enhancement of open-circuit voltage (Voc). The stable Voc effect was induced by constructing the interfilm of Cu2O and SiO2 between the main CH3NH3PbI3 layers, which transported electrons/electron holes, resulting in an excellent PCE of 18.4%. The fabrication showed that inorganic materials can be applied for the potential interfacial engineering of perovskite-based solar cells."
1091,I,Rapid plasma-induced non-equilibrium electrochemistry (PiNE) at atmospheric pressure was used to prepare surfactant-free gold nanoparticles and copper oxide quantum dots. A suite of chemical and physical characterisation is carried out to assess the as-prepared materials. Nanofluids comprised of these nanoparticles in ethylene glycol have been prepared. The energy absorptive properties of the prepared nanofluids were investigated as a potential additive to the traditional working fluids used in solar thermal collectors. The application feasibility has been assessed by calculating a value of power which could be transferred to the thermal fluid. This work demonstrates an alternative and rapid method to produce nanofluids for solar thermal conversion.
1092,I,"Novel thermal insulation materials and wall configurations have the potential to play a major role in reducing energy demand and carbon emissions from the building sector. In this study, a passive heating wall system composed by a CO2-filled transparent thermal insulation (TTI) and an organic phase change material (PCM), and a passive cooling system composed by a Tromble Wall with nano-film and a CO2-filled TTI are proposed and evaluated. The aim is to present a detailed analytical model for rapidly calculating thermal performance of the proposed wall configurations. As case study, a 108 m(2) south facade of a building located in Mexico has been used. Outputs suggest that as a passive heating measure, the system has the potential to supply heat in the order of 118 W, 126 W, 134 W, and 157 W, during the months of December, January, February, and March respectively. Additionally, thermal performance and air velocity simulations suggest that for the heating case, considering an outdoor and indoor temperature conditions of 0 degrees C and 21 degrees C respectively, the internal layer surface reaches a temperature of 9.2 degrees C; while for the cooling case, considering outdoor and indoor temperature conditions of 25 degrees C and 21 degrees C respectively, it reaches 22.5 degrees C with a maximum indoor air velocity of 0.5 m/s. Compared to other gases, CO2 could hold a greater potential due to its low thermal conductivity and capital costs. Large-scale implementation of such systems could make the building sector an interesting option as an artificial sink for carbon storage."
1093,I,"Mono- and di-anchoring gamma-pyranylidene-based organic dyes featuring D-pi-A and D-(pi-A)(2) architectures have been engineered as sensitizers for applications in Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs). Their photophysical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties were further investigated. TD-DFT calculations were performed to rationalize the trends observed in the optical and electrochemical properties of the dyes. The investigation of the photovoltaic performances of this series of new dyes provided structure-property relationships where their Power Conversion Efficiencies (PCE) could be correlated to structural features, such as the length of the pi-conjugated spacer, the nature of the substituents on the pyranylidene electron donor moiety and the number of anchoring groups. Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells based on mono-anchoring dyes were more efficient than the corresponding cells based on di-anchoring analogues due to high dye loading. The highest Power Conversion Efficiency of 5.23% was achieved with the mono-anchoring 17a dye containing t-butyl substituent groups on the pyranylidene fragment and with one thienyl pi-conjugated spacer."
1094,I,"Thermal activation of new oxidant chemicals like Persulfate (PS) has recently gained attention in driving advanced oxidation processes (AOP) for a number of applications. On the other hand, addressing energy demand with carbon free and sustainable energy solutions represents an asset for new technologies in the modern society. This paper then investigates on the removal of pharmaceuticals residues in wastewater (WW), conducted with PS advanced oxidation reactions on a solar thermal pilot equipment. Indoor preliminary investigations on small scale laboratory experimentations show how increasing temperature has a direct positive impact on pollutants degradations rate (k(app) value ranging from 0.4.10(-3) s(-1) at ambient to 10.4.10(-3) s at 75 degrees C). However, after an experimental screening methodology, 65 degrees C and 200 mu M appear as the appropriate target temperature and PS oxidant dosage to cope with both activation of PS oxidant and degradation of ten target micropollutants typically found in WW stream. Outdoor experimentations on the solar pilot equipment were conducted according to a batch running mode at a treatment capacity scale of a cubic meter. 95% pollutant removal rate is achieved within 2 h once the temperature has raised up to the target value (65 degrees C) in the bulk treated WW effluent. Series of treatment cycles under the natural day/night period demonstrate the reproducibility of the performance. As an early step result of the process optimization approach, heat recovery demonstration on the pilot equipment improves significantly the energetic balance over the now innovative thermal solar water treatment."
1095,I,"Combined cycle concentrating solar power (CSP) plants provide significant potential to achieve an efficiency increase and an electricity cost reduction compared to current single-cycle plants. A combined cycle CSP system requires a receiver technology capable of effectively transferring heat from concentrated solar irradiation to a pressurized air stream in a gas turbine. The novel spiky central receiver air pre-heater (SCRAP) technology is proposed to overcome barriers experienced to date. The SCRAP receiver is a novel metallic receiver technology aimed at pre-heating an air stream to about 800 degrees C, either prior to a combustion chamber or alternatively prior to a cascaded secondary non-metallic receiver system, capable of achieving elevated temperatures. A ray-tracing analysis demonstrated that the flux imposed on the absorber assemblies is dependent on the heliostat size. A thermodynamic computer model was developed to investigate the performance characteristics of the absorber assemblies (spikes) of the SCRAP receiver. The model was validated against an experimental test setup. Satisfactory agreement at various air flow rates was obtained. The thermal efficiency of the spikes was investigated and used to approximate the receiver's solarthermal efficiency. The receiver is predicted to perform at solar- thermal efficiencies exceeding 80%. The geometric design of the receiver achieves a relatively low radiative heat loss, predicted at about 4-5%. A relatively large vulnerability to convective heat losses was identified. The pressure loss was found to be relatively low, compared to existing alternative receiver designs, with system pressure losses below 40 mbar achievable."
1096,J,We demonstrate that an extended scaffold based on a self-immolative linker (SIL) enables the universal production of O-aryl glucuronide prodrugs: high yield glucuronidation is performed on a precursor substrate (SIL) and the subsequent drug conjugation proceeds via less challenging chemical reactions.
1097,J,"The stereoselective construction of 1,2-cis-glycosidic linkages is key in the assembly of biologically relevant glycans, but remains a synthetic challenge. Reagent-controlled glycosylation methodologies, in which external nucleophiles are employed to modulate the reactivity of the glycosylation system, have become powerful means for the construction of 1,2-cis-glycosidic linkages. Here we establish that nucleophilic additives can support the construction of alpha-1,2-glucans, and apply our findings in the construction of a d-alanine kojibiose functionalized glycerol phosphate teichoic acid fragment. This latter molecule can be found in the cell wall of the opportunistic Gram-positive bacterium, Enterococcus faecalis and represents a structural element that can possibly be used in the development of therapeutic vaccines and diagnostic tools."
1098,J,"An inverse electron demand Diels-Alder reaction between tetrazine and trans-cyclooctene (TCO) holds great promise for protein modification and manipulation. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a tetrazine-based disulfide rebridging reagent, which allows the site-selective installation of a tetrazine group into disulfide-containing peptides and proteins such as the hormone somatostatin (SST) and the antigen binding fragment (Fab) of human immunoglobulin G (IgG). The fast and efficient conjugation of the tetrazine modified proteins with three different TCO-containing substrates to form a set of bioconjugates in a site-selective manner was successfully demonstrated for the first time. Homogeneous, well-defined bioconjugates were obtained underlining the great potential of our method for fast bioconjugation in emerging protein therapeutics. The formed bioconjugates were stable against glutathione and in serum, and they maintained their secondary structure. With this work, we broaden the scope of tetrazine chemistry for site-selective protein modification to prepare well-defined SST and Fab conjugates with preserved structures and good stability under biologically relevant conditions."
1099,J,"The stereoselective introduction of the glycosidic bond is one of the main challenges in chemical oligosaccharide synthesis. Stereoselective glycosylation can be achieved using neighbouring group participation of a C-2 auxiliary or using additives, for example. Both methods aim to generate a defined reactive intermediate that reacts in a stereoselective manner with alcohol nucleophiles. This inspired us to develop new C-2 auxiliaries based on commonly used additive functionalities such as ethers, phosphine oxides and tertiary amides. Good 1,2-trans-selectivity was observed for the phosphine oxide and amide-based auxiliaries expanding the toolbox with new auxiliaries for stereoselective glycosylation reactions."
1100,J,"The oxidative activation of the perfluorinated analogue of dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO-F-6, by hydroxyl radicals efficiently produces trifluoromethyl radicals based on pulse radiolysis, laboratory scale experiments, and comparison of rates of reaction for analogous radical systems. In comparison to commercially available precursors, DMSO-F-6 proved to be more stable, easier to handle and overall more convenient than leading F3C-reagents and may therefore be an ideal surrogate to study F3C radicals for time-resolved kinetics studies. In addition, we present an improved protocol for the preparation of this largely unexplored reagent."
1101,J,"The cascade reaction between N-tosylhydrazones and 2-alkynylpyridines leads to 2-(pyrazol-3-yl)pyridines, important structural motifs in ligands for transition metals and bioactive molecules. When the reaction is conducted with 2,6-diethynylpyridine, the important 2,6-bis(pyrazolyl)pyridines are obtained, featuring the arrangement of tridentate and also pentadentate ligands. A novel three-component version of the reaction has been designed, which involves the use of alpha-bromo-N-tosylhydrazones, alkynylpyridines and NH-azoles. The generality of the multicomponent reaction is further illustrated by the preparation of different polysubstituted pyrazoles by employing an array of terminal alkynes. In these multicomponent reactions, complex molecules featuring three different heterocycles are assembled in a single step from commercial materials, enabling the fast generation of molecular diversity."
1102,J,"A novel approach for the formation of bisindolylmethane derivatives (BIMs) is described as a proof of concept to evaluate the catalytic capacity of iodoalkynes. The use of these derivatives is reported as an example of simple halogen bond-based organocatalyst. This kind of activation has not been used before for the synthesis of bisindolylmethane derivatives 3. Interestingly, the preparation of 3-(1H-indol-3-yl)-1-phenylbutan-1-one (8) has been also achieved for the first time with an iodoalkyne derivative. We prove the efficiency of this family of new catalysts by developing a simple and easy operational methodology, opening the door to the development of alternative catalysts in the area of halogen bond-based organocatalysts."
1103,J,"In order to improve epoxides conversion to carbonates by fixation of CO2 a new type of perfluorinated triol catalysts was developed. These simple acyclic scaffolds of enhanced acidity are efficient for catalysis through selective H-bonding activation of the epoxide. In combination with TBAI as co-catalyst, this useful transformation is performed under only 1 atmosphere of CO2 and between 30 to 80 degrees C. Both the 1,3,5-triol motif and the perfluorinated side chains are crucial in order to observe this epoxide opening under such mild conditions. In addition, the stereochemistry of the starting epoxide can efficiently be conserved during the carbonate formation."
1104,J,"Diazocines are characterized by extraordinary photochemical properties rendering them of particular interest for switching the conformation of biomolecules with visible light. Current developments afford synthetic access to unprecedented diazocine derivatives promising particular opportunities in photocontrol of proteins and biological systems. In this work, the well-established approach of photocontrolling the secondary structure of alpha-helices was exploited using a diazocine to reversibly fold and unfold the tertiary structure of a small protein. The protein of choice was the globulary folded Trp-cage, a widely used model system for the elucidation of protein folding pathways. A specifically designed, short and rigid dicarboxy-functionalized diazocine-based cross-linker was attached to two solvent-exposed side chains at the alpha-helix of the miniprotein through the use of a primary amine-selective active ester. This cross-linking strategy is orthogonal to the common cysteine-based chemistry. The cross-linked Trp-cage was successfully photoisomerized and exhibited a strong correlation between protein fold and diazocine isomeric state. As determined by NMR spectroscopy, the cis-isomer stabilized the fold, while the trans-isomer led to complete protein unfolding. The successful switching of the protein fold in principle demonstrates the ability to control protein function, as the activity depends on their structural integrity."
1105,J,"S-Glycosides are important tools for the elucidation of specific protein-carbohydrate interactions and can significantly aid structural and functional studies of carbohydrate-active enzymes, as they are often inert or act as enzyme inhibitors. In this context, this work focuses on the introduction of an S-linkage into arabinoxylan oligosaccharides (AXs) in order to obtain a small collection of synthetic tools for the study of AXs degrading enzymes. The key step for the introduction of the S-glycosidic linkage involved anomeric thiol S-alkylation of an orthogonally protected l-arabinopyranoside triflate. The resulting S-linked disaccharide was subsequently employed in a series of glycosylation reactions to obtain a selectively protected tetrasaccharide. This could be further elaborated through chemoselective deprotection and glycosylation reactions to introduce branching l-arabinofuranosides."
1106,J,"The synthesis of the fully protected peptide, polyketide and alkaloid fragments of anachelin H is presented. The peptide fragment was prepared using a liquid phase peptide synthesis; the polyketide fragment was synthetized using a cross metathesis and an intramolecular oxa-Michael reaction as the key steps to introduce the desired stereochemistry; finally, the alkaloid fragment was obtained by an oxidative cyclization of a catechol derivative using potassium ferricyanide. The synthesis of all fragments was based on the use of natural amino acids as sources of asymmetry. The independent synthesis of the three fragments should allow more efficient biological studies on the fragments instead of the whole natural product. Experiments to illustrate the coupling of fragments and the effectiveness of the convergent strategy are also described."
1107,J,"A unique feature of kinetically inert covalent base-pairing is that the nature of the chemical information that is transferred can be modulated by changing the chemical connectivity between the two bases. Formation of esters between phenols and benzoic acids has been used as a base-pairing strategy for sequence information transfer in template-directed synthesis of linear oligomers, but the copy strand produced by this process has the complementary sequence to the template strand. It is possible to form a base-pair between two benzoic acids by using a hydroquinone linker, which is eliminated when the product duplex is hydrolysed. Using this approach, covalent template-directed synthesis was carried out using a benzoic acid 3-mer template to produce an identical copy. This direct replication process was used in iterative rounds of replication leading to an increase of the population of the copied oligomer."
1108,J,"1,4- and 1,5-Disubstituted triazole amino acid monomers have gained increasing interest among peptidic foldamers, as they are easily prepared via Cu- and Ru-catalyzed click reactions, with the potential for side chain variation. While the latter is key to their applicability, the synthesis and structural properties of the chiral mono- or disubstituted triazole amino acids have only been partially addressed. We here present the synthesis of all eight possible chiral derivatives of a triazole monomer prepared via a ruthenium-catalyzed azide alkyne cycloaddition (RuAAC). To evaluate the conformational properties of the individual building units, a systematic quantum chemical study was performed on all monomers, indicating their capacity to form several low energy conformers. This feature may be used to effect structural diversity when the monomers are inserted into various peptide sequences. We envisage that these results will facilitate new applications for these artificial oligomeric compounds in diverse areas, ranging from pharmaceutics to biotechnology."
1109,J,"A majority of cocaine users also consume alcohol. The concurrent use of cocaine and alcohol produces the pharmacologically active metabolites cocaethylene and norcocaethylene, in addition to norcocaine. Both cocaethylene and norcocaethylene are more toxic than cocaine itself. Hence, a truly valuable cocaine-metabolizing enzyme for cocaine abuse/overdose treatment should be effective for the hydrolysis of not only cocaine, but also its metabolites norcocaine, cocaethylene, and norcocaethylene. However, there has been no report on enzymes capable of hydrolyzing norcocaethylene (the most toxic metabolite of cocaine). The catalytic efficiency parameters (k(cat) and K-M) of human butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and two mutants (known as cocaine hydrolases E14-3 and E12-7) against norcocaethylene have been characterized in the present study for the first time, and they are compared with those against cocaine. According to the obtained kinetic data, wild-type human BChE showed a similar catalytic efficiency against norcocaethylene (k(cat) = 9.5 min(-1), K-M = 11.7 mu M, and k(cat)/K-M = 8.12 x 10(5) M-1 min(-1)) to that against (-)-cocaine (k(cat) = 4.1 min(-1), K-M = 4.5 mu M, and k(cat)/K-M = 9.1 x 10(5) M-1 min(-1)). E14-3 and E12-7 showed an improved catalytic activity against norcocaethylene compared to wild-type BChE. E12-7 showed a 39-fold improved catalytic efficiency against norcocaethylene (k(cat) = 210 min(-1), K-M = 6.6 mu M, and k(cat)/K-M = 3.18 x 10(7) M-1 min(-1)). It has been demonstrated that E12-7 as an exogenous enzyme can efficiently metabolize norcocaethylene in rats."
1110,J,"P-Rhodamines were accessed by implementing a robust three step sequence consisting of (i) addition of m-metallated anilines to dichlorophosphine oxides, (ii) selective dibromination, and (iii) cyclization of the diaryllithium reagents derived from the dibromides to form the dihydroacridophosphine core of P-rhodamines. A modified route was developed to produce non-symmetric P-rhodamines. A library of prepared P-rhodamines provides first insight into dependence of fluorophore properties on the structure of P-rhodamines. A P-rhodamine with highest batochromic shifts and quantum yields in the class was identified."
1111,J,"A convenient two-step method is reported for the ligation of alkoxyamine- or hydrazine-bearing cargo to proline N-termini. Using this approach, bifunctional proline N-terminal bioconjugates are constructed and proline N-terminal proteins are immobilized."
1112,J,"Selective glycosylation of the C-6 fluorinated galactofuranosyl acceptor 2 was studied with four galactofuranosyl donors. It was highlighted that this electron-withdrawing atom strongly impacted the behavior of the acceptor, thus leading to unprecedented glycosylation pathways. Competition between expected glycosylation of 2, ring expansion of this acceptor and furanosylation, and intermolecular aglycon transfer was observed. Further investigation of the fluorinated synthetic compounds showed that the presence of fluorine atom contributed to increase the inhibition of the growth of Leishmania tarentolae, a non-pathogenic strain of Leishmania."
1113,J,"Acyl glucuronide metabolites have been implicated in the toxicity of several carboxylic acid-containing drugs, and the rate of their degradation via intramolecular transacylation and hydrolysis has been associated with the degree of protein adduct formation. Although not yet proven, the formation of protein adducts in vivo - and subsequent downstream effects - has been proposed as a mechanism of toxicity for carboxylic acid-containing xenobiotics capable of forming acyl glucuronides. A structurally-related series of metabolites, the acyl glucosides, have also been shown to undergo similar degradation reactions and consequently the potential to display a similar mode of toxicity. Here we report detailed kinetic models of each transacylation and hydrolysis reaction for a series of phenylacetic acid acyl glucuronides and their analogous acyl glucosides. Differences in reactivity were observed for the individual transacylation steps between the compound series; our findings suggest that the charged carboxylate ion and neutral hydroxyl group in the glucuronide and glucoside conjugates, respectively, are responsible for these differences. The transacylation reaction was modelled using density functional theory and the calculated activation energy for this reaction showed a close correlation with the degradation rate of the 1-beta anomer. Comparison of optimised geometries between the two series of conjugates revealed differences in hydrogen bonding which may further explain the differences in reactivity observed. Together, these models may find application in drug discovery for prediction of acyl glucuronide and glucoside metabolite behaviour."
1114,J,"In-depth, systematic photophysical studies have been performed on a series of ABAB, A(3)B and A(4) ZnPcs functionalized with a varying number of bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl units (i.e. at the B isoindoles) and other electron-withdrawing/electron-donating moieties (i.e. at the A isoindoles), to determine the influence of the susbtitution pattern on the aggregation features, fluorescence quantum yields and singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) generation abilities of these molecules. As a general trend, the larger the number of bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl units (i.e.ABAB crosswise functionalized ZnPcs), the lower the fluorescence quantum yield and the higher the O-1(2) photosensitization. On the other hand, the electronic character of the substituents at the A isoindoles do not seem to have a clear effect on the photophysical properties of these ABAB ZnPcs. Overall, O-1(2) quantum yields determined by the direct observation of the O-1(2) phosphorescence are very high, with values ranging from 1 to 0.74 in THF solutions."
1115,J,Structurally different bis(imino)copper(I) complexes were prepared in a highly modular manner and utilized as copper-based photo-catalysts in the ATRA reactions of styrenes and alkyl halides. The new photocatalysts showed good catalytic activity and ensured efficient chemical transformations.
1116,J,"A new methodology is described herein which converts simple and readily accesible furan substrates into complex enantio-enriched carbocyclic skeletons through the implementation of a simple one-pot procedure. Singlet oxygen furan photoxygenation affords an enedione which then participates in an organocatalysed double-Michael reaction with an enal to furnish a cyclopentanone structure with up to four new contiguous stereogenic centres. The enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity of this process are both excellent. If desired, further aldol-annulation steps can be appended to the cascade reaction sequence to afford key enantiopure hydrindane motifs."
1117,J,"2,4-Diamino-2,4,6-trideoxyglucose (bacillosamine) is a monosaccharide found in many pathogenic bacteria, variation in the functionalities appended to the amino groups occurs depending on the species the sugar is derived from. We here report the first synthesis of bacillosamine synthons that allow for the incorporation of two different functionalities at the C-2-N-acetyl and C-4-amines. We have developed chemistry to assemble a set of conjugation ready Neisseria meningitidis C-2-N-acetyl bacillosamine saccharides, carrying either an acetyl or (R)- or (S)-glyceroyl at the C-4 amine. The glyceroyl bacillosamines have been further extended at the C-3-OH with an alpha-d-galactopyranose to provide structures that occur as post-translational modifications of N. meningitidis PilE proteins, which make up the bacterial pili."
1118,J,"The nutraceutical Nicotinamide Riboside (NR), an efficacious biosynthetic precursor to NAD, is readily metabolized by the purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP). Access to the PNP-stable versions of NR is difficult because the glycosidic bond of NR is easily cleaved. Unlike NR, NRH, the reduced form of NR, offers sufficient chemical stability to allow the successful functionalisation of the ribosyl-moiety. Here, we report on a series of NRH and NR derived amino acid conjugates, generated in good to excellent yields and show that O5 '-esterification prevents the PNP-catalyzed phosphorolysis of these NR prodrugs."
1119,J,The first enantioselective method for the installation of the SCF3 group at the C-4 position of azlactones is described in the present communication under quinidinium phase transfer catalysis. The higher performance of substrates containing electron-rich 2-aryl groups at the azlactone was rationalized using DFT calculations.
1120,J,"The actin cytoskeleton is crucial for endocytosis, intracellular trafficking, cell shape maintenance and a wide range of other cellular functions. Recently introduced cell-permeable fluorescent actin probes, such as SiR-actin, suffer from poor membrane permeability and stain some cell populations inhomogeneously due to the active efflux by the plasma membrane pumps. We analyzed a series of new probes composed of jasplakinolide and modified rhodamine fluorophores and found that rhodamine positional isomerism has a profound effect on probe performance. The probes based on the 6'-carboxy-carbopyronine scaffold are considerably less susceptible to efflux and allow efficient staining without efflux pump inhibitors. They can be used for 2D and 3D fluorescence nanoscopy at high nanomolar concentrations without significant cytotoxicity. We show that jasplakinolide-based fluorescent probes bind not only to actin filaments, but also to G-actin, which enables imaging highly dynamic actin structures. We demonstrate an excellent performance of the new probes in multiple organisms and cell types: human cell lines, frog erythrocytes, fruit fly tissues and primary neurons."
1121,J,"Two myo-inositol derivatives having an N-alpha,N-epsilon-diacetyl-l-lysine (Ac(2)Lys) moiety linked to the inositol 1-O-position through a self-cleavable linker and a metabolically stable 2-azidoethyl group linked to the inositol 3-O- and 4-O-positions, respectively, were designed and synthesized. The Ac(2)Lys moiety blocking the inositol 1-O-position required for GPI biosynthesis was expected to be removable by a combination of two enzymes, histone deacetylase (HDAC) and cathepsin L (CTSL), abundantly expressed in cancer cells, but not in normal cells, to transform these inositol derivatives into biosynthetically useful products with a free 1-O-position. As a result, it was found that these inositol derivatives could be incorporated into the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) biosynthetic pathway by cancer cells, but not by normal cells, to express azide-labeled GPIs and GPI-anchored proteins on cell surfaces. Consequently, this study has established a novel strategy and new molecular tools for selective metabolic labeling of cancer cells, which should be useful for various biological studies and applications."
1122,J,"The alpha-oxo aldehyde is a highly reactive aldehyde for which many protein bioconjugation strategies exist. Here, we explore the genetic incorporation of a threonine-lysine dipeptide into proteins, harbouring a """"masked"""" alpha-oxo aldehyde that is rapidly unveiled in four minutes. The reactive aldehyde could undergo site-specific protein modification by SPANC ligation."
1123,J,"We describe an approach for the development of fluorescent sensors of metabolite binding in which a genetically encoded fluorescent non-canonical amino acid (fNCAA) containing a 7-hydroxycoumarin moiety (7-HCAA) forms a FRET pair with native tryptophan residues. Although previous studies demonstrated the potential for using 7-HCAA as an acceptor for tryptophan, this approach has not yet been explored within a single protein containing multiple tryptophan residues. A structure-based analysis of a hexokinase enzyme with multiple native tryptophan residues identified glutamate 50 as a potential site of 7-HCAA incorporation; Glu50 moves closer to the native tryptophans upon substrate binding. Substitution of 7-HCAA at residue 50 led to an increase in FRET efficiency in the presence of the substrate; this effect was not observed in a control protein where no change in distance between 7-HCAA and the native tryptophans occurs on substrate binding. This system was then used to directly observe differences in binding affinity of the hexokinase that occur at a number of pH values. Our approach builds on previous research in that it eliminates the need for the incorporation of multiple fNCAAs or fluorescent labels within a target protein and can be used to study substrate binding with native ligands. As such, it serves to expand the versatility of FRET-based techniques."
1124,J,"In spite of the growing interest in fluorine-containing compounds, and the improvements in materials, optical and biological properties that can arise from substitution of a phenyl ring by ferrocene within a molecular scaffold, synthetic strategies that allow the efficient preparation of fluoroferrocene derivatives are scarce. Following conversion of ferrocene to fluoroferrocene, we have developed routes to fluorine-containing di-, tri-, tetra- and penta-substituted ferrocene derivatives to extend the available chemical space. Our approach is based on the identification of suitable reagents and conditions to achieve fluorine-directed deprotometalation, and exploitation of the halogen 'dance' rearrangement in the ferrocene series."
1125,D,"The nutrition transition literature has generally drawn on epidemiologic and demographic changes to make its argument, because in many cases broader data are not available on the drivers of nutrition change. Going further, this paper draws on wider food systems literature, and includes food price and expenditure data, to join the dots from macroeconomic and food system change to food sources, production, and price; to household-level expenditures; to changing diets and nutrition and health outcomes, illustrated through the case of Zambia. Many of the economic and demographic drivers of the nutrition transition are present in Zambia, including rising GDP, high urbanization and increasing supermarket penetration. Food supply data show a reduction in calories available per capita over several decades, and low levels of nutrient-rich plant and animal source foods which make up a diverse, nutritious diet. National food price data show that while the cost of food has reduced overall, nutrient-rich foods are more expensive relative to staple foods over time. Expenditure on staple foods has reduced in the past two decades while spending on fruits and vegetables, animal source foods, fats and sugars, and processed foods has increased, with these change greater in rural areas in recent years, but already more advanced in urban areas. Finally, while undernutrition is reducing slowly from very high levels and hunger persists, overweight and obesity and non-communicable chronic diseases are increasing; and data are strikingly lacking on modern Zambian diets. The Zambia case study is placed within regional and global trends to illustrate nutrition transition changes that are now happening in rapidly changing lower-middle income countries. Policy responses include promoting the availability of diverse nutrient-dense foods, and concurrent attention to preventing under- and over-nutrition in surveillance and policy. This paper also sheds light on the gaps in information that would greatly improve our understanding of the food system drivers of the nutrition transition, and hence our ability to create relevant policy."
1126,D,"The traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) of Lacandon Maya is expressed in their swidden (i.e., slash-and-burn), sequential agroforestry system. Successional pathways are initiated through controlled burns of secondary forest and by cultivating milpa: a swidden polyculture agroecosystem dominated by maize (corn; Zea mays). While past research demonstrated that traditional Maya milpas yield large quantities of corn that can meet caloric requirements for Lacandon communities, no studies have comprehensively quantified the yields of other crops cultivated in Lacandon milpas or assessed whether they can meet other nutritional requirements for local people. Using a case study approach, this research measured the agricultural yields and nutritional content of all foods (including crops and wild game) harvested from a traditional Lacandon milpa. Following traditional Lacandon agroforestry management practices, we performed a controlled burn of secondary forest and planted crops and trees in an experimental milpa in Lacanja Chansayab, Chiapas, Mexico. Over 3 years, we harvested, weighed, and calculated the nutritional content of all foodstuffs obtained from the milpa. Assuming an average family size of 5.3 individuals, yields from an average-sized milpa can meet most United States Food and Drug Administration daily value nutritional requirements per capita, including calories, fat, carbohydrates, fiber, sugar, protein, vitamins A and C, calcium, iron, zinc, and niacin. Diets derived exclusively from milpa may be deficient in saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, calcium, and iodine, and harvests varyintra- and inter-annually. Lacandon farmers can supplement these harvests by foraging in their managed forest. These results underscore the potential of Lacandon agroforestry management to provide rural smallholder farmers in the Lacandon rainforest with food sovereignty while maintaining nearby forest cover to conserve biodiversity and other ecosystem services."
1127,D,"We investigated wheat price relationships between the import-dependent countries in Central Asia and the South Caucasus and the Black Sea wheat exporters to assess wheat market efficiency. This is crucial for ensuring availability and access to wheat and for reducing food insecurity. Results from linear and threshold error correction models suggested a strong influence of trade costs on market integration in Central Asia, while those costs were of minor importance in the South Caucasus. In particular, wheat trade in Central Asia is characterized by higher transportation costs but unofficial payments also play a large role. In addition, wheat price volatility is substantially higher in the wheat importing countries of Central Asia compared to the South Caucasus. To foster market functioning, wheat trade should be facilitated by policies that reduce the costs of trade. These include investments in grain market infrastructure, eliminating unofficial payments, and resolving geopolitical conflicts. Additionally, large distances characterize wheat trade in this region, low scope for import diversification and repeated export restrictions by Black Sea exporters. Therefore, trade-enhancing policies should be complemented with policies that increase wheat self-sufficiency in order to improve food security."
1128,D,"Nonfarm employment has been increasingly important in improving food security of rural households in the developing world. In this paper, we (1) determine the factors explaining the participation in nonfarm employment and nonfarm income of rural households by employing a two-part random effects econometric model, and (2) examine the effects of nonfarm employment on rural household food security indicators by combining the propensity score matching with the difference-in-differences approach. We used a panel dataset of 561 households in 30 villages of Stung Treng province in Cambodia collected in 2013 and 2014. Our sample was divided into two groups, households with nonfarm employment, and households without nonfarm employment. Our findings show that (1) nonfarm employment contributed about 32% to total annual household income for the whole sample and 57% for the households with nonfarm employment; (2) participation in nonfarm employment and nonfarm income were significantly influenced by the education level of household heads, numbers of motorbikes and mobile phones, conditions of roads to the villages, farmland size, number of income shocks, and the distance from home to the nearest market; (3) there was no significant difference in terms of food availability between households with and households without nonfarm employment but the former have improved food access, utilization, and stability. We suggest that promoting rural education, improving road conditions, and empowering rural households to cope with income shocks would contribute to developing nonfarm employment and consequently improve food security of rural households."
1129,D,"Large numbers of South Africans receive social grants (public transfers) or remittances (private transfers), and yet one in four South Africans is food insecure. The purpose of this paper is to address two questions: do social grants and remittances improve food security and nutritional outcomes? If so, do these impacts differ between public and private transfers? Drawing on the National Income Dynamic Survey (NIDS), South Africa's first nationally representative survey that follows more than 28,000 individuals over time, we found significant and positive impacts of the Older Person's Grant and of remittances on the dietary diversity index, but not of the Child Support Grant. Moreover, we found no effect on food expenditure or on anthropometry (BMI) by the Older Person's Grant, or remittances. However, some positive effects were found on children's BMI from the Child Support Grant. We discuss why we observe different effects from different transfers, as well as giving several reasons why income transfers are failing to close the nutritional deficits in South Africa."
1130,D,"Food availability and access are strongly affected by seasonality in rural households in Ethiopia. However, relationships between household food insecurity indicators and dietary diversity and nutritional status of reproductive age mothers and their young children are unclear. A longitudinal study was conducted among 800 farming households in lowland and midland agro-ecological zones of rural Ethiopia in pre and post-harvest seasons. A structured interview, which included measures of three food access indicators - household food insecurity access scale (HFIAS), household dietary diversity score (HDDS) and household food consumption score (HFCS)-was conducted. Additionally, a subset of 183 households was selected for assessment of indicators of nutritional status including maternal and child dietary diversity and anthropometric measurements for children 6-23months of age. Magnitudes of household food insecurity indices were high by international standards, particularly during the lean season (pre-harvest). Using correlation, Chi square and multivariable regression models, HFCS in both seasons was related to maternal body mass index and haemoglobin, and weight-for-length of their children. HDDS was associated in the post-harvest season with haemoglobin level of the mothers, and weight-for-length of their children. HFCS was a better predictor of nutritional status of mothers and children in both the food surplus and lean seasons, while HDDS was a better predictor of maternal and child nutritional status post-harvest. It is recommended that nutritional interventions should therefore focus on household food insecurity as well as targeting the individual nutritional status of mothers and children."
1131,D,"The importance of forests in supporting the well-being of poor rural communities cannot be overstated, not only for improving food security but also for biodiversity conservation. For many people living in developing regions of the world, forests provide healthy and nutrient-dense foods which can improve overall diet quality and act as a safety net during times of hardship. Forests can also provide a source of income and facilitate certain agricultural practices, potentially allowing for poverty alleviation and mitigation. This study examined whether there was a relationship between forest cover and diet quality at the household level in rural southern Malawi. Nutrition data for 2084 households, collected as part of the 2010/11 Third Integrated Household Survey for Malawi (IHS3), were compared with a satellite-based land-cover map of Malawi. Households located in areas with a high percentage forest cover had significantly improved vitamin A adequacy compared to households in less forested areas. Also, vitamin A intake was significantly improved by consumption of wild plant foods. Forest cover was not associated with any other indicators of diet quality, but a number of social and demographic factors were significant determinants, including household size, education and access to markets. Further investigation of these associations is imperative at a time when forests are being cleared at an alarming rate to make way for agricultural production."
1132,D,"The adoption of improved varieties is an important indicator of the effectiveness of agricultural research. This study quantified the adoption of improved mungbean (Vigna radiata (L). Wilczek) varieties and agricultural practices in Bangladesh, India, Myanmar and Pakistan using an expert elicitation approach. Data were collected from 19 expert panels, organized at subnational levels and involving a total of 259 mungbean experts. The study found that improved varieties were planted on 94% of the mungbean area in Pakistan, 89% in Myanmar, 82% in India and 72% in Bangladesh. International mungbean breeding research conducted by the World Vegetable Center has had a major impact with its germplasm adopted by an estimated 1.2 million mungbean farmers and grown on 1.8 million hectares of land. Widespread variation in the adoption of improved technologies at subnational levels point to opportunities for increased mungbean yields such as the adoption of line sowing and mechanical harvesting, the use of seed treatments with biofertilizers and biopesticides, and the adoption of better varieties with more comprehensive disease resistance."
1133,D,"This study aims to assess and compare food security and its socio-demographic correlates in 18 Middle East and North African (MENA) countries that fall under the auspices of the World Health Organization Regional Office of the Eastern Mediterranean (EMRO). This cross-sectional study is based on data from the 2016 Gallup World Poll. The study sample included an average of 1000 individuals per country (n=18,079). Food security status of individuals was measured using the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES). Various statistical analyses such as descriptive, bivariate, and binary logistic regression were conducted. Countries were categorized into three clusters based on frequency of moderate to severe food insecurity, as well as political stability index and per capita income. The frequency of severe food insecurity was significantly lower in countries in cluster 1 (rich, stable) (5.0%) compared to the second (middle-low income, less stable) (13.6%), and third (middle-low income, unstable) (26.7%) clusters (P<0.001). Based on logistic regression analyses, income quintile per capita, personal health index and education levels were the main predictors of food insecurity in all three clusters. The results provide insight into the diversity of the MENA countries studied and the different policy options needed to improve their food security."
1134,D,"In this paper, we examined how food insecurity can affect international migration aspirations and subsequent actions taken in preparation to move internationally from Sub-Saharan Africa. Drawing on a conceptual framework of the determinants of migration, we developed a three-stage regression model and tested it using data from the 2014 Gallup World Poll. The results indicate that multiple determinants play different roles in the migration decision process, which is characterized by aspirations, planning and final decision to migrate. Specifically, food insecurity is an important determinant of both the desire and the decision to migrate: food insecurity raises the probability of desiring to migrate internationally, with the probability of the desire increasing along with the severity of food insecurity. However, the probability of actually deciding to migrate internationally decreased as food insecurity worsened. These findings are in line with migration literature stating that the very poor, despite wishing to migrate, face tremendous constraints in transforming this desire into concrete decisions. Our results suggest that removing or reducing constraints to migration will benefit the poorest/most food insecure and highlight the need for an increased and effective coordination between food security and international migration policy agendas."
1135,D,"Governmental and developmental partners invest substantial resources to reduce land and water degradation in order to upgrade agricultural productivity, thus reducing food insecurity and related vulnerability in Sub-Saharan Africa. Understanding the impact of soil and water conservation on food insecurity outcomes would be a significant step toward improving environmental conditions, while ensuring sustainable and increased agricultural production. Therefore, this article analyzes the impact of adopting soil and water conservation on food insecurity and related vulnerability outcomes of farming households using a sample of 408 households selected using a multi-stage stratified sampling procedure from three districts in eastern Ethiopia. Vulnerability as expected poverty (three-step Feasible General Least Squares) is employed to analyze the vulnerability of sample households in the context of food insecurity. In addition, endogenous switching regressions with propensity score matching methods are combined to obtain consistent impact estimates. The study findings reveal that education and sex of household head, use of irrigation and fertilizer, source of information, and cultivated land are the main factors influencing the adoption of soil and water conservation practices. Moreover, the adoption of soil and water conservation not only positively impacts the per capita food consumption expenditure and net crop value, but it also significantly reduces the probability of farmers being food insecure, vulnerable to food insecurity, as well as being transient and chronically food insecure. Therefore, policymakers and development organizations should consider soil and water conservation as a main strategy to reduce land degradation and improve the livelihoods of the rural farm households."
1136,D,"Food security is a major challenge in Guatemala, one of the poorest countries in the world. Food insecurity is concentrated in the Western Highlands of Guatemala (WHG) where indigenous communities have been the main victims of social, political and economic marginalization. In this study we characterize the diversity of farming households in the WHG, identify the main sources of food for different types of farm households and assess their food security status through a simple, yet robust, potential food availability indicator. Based on a large and rich dataset of nearly 5000 farm households, our results show the diversity of farming systems in the region, dominated by maize and coffee production, as well as the large differences in their potential food availability. In our model, 52% of farm households in the WHG did not have the means to attain sufficient energy from their agricultural activities. In general, diversified maize-based, coffee-based and specialized coffee farm households had larger proportions of potentially food secure households with 60%, 83% and 74% food secure households, respectively. This contrasted with farm households specialized in maize production and resource-constrained households where there were a greater proportion of households were food insecure. The analytical framework presented here, combining a typology of farm households and their livelihoods with the analysis of their food security status, provides a useful approach for better targeting development interventions towards combating hunger, poverty and malnutrition."
1137,D,"Rwanda has experienced significant economic growth following the 1994 Genocide. This growth is attributed to the expansion of its agricultural sector, specifically farming intensification and the government's focus on creating strong agriculture cooperatives. While Rwanda's economic development has been impressive, many academics have argued that Rwanda's growth comes at the cost of an authoritarian governmental regime, whose policies have too heavy a hand in the daily activities of smallholder farming. This study measures smallholder maize farmer loyalty to their cooperatives using the net promoter scores of five different cooperatives. Results differ from much of the recent research on smallholder farmers in Rwanda in that most cooperative members have high levels of trust in their cooperative leaders. Cooperative members who have high levels of trust in their cooperative president, board and the Government of Rwanda are more likely to recommend their cooperative to friends and family. Furthermore, women cooperative members have higher levels of trust in cooperative leadership, the Government of Rwanda and almost all agricultural input providers mentioned in the study. Findings suggest that cooperative policy, most notably the mandatory inclusion of high numbers of women in cooperative decision-making, is helping to promote strong agricultural institutions as well as sustainable economic development."
1138,D,"This paper concerns Drought-Tolerant Maize (DTM) and Conservation Agriculture (CA) practices that were introduced into smallholder maize-based farming systems in Zimbabwe to enhance the productivity of maize and food security under a changing climate. Although these technologies are technically appropriate, there are difficulties with their use by smallholder farmers of relatively low socio-economic status, as measured through ownership of farm or household assets and endowments. Thus, we sought to quantify and explain wealth-related inequalities in the adoption of DTM and CA in smallholder farming communities and discuss their implications for food security. The analysis used cross-sectional household-level data gathered from 601 smallholder farmers from four districts in Zimbabwe. We found evidence of a pro-rich distribution of inequalities in the adoption of DTM and CA that were mostly explained by differences in household wealth, access to agricultural extension services and size of farm land. No meaningful differences in DTM adoption disparities were found across districts. Significant gender differences were observed for CA, and meaningful differences by district were noted. Results suggest the need for decision makers to consider implementing policies that focus on the poorer segments of the farming society to alleviate differences in the adoption of such agricultural technologies. For example, subsidizing the uptake of improved maize varieties including DTM and prioritizing equitable land distribution, coupled with specialised extension services for the poor in a cereal-based CA farming system, could reduce the observed gap between rich and poor in the uptake of these innovations and consequently improve food security."
1139,D,"Historically, India has relied on subsidizing staple food as a major instrument in improving food security. Recently, however, cash transfers have entered the debate as an alternative, as they are associated with lower market distortions, leakages and fiscal costs. This study contributes to this debate by analyzing India's Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS). Our main objective was to explain the under-purchase, or low take-up, from the TPDS, which is typically attributed to 'leakage', i.e. the diversion of food grains from eligible consumers. We provide an alternative solution based on self-targeting; while poorer households increase their consumption from the TPDS, wealthier households restrain from consuming subsidized commodities. Using a large household dataset, we estimated that such a voluntary opt-out system, based on income, would save a minimum of 6.5% of grains released through the TPDS. Besides these demand-driven aspects, our analysis indicates that poor regions perform better at lowering the diversion of grains and that large targeting errors exist among female-led households. Finally, we find substantial regional price differences that would benefit the poor and rural population under a uniform cash-transfer system that does not correct for regional price levels."
1140,H,"In this article, we introduce a novel curvelet transform by combining the merits of the well-known curvelet and linear canonical transforms. The motivation towards the endeavour spurts from the fundamental question of whether it is possible to increase the flexibility of the curvelet transform to optimize the concentration of the curvelet spectrum. By invoking the fundamental relationship between the Fourier and linear canonical transforms, we formulate a novel family of curvelets, which is comparatively flexible and enjoys certain extra degrees of freedom. The preliminary analysis encompasses the study of fundamental properties including the formulation of reconstruction formula and Rayleigh's energy theorem. Subsequently, we develop the Heisenberg-type uncertainty principle for the novel curvelet transform. Nevertheless, to extend the scope of the present study, we introduce the semidiscrete and discrete analogues of the novel curvelet transform. Finally, we present an example demonstrating the construction of novel curvelet waveforms in a lucid manner."

Generalized versions of the Hadamard and the Fejer-Hadamard fractional integral inequalities for harmonically (alpha, h - m)-convex functions via generalized fractional integral operators are proved. From presented results, a series of fractional integral inequalities can be obtained for harmonically convex, harmonically (h - m)-convex, harmonically (alpha, m)-convex, and related functions and for already known fractional integral operators."

1145,H,"In this paper, the authors consider a IBVP for the time-space fractional PDE with the fractional conformable derivative and the fractional Laplace operator. A fractional conformable extremum principle is presented and proved. Based on the extremum principle, a maximum principle for the fractional conformable Laplace system is established. Furthermore, the maximum principle is applied to the linear space-time fractional Laplace conformable differential system to obtain a new comparison theorem. Besides that, the uniqueness and continuous dependence of the solution of the above system are also proved."

In fact, we introduce the notions of hybrid p-ideal, hybrid h-ideal, and hybrid a-ideal in BCI-algebras and investigate their related properties. Furthermore, we show that every hybrid p-ideal (or h-ideal or a-ideal) is a hybrid ideal in a BCI-algebra but converse need not be true in general and in support, and we exhibit counter examples for each case. Moreover, we consider characterizations of hybrid p-ideal, hybrid h-ideal, and hybrid a-ideal in BCI-algebras."

1148,H,"Bridge regression is a special family of penalized regressions using a penalty function Sigma vertical bar A(j)vertical bar(c) n-ary sumation gamma >= 1 with gamma >= 1 that for gamma=1 and gamma=2, it concludes lasso and ridge regression, respectively. In case where the output variable in the regression model was imprecise, we developed a bridge regression model in a fuzzy environment. We also exhibited penalized fuzzy estimates for this model when the input variables were crisp. So, we perform the presented optimization problem for the model that leads to a multiobjective program. Also, we try to determine the shrinkage parameter and the tuning parameter from the same optimization problem. In order to estimate fuzzy coefficients of the proposed model, we introduce a hybrid scheme based on recurrent neural networks. The suggested neural network model is constructed based on some concepts of convex optimization and stability theory which guarantees to find the approximate parameters of the proposed model. We use a simulation study to depict the performance of the proposed bridge technique in the presence of multicollinear data. Furthermore, real data analysis is used to show the performance of the proposed method. A comparison between the fuzzy bridge regression model and several other shrinkage models is made with three different well-known fuzzy criteria. In this study, we visualize the performance of the model by Taylor's diagram and Bubble plot. Also, we examine the predictive ability of the model, thus, obtained by cross validation. The numerical results clearly showed higher accuracy of the proposed fuzzy bridge method compared to the other existing fuzzy regression models: fuzzy bridge regression model, multiobjective optimization, recurrent neural network, stability convergence, and goodness-of-fit measure."
1149,H,"Thee aim of this work is to define some concepts on supra topological spaces using supra preopen sets and investigate main properties. We started this paper by correcting some results obtained in previous study and presenting further properties of supra preopen sets.,en, we introduce a concept of supra prehomeomorphism maps and discuss its main properties. After that we explore the concepts of supra limit and supra boundary points of a set with respect to supra preopen sets and examine their behaviours on the spaces that possess the difference property. Finally, we formulate the concepts of supra pre- T i-spaces (i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) and give completely descriptions for each one of them. In general, we study their main properties in detail and show the implications of these separation axioms among themselves as well as with ST i -space with the help of some interesting examples."
1150,H,"This work is dedicated to the study of the relationship between altitude and barometric atmospheric pressure. There is a consistent literature on this relationship, out of which an ordinary differential equation with initial value problems is often used for modeling. Here, we proposed a new modeling technique of the relationship using Caputo and Caputo-Fabrizio fractional differential equations. First, the proposed model is proven well-defined through existence and uniqueness of its solution. Caputo-Fabrizio fractional derivative is the main tool used throughout the proof. Then, follow experimental study using real world dataset. The experiment has revealed that the Caputo fractional derivative is the most appropriate tool for fitting the model, since it has produced the smallest error rate of 1.74% corresponding to the fractional order of derivative alpha = 1.005. Caputo-Fabrizio was the second best since it yielded an error rate value of 1.97% for a fractional order of derivative alpha = 1.042, and finally the classical method produced an error rate of 4.36%."
1151,H,"Graph theory and its wide applications in natural sciences and social sciences open a new era of research. Making the graph of computer networks and analyzing it with aid of graph theory are extensively studied and researched in the literature. An important discussion is based on distance between two nodes in a network which may include closeness of objects, centrality of objects, average path length between objects, and vertex eccentricity. For example, (1) disease transmission networks: closeness and centrality of objects are used to measure vulnerability to particular disease and its infectivity; (2) routing networks: eccentricity of objects is used to find vertices which form the periphery objects of the network. In this manuscript, we have discussed distance measurements including center, periphery, and average eccentricity for the Cartesian product of two cycles. The results are obtained using the definitions of eccentricity, radius, and diameter of a graph, and all possible cases (for different parity of length of cycles) have been proved."
1152,H,"Th)e major concern of this article is to propose the notion of picture fuzzy rough sets (PFRSs) over two different universes which depend on (delta, zeta, theta)-cut of picture fuzzy relation R on two different universes (i.e., by combining picture fuzzy sets (PFSs) with rough sets (RSs)).)en, we discuss several interesting properties and related results on the PFRSs. Furthermore, we define some notions related to PFRSs such as (Type-I/Type-II) graded PFRSs, the degree alpha and beta with respect to R-[(delta,R- zeta,R- theta)] on PFRSs, and (Type-I/Type-II) generalized PFRSs based on the degree alpha and beta with respect to R-[(delta,R- zeta,R- theta)] and investigate the basic properties of above notions. Finally, an approach based on the rough picture fuzzy approximation operators on two different universes in decisionmaking problem is introduced, and we give an example to show the validity of this approach."
1153,H,"In this paper, we study the uniqueness questions of finite order transcendental entire functions and their difference operators sharing a set consisting of two distinct entire functions of finite smaller order.

1154,H,"In this paper, a direct meshless method (DMM), which is based on the radial basis function, is developed to the numerical solution of the two-dimensional second-order hyperbolic telegraph equations. Since these hyperbolic telegraph equations are time dependent, we present two schemes for the basis functions from radial and nonradial aspects. The first scheme is fulfilled by considering time variable as normal space variable to construct an """"isotropic"""" space-time radial basis function. The other scheme considered a realistic relationship between space variable and time variable which is not radial. The time-dependent variable is treated regularly during the whole solution process and the hyperbolic telegraph equations can be solved in a direct way. Numerical experiments performed with the proposed numerical scheme for several two-dimensional second-order hyperbolic telegraph equations are presented with some discussions, which show that the DMM solutions are converging very fast in comparison with the various existing numerical methods."
1155,H,"Recently, there is a rapid increase of research in the area of Quantum calculus (known as q-calculus) due to its widespread applications in many areas of study, such as geometric functions theory. To this end, using the concept of q-conic domains of Janowski type as well as q- calculus, new subclasses of analytic functions are introduced. This family of functions extends the notion of alpha-convex and quasi-convex functions. Furthermore, a coefficient inequality, sufficiency criteria, and covering results for these novel classes are derived. Besides, some remarkable consequences of our investigation are highlighted."

1158,H,"This paper proposes a new control chart for the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution based on multiple dependent state repetitive sampling (MDSRS). The proposed control chart is a generalization of the control charts based on single sampling, repetitive sampling, and multiple dependent state sampling. Its sensitivity is evaluated in terms of the average run length (ARL) using both exact formulae and simulations. A comprehensive comparison between the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution control chart based on the MDSRS method and other existing competing methods is provided using a simulation study as well as a real-life illustration. The results reveal that the proposed chart outperforms the existing charts considered in this study by having better shift detection ability."
1159,H,"This paper deals with fuzzy quasinormed spaces in the sense of Alegre and Romaguera. After introducing the concept of the family of star quasiseminorms, we prove the decomposition theorem for a fuzzy quasinorm with general t-norm, characterize fuzzy quasinorms in terms of families of star quasiseminorms, and establish the connection between the fuzzy quasinorm and the family of quasinorms."
1160,H,"We develop the multiwavelet Galerkin method to solve the Volterra-Fredholm integral equations. To this end, we represent the Volterra and Fredholm operators in multiwavelet bases. Then, we reduce the problem to a linear or nonlinear system of algebraic equations. The interesting results arise in the linear type where thresholding is employed to decrease the nonzero entries of the coefficient matrix, and thus, this leads to reduction in computational efforts. The convergence analysis is investigated, and numerical experiments guarantee it. To show the applicability of the method, we compare it with other methods and it can be shown that our results are better than others."
1161,H,"In this paper, we establish some theorems of fixed point on multivalued mappings satisfying contraction mapping by using gauge function. Furthermore, we use Q- and R-order of convergence.

1162,H,"The performance of the parameter-free conical radial basis functions accompanied with the Chebyshev node generation is investigated for the solution of boundary value problems. In contrast to the traditional conical radial basis function method, where the collocation points are placed uniformly or quasi-uniformly in the physical domain of the boundary value problems in question, we consider three different Chebyshev-type schemes to generate the collocation points. This simple scheme improves accuracy of the method with no additional computational cost. Several numerical experiments are given to show the validity of the newly proposed method."

1164,H,"As a generalization of the intuitionistic fuzzy number (IFN), the linguistic interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy number (LIVIFN) is a flexible and superior tool to describe complex fuzzy uncertainty information. Heronian mean (HM) operator has the characteristic of considering the relationship between attributes. Extended copulas (ECs) and extended cocopulas (ECCs) are the promotion form of Archimedean t-norm and t-conorm (ATT). ECs and ECCs can generate versatile operational rules and can provide more choice for decision makers (DMs). Therefore, it is very necessary to take advantages of them. In this paper, ECs and ECCs, some specifics of ECs and ECCs, and score and accuracy functions of IVILFNs are gained first. Then, we propose the linguistic interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy weighted copula Heronian mean (LIVIFWCHM) operator; also, some properties and five specific expressions of the LIVIFWCHM operator are discussed. Moreover, we also propose a new MAGDM approach based on the proposed LIVIFWCHM operator. Finally, a set of examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness, generality, and flexibility of the proposed method."
1165,H,"Concrete, one of the sources of energy consumption and carbon emissions, is widely used in the construction industry. The selection of concrete materials raises the question of energy sustainability and turns it into a complex multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) issue. To address this, we present an MCDM framework based on the intuitionistic linguistic hybrid weighted logarithmic averaging distance (ILHWLAD). To begin with, the intuitionistic linguistic numbers are used to deal with the uncertainty and fuzziness of the decision-making process. In addition, in view of the significance and the ordered position of the input arguments, an intuitionistic linguistic hybrid weighted logarithmic averaging distance (ILHWLAD) operator is defined. We, then, initiate the criteria system and present the MCDM framework based on the ILHWLAD to select the finest concrete. A case study involving four alternative materials, namely, autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC), hollow concrete blocks (HCB), expanded polystyrene (EPS), and lime hemp concrete (LHC), is presented to verify the scientificity of the framework."
1166,H,"In this paper the two-parameter alpha-power exponential distribution is studied. We study the two-parameter alpha-power exponential mu,lambda distribution with the location parameter mu > 0 and scale parameter lambda > 0 under progressive Type-II censored data with fixed shape parameter alpha. We estimate the maximum likelihood estimators of these unknown parameters numerically since it cannot be solved analytically. We use the approximate best linear unbiased estimators mu* and lambda*, as an initial guesses to obtain the MLEs (mu) over cap and (lambda) over cap. We estimate the interval estimation of these unknowns' parameters. Monte Carlo simulations are performed and data examples have been provided for illustration and comparison."
1167,H,"We propose a stochastic predator-prey model to study a novel idea that involves investigating random noises effects on the enrichment paradox phenomenon. Existence and stochastic boundedness of a unique positive solution with positive initial conditions are proved. The global asymptotic stability is studied to determine the occurrence of the enrichment paradox phenomenon. We show theoretically that intensive noises play an important role in the occurrence of the phenomenon, where increasing intensive noises lead to occurrence of the paradox of enrichment. We perform numerical simulations to verify and demonstrate the theoretical results. The new results in this study may contribute to increasing attention to study the random noise effects on some ecological and biological phenomena as the paradox of enrichment."

1169,H,"We show that if G is a 3-vertex-connected C-4-free graph of order n and radius r, then the inequality r <= (2n/9) + O(1) holds. Moreover, graphs are constructed to show that the bounds are asymptotically sharp."
1170,H,"Let R be a ring, tau = (T, F) a hereditary torsion theory of mod-R, and n a positive integer. Then, R is called right tau-n-coherent if every n-presented right R-module is (tau, n + 1)-presented. We present some characterizations of right tau-n-coherent rings, as corollaries, and some characterizations of right n-coherent rings and right tau-coherent rings are obtained."
1171,H,"This article focuses on controlling single-input-single-output (SISO) nonlinear systems with actuator failures via sliding mode control (SMC) and composite learning SMC (CLSMC). In the design of the SMC, an integer-order sliding surface is proposed, and an adaptive law is constructed to update the parameter evaluation in the actuator failure. The SMC method can achieve the tracking error approaching zero if a strict permanent excitation (PE) condition is satisfied. To mitigate this requirement, by using all data recorded while the controller works, we construct prediction errors that are utilized to produce a composite learning adaptive law. Then, the proposed CLSMC method not only drives the tracking error to zero but also realizes the accurate evaluation of the unmatched unknown parameter in the actuator failure. In addition, in the proposed CLSMC method, we only need to satisfy an interval excitation (IE) condition. Simulation results are presented to indicate the validity of our methods."
1172,H,"The class of exponentially (alpha, h - m)-convex functions has been discovered to unify different kinds of convexities. *is paper finds new Riemann-Liouville fractional Hadamard-type inequalities for this generalized class of convex functions. *ese results further have their consequences which are presented in the form of corollaries. Moreover, some known results are identified in the form of remarks."
1173,H,"The notion of bipolar soft sets has already been defined, but in this article, the notion of bipolar soft sets has been redefined, called T-bipolar soft sets. It is shown that the new approach is more close to the concept of bipolarity as compared to the previous ones, and further it is discussed that so far in the study of soft sets and their generalizations, the concept introduced in this manuscript has never been discussed earlier. We have also discussed the operational laws of T-bipolar soft sets and their basic properties. In the end, we have deliberated the algebraic structures associated with T-bipolar soft sets and the applications of T-bipolar soft sets in decision-making problems."
1174,H,"The crucial role that fuzzy implications play in many applicable areas was our motivation to revisit the topic of them. In this paper, we apply classical logic's laws such as De Morgan's laws and the classical law of double negation in known formulas of fuzzy implications. These applications lead to new families of fuzzy implications. Although a duality in properties of the preliminary and induced families is expected, we will prove that this does not hold, in general. Moreover, we will prove that it is not ensured that these applications lead us to fuzzy implications, in general, without restrictions. We generate and study three induced families, the so-called D '-implications, QL '-implications, and R '-implications. Each family is the """"closest"""" to its preliminary-""""creator"""" family, and they both are simulating the same (or a similar) way of classical thinking."
1175,H,"In this article, we investigate the sufficient conditions on weighted Nakano sequence space to be premodular Banach (sss). We examine some topological and geometrical structures of the multiplication operators defined on weighted Nakano prequasi-normed (sss)."
1176,H,"In this paper, we developed two new numerical algorithms for finding zeros of nonlinear equations in one dimension and one of them is second derivative free which has been removed using the interpolation technique. We derive these algorithms with the help of Taylor's series expansion and Golbabai and Javidi's method. The convergence analysis of these algorithms is discussed. It is established that the newly developed algorithms have sixth order of convergence. Several numerical examples have been solved which prove the better efficiency of these algorithms as compared to other well-known iterative methods of the same kind. Finally, the comparison of polynomiographs generated by other well-known iterative methods with our developed algorithms has been made which reflects their dynamical aspects."
1177,H,"This paper is devoted to a study of the concept of edge-group choosability of graphs. We say that G is edge-k-group choosable if its line graph is k-group choosable.

1178,H,"The purpose of this paper is to introduce the extragradient methods for solving split feasibility problems, generalized equilibrium problems, and fixed point problems involved in nonexpansive mappings and pseudocontractive mappings. We establish the results of weak and strong convergence under appropriate conditions. As applications of our three main theorems, when the mappings and their domains take different types of cases, we can obtain nine iterative approximation theorems and corollas on fixed points, variational inequality solutions, and equilibrium points."
1179,H,"Using the fixed point approach, we investigate a general hyperstability results for the following k-cubic functional equations f(kx + y) + f(kx - y) = kf(x + y) + kf(x - y) + 2k(k(2) - 1) f(x), where k is a fixed positive integer >= 2, in ultrametric Banach spaces."
1180,H,"In this paper, a characterization theorem for the S-transform of infinite dimensional distributions of noncommutative white noise corresponding to the (p, q)-deformed quantum oscillator algebra is investigated. We derive a unitary operator U between the noncommutative L-2-space and the (p, q)-Fock space which serves to give the construction of a white noise Gel'fand triple. Next, a general characterization theorem is proven for the space of (p, q)-Gaussian white noise distributions in terms of new spaces of (p, q)- entire functions with certain growth rates determined by Young functions and a suitable (p, q)-exponential map."

1182,I,"The hot spot occurring in outlier solar cells is recognized as one of the main reliability issues for photovoltaic modules. Even though PV modules are qualified to sustain over-temperatures the hot spot can lead to accelerated aging and, sometimes, to unexpected failure, with the possible risk of fire. The standard countermeasure to contrast this phenomenon is the adoption of bypass diodes, whose role is to limit the maximum reverse voltage across outlier cells. However, since the current is not limited, power dissipation can be high. In this paper a bypass circuit, suited to completely avoiding the onset of the hot spot, is presented. The circuit is a substantial improvement of a previous version that was able to reduce power dissipation by reducing the voltage across the reverse biased solar cell. The improvement presented in this paper allow to completely cancel the current, thus avoiding power dissipation and, therefore, preventing the rising in temperature of the solar cell. The novelty with respect to comparable approaches is that the intervention of the circuit doesn't require the preliminary detection of the hot spot. Indeed, the circuit self-activates in the same operating conditions of standard diodes, without needing neither control logic nor power supply. Detailed circuit simulations and experiments are presented to evidence the capability of the circuit to fully prevent power dissipation, and consequent rising in temperature, in outlier cells."
1183,I,"Obtaining reliable information on the thermal performance of a receiver in a solar thermal power plant during the design phase is essential for optimisation purposes and for the determination of the economic performance of the entire power plant. In open volumetric receivers, where the heat transfer circuit is open to the environment, this task is particularly challenging due to the influence of convection phenomena on the air return ratio and thus the heat losses. These losses can only be estimated by means of CFD simulations, however, since the small scale absorber structure is several orders of magnitude smaller than the receiver itself, the required computational grid becomes too large to be economically viable. In this paper a modelling approach is presented, which for the first time allows the efficient simulation of the entire receiver including the flow in front of and around the receiver while at the same time considering internal heat transfer within the absorber. A set of boundary conditions has been developed for the absorber surface of open volumetric receivers in which the characteristic behaviour of the absorber is modelled without the need of detailed resolution of the absorber structure. The model has been validated against new measurements at the solar tower Julich. Moreover, in comparison with literature data of air return ratio measurements a very good agreement was found. A characteristic map of the receiver efficiency has been compiled showing peak efficiencies of the open volumetric receiver of the solar tower Julich of 70.9% at a hot air temperature of 650 degrees C and 75.4% at 450 degrees C. The model can now be used for the assessment of design concepts for commercial power plants."
1184,I,"The ability of designated electrically insulating materials in a module, including the backsheet, to act as insulators is a key safety requirement for photovoltaic technology. The recently developed test standards IEC TS 62788-2 (including a method for direct-current breakdown-voltage) and IEC TS 62788-7-2 (for ultraviolet [UV] weathering) are examined for the first time together in this study. Thirty-six contemporary backsheets were compared using the breakdown-voltage test, before and after UV weathering, according to the recent A3 test condition. Twenty-eight backsheets, extracted from a variety of veteran photovoltaic modules, were also examined using the breakdown test. Additional characterizations were performed to interpret the breakdown-voltage results, including: surface and cross-sectional optical microscopy failure analysis; cross-sectional scanning electron (SEM) microscopy with EDS energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) failure analysis; Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to identify the base resin and its chemical integrity; and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to identify phase transitions that might adversely affect degradation during weathering. The electrical insulation for the backsheets is discussed relative to: the industry safety requirement; features observed to facilitate the degradation of insulation; the validity of the artificial UV weathering test; the validity of the sheet geometry used for specimens in this study; and the validity of subsequent mechanical testing."
1185,I,"Moving bed heat exchangers are a central element in solar thermal power plants using granular heat transfer fluids. Their performance is determined by a complex granular flow field in the device. This calls for accurate simulation models forming the basis for novel design tools. In this study we propose a discrete element model (DEM) to calculate the dense granular flow field around the horizontal tubes of a moving bed heat exchanger. The simulation results are compared to measurement data using particle image velocimetry (PINT). In the upper part of the tube the model agrees well with the experiment, capturing the relevant flow phenomena like the stagnant zone on top of the tube. Below the tube, a void area is observed both in the experiment and the simulation. However, the PIV analysis of the experimental data doesn't resolve the void area and the associated flow phenomena due to the highly dynamic flow state, the inherent nature of Ply technique and additional disturbing effects in the setup. Therefore, the model can't be validated in the corresponding regions. Still, the deviations between simulation and experiment are confined to a very narrow region directly at the tube surface in the lower part of the tube. In the rest of the flow field, the model proves to be a reliable tool for further investigations and will be used in future studies."
1186,I,"Thermal energy storage (TES) systems are key components of concentrating solar power plants in order to offer energy dispatchability to adapt the electricity power production to the curve demand. Nitrate molten salts are the storage media used today in concentrated solar power plants. They are also used as heat transfer fluid (HTF) in the molten salt tower (MST) technology. Traditional MST plants work in the temperature range of 240-565 degrees C using the so-called solar salt, a mixture of 60-40 wt% of NaNO3 and KNO3. This study wants to optimize the thermal energy storage cost of the solar concentration technology by analysing different mixtures of solar salts, using different percentages of NaNO3 and KNO3 in the mixture. The new mixtures seek a reduction in the cost of the storage material while optimizing its physical and chemical properties. The study shows how an increase in the proportion of sodium nitrate for a new binary solar salt to 78-22 wt%, produces an increase in the heat capacity of the mixture by reducing the necessary inventory of salts in the system. However, the new salt presents an increase in the melting point, going from 240 degrees C to 279 degrees C, which makes the operation of the system difficult. The impact on the cost of this optimization in the performance of a commercial plant was analysed. The plant chosen to evaluate the impact is a tower technology plant with 85 MWe power and 13 h of storage. The study shows a LCOE reduction of up to 0.6% for the new mixture with higher sodium nitrate."
1187,I,"In this study, an assessment of salinity gradient stability of an industrial solar pond during two operation seasons (2014 and 2105) is presented. An industrial solar pond was constructed to supply a low-temperature heat (up to 60 degrees C) to achieve the temperature requirements of the flotation stage in a mineral processing plant (Solvay Minerales in Granada (Spain)). Along the first season, the salinity gradient was considered technically destroyed in April 2015 as the height to the upper convective zone increases from 0.3 m in July 2014 to 0.8 m. Two different methodologies based on the stratification principle were adapted and used in order to evaluate the salinity gradient stability. The boundaries of the salinity gradient appeared as the main source of instability. In the upper zone it is associated with the environmental parameters (e.g., rain and wind) that affect the upper convective zone and the upper layers of the non-convective zone that subsequently transmit the instability to the lower layers. In the bottom zone it is caused by operation parameters, such as the heat extraction or the addition of salt. Both methodologies provided similar predictive capability of stability results. However, the results provided by the stability analysis using the thermal and salinity expansion coefficients are a more useful tool in the control of the salinity gradient for solar pond technology."
1188,I,"A novel, low-cost linear Fresnel collector for concentrating solar power applications is being developed by Hyperlight Energy (Hyperlight) and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). Hyperlight is currently deploying their linear Fresnel collector technology in a half-acre pilot loop near Brawley, California. The optical performance of a concentrating solar power collector represents the largest loss in the efficiency of the overall system. The ability to accurately model the complex optical interactions of a collector becomes essential in successfully implementing a new collector technology. This study presents a detailed sensitivity analysis of the optical performance of Hyperlight linear Fresnel technology, characterizing the effects of potential optomechanical error sources on collector performance. Optical models are implemented in SolTrace, a Monte-Carlo ray-tracing software developed at NREL. First, SolTrace is used to analyze collector sensitivity to individual optomechanical error perturbations in both the primary reflectors and the receiver assembly. Then, a high-fidelity optomechanical error model is adopted to capture the realistic performance of the installed Hyperlight linear Fresnel collector. The sensitivity analysis can provide insightful guidance to inform the tightening and relaxation of tolerances during manufacturing and implementation of a new collector technology."
1189,I,"The reduction of copper (II) oxide was carried out under concentrated solar radiation in a stream of gaseous mixture 5/95 v/v H-2/N-2 in a 1.5 kW thermal power vertical axis parabolic concentrator at the PROMES-CNRS solar facility (Odeillo-Font Romeu, France). Experiments were performed using a commercial oxide in two different forms, powdered and compacted specimens. The reduction of CuO to elemental Cu was more effective for compacted specimen yielding a dendrite microstructured metallic copper with an electrochemical behavior similar to that exhibited by the commercial metal. In the case of powdered specimen, a composite metal/oxide (Cu/Cu2O block was obtained as a macroporous material. The reduction process of CuO under concentrated solar energy tracks through the formation of Cu2O as the only intermediate phase, which was evidenced by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy."
1190,I,"The extent to which a solar-reflective """"cool"""" wall can reduce a building's cooling load in summer or increase its heating load in winter scales with the wall's incident solar radiation, or solar availability. We assess how the solar availability at the wall of a central (modeled) building is affected by a neighboring wall across an urban canyon by calculating the central wall's solar availability factor (SAF), defined as the ratio of sunlight incident on the central wall in the presence of the neighboring wall to that incident in the absence of the neighboring wall. Cool-wall heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) energy savings simulated for an isolated central building (no neighbors) can be multiplied by SAFs to account for interactions with neighboring walls. Monthly values of SAF were evaluated in 17 climates across the United States, including three in California, for north, east, south, and west central walls, over a wide range of canyon aspect ratio (height/width). Results for four representative aspect ratios-0.2, 1, 2, and 10 are presented. In Fresno, CA, monthly SAF ranges from 0.90 to 0.96 for central walls facing north, east, south, or west when the aspect ratio is 0.2 (two-story single-family homes across a street) and both the central and neighboring walls are conventional (albedo 0.25). Monthly SAFs decrease as aspect ratio rises, falling to 0.06-0.24 at an aspect ratio of 10 (adjacent 10-story buildings on the same side of the street). An example worked for a two-story single-family home in Fresno on the west side of a residential street yields SAFs of 0.47 (north), 0.92 (east), 0.50 (south), and 0.63 (west) to apply to the cool-wall annual HVAC energy savings computed for an isolated central building. Shading and reflection reduce the home's annual HVAC energy cost savings by 31%."
1191,I,"The aim of this work is to propose a fast and easily implementable model allowing the consideration of inter-row shading in the simulation of the power production of PV plants. Our objective is to find the simplest model with the least number of input parameters. A formulation of the shaded fraction of the module area dependent on the PV configuration and the sun position is first proposed. An analysis of the measurements of two plants is then carried out to understand the effect of inter-row shading for a complete PV array. Based on this analysis, a model is proposed and validated. It is shown that the consideration of inter-row shading with the proposed model allows a relative improvement of the simulation accuracy (RMSE) ranging between 18 and 32% for time steps affected by inter-row shading and between 7 and 12% for a complete year."
1192,I,"On the basis of density functional calculations and using Bader's atom in molecule theory, this article presents quantitative microscopic analyses on the bonding properties of amorphous silicon (a-Si) which could reflect in the observable mechanical and electronic behaviors of this material. In addition, the occurrence and strength of quantum confinement of charge carriers in a composition of silicon crystal nano slabs (SiNSs) embedded in hydrogenated a-Si (a-Si:H) semiconductor are studied. It is shown that the strongest confinement effect happens for Si slabs limited in [10 0] direction. The band gap tunability with the width of SiNSs is exhibited and a scaling law is investigated for the size dependent behavior of energy states. It is demonstrated and argued why in these systems the confinement of holes is stronger than electron confinement. The computational methodology used to passivate a-Si defects by hydrogen is also detailed."
1193,I,"Transparent Insulation (TI) systems are regarded as one of the most promising technologies for providing thermal insulation along with transmission of solar energy. TI systems have a wide range of applications in energy conservation and harnessing solar energy. This paper provides an overview of TI systems and TI materials (TIM), by characterising TI systems on the basis of geometry, material used and general heat losses in these geometrical layouts. Evolution of TI applications is presented with the introduction of new materials. Two new types of TIM (polypropylene and cellulose acetate) are reported in this paper in contrast to previous reviews on TIM. A systematic survey of past literature was carried out to present latest research works and development on TI geometrical layouts and applications. An explicit study of TIM and TI system manufacturers has been carried out to show existing trends in TI applications and geometry. In the last decade, aerogels are most frequently used as TIM for providing insulation and daylighting in buildings. It is concluded that in existing TIM technologies, TI systems incorporating aerogel have the lowest thermal transmittance (U-value) and better solar transmittance (g-value) at lower thickness compared with TI systems incorporating other types of TIM. This paper highlights the availability of TIM geometry with desirable applications and TI systems for energy conservation."
1194,I,"Commercial solar plants produce energy around a nominal operating point in which the solar field outlet temperature is high and close to the thermal limit of the heat transfer fluid. The main control of the temperature is carried out by means of the fluid flow-rate that circulates through the solar field. Defocusing the collectors is normally used as a safety mechanism to avoid exceeding the thermal limit. However, in situations in which the flow is saturated, the control of defocusing the collectors becomes of vital importance and is the system in charge of controlling the solar field outlet temperature. The paper presents an Adaptive State Space Model Predictive Control strategy with an incremental formulation to control the fourth and third collector defocus angles for field outlet temperature set-point tracking at the nominal operation point, avoiding the Heat Transfer Fluid temperature from exceeding the manufacturer thermal limit (oil degradation). The state space description uses an Unscented Kalman Filter for estimating the non-measurable states. A 50 MW parabolic solar trough plant nonlinear model has been used to design and validate the strategy. Simulation results are presented showing the advantages of using the proposed strategy."
1195,I,"Building core sunlighting systems (BCSS) are developed to deliver daylight where it can not be delivered by the conventional methods. A brief history is given of researches and developments into the BCSS over the last fifty years, in addition to a short description of the technologies and components of eighteen fully developed or commercialized systems. The paper classifies and compares the BCSS according to their design approaches so as to conclude the common features of the successful systems. Eight lessons learned have been addressed. The BCSS are technically powerful enough to provide lighting for remote and windowless spaces within buildings, but a couple of significant shortcomings hinders their popularization: cost prohibitive and application limitations. In addition, components costs/performance efficiency trade-off is one of the most fundamental decisions the BCSS designer must make. Finally, the paper presents the most recent design approaches that have been developed to overcome the identified failings."
1196,I,"In this study, we synthesized and characterized particles with a stearic acid (SA) core encapsulated in poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and four PMMA-hybrid shell materials. The objective was to create spherical particles with diameters of several hundred nanometers for use as the dispersed phase in thermotropic materials for overheat protection of polymer solar absorbers. Encapsulation was accomplished by emulsion polymerization. The composition, morphology and thermal properties of the encapsulated particles were characterized by scanning and transmission microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectral analysis, digital scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetry. There were no chemical interactions between core and shell materials. The mean dia. meter and the thickness of the encapsulating shell varied over relatively narrow ranges of 110-360 nm, and 17-60 nm, respectively, depending on the functional groups of the shell. Based on published recommendations for size and shell thickness for thermotropic materials for overheat protection of polymer solar absorbers, particles encapsulated with polymethylmethacrylate-co-2-hydroxy-ethylacrylate (PMMA-HEA) shell and with polymethylmethacrylate-styrene (PMMA-S) shell are good candidates for further evaluation."
1197,I,"An important step during a project of a heat pump system is choosing a more suitable refrigerant. This paper presents a comparative study among refrigerants for a small direct expansion solar assisted heat pump (DX-SAHP). The mathematical model used in this study is presented in detail and validated from an experimental setup. The R134a is the reference and the refrigerants with low GWP are R290, R600a, R744 and R1234yf. The results show that R290 has better COP than others refrigerants for solar radiation between 300 W/m(2) and 700 W/m(2), as well as for environment temperature between 10 degrees C and 35 degrees C. On the other hand, for solar radiation less than 50 W/m(2), the R134a has better COP than R290. TEWI (Total Equivalent Warming Impact) analysis indicates that the indirect emission is the most important effect, and then, the TEWI results almost followed the COP outcome. A parametric analysis was conducted to evaluate the influence of the CO2 emission factor for producing electricity. In countries with higher emission factor, the refrigerant with the best COP has the best TEWI. The influence of wind speed and ambient temperature in COP of a DX-SAHP using R290 were more relevant in low solar radiation."
1198,I,"Cloud base height (CBH) is an important parameter for physics-based high resolution solar radiation modeling. In sky imager-based forecasts, a ceilometer or stereographic setup is needed to derive the CBH; otherwise erroneous CBHs lead to incorrect physical cloud velocity and incorrect projection of cloud shadows, causing solar power forecast errors due to incorrect shadow positions and timing of shadowing events. In this paper, two methods to estimate cloud base height from a single sky imager and distributed ground solar irradiance measurements are proposed. The first method (Time Series Correlation, denoted as """"TSC"""") is based upon the correlation between ground-observed global horizontal irradiance (GHI) time series and a modeled GHI time series generated from a sequence of sky images geo-rectified to a candidate set of CBH. The estimated CBH is taken as the candidate that produces the highest correlation coefficient. The second method (Geometric Cloud Shadow Edge, denoted as """"GCSE"""") integrates a numerical ramp detection method for ground-observed GHI time series with solar and cloud geometry applied to cloud edges in a sky image. CBH are benchmarked against a collocated ceilometer and stereographically estimated CBH from two sky imagers for 15 min median-filtered CBHs. Over 30 days covering all seasons, the TSC method performs similarly to the GCSE method with nRMSD of 18.9% versus 20.8%. A key limitation of both proposed methods is the requirement of sufficient variation in GHI to enable reliable correlation and ramp detection. The advantage of the two proposed methods is that they can be applied when measurements from only a single sky imager and pyranometers are available."
1199,I,"By using electrical characterization and classical solid state semiconductor device theory, we demonstrate that the open circuit voltage (V-oc) in organic solar cells based on non-intentional doped semiconductors is fundamentally limited by the built-in potential (V-bi) originated at a donor-acceptor abrupt (p-n(++)) heterojunction in case of selective contacts. Our analysis is validated using P3HT:PCBM devices fabricated in our research group. We also demonstrate that such a result can be generalized using data already reported in literature for fullerenebased solar cells. Finally, we show that the dependence of V-oc on the device contacts can be understood in terms of the potential barriers formed by the Fermi level alignment of semiconductors at the heterojunction and at the Schottky junctions."
1200,I,"Direct expansion solar assisted PVT (photovoltaic/thermal) heat pump is a combination of PVT technology and heat pump technology, which can improve the comprehensive conversion efficiency of solar energy, and it is suitable for solar heating applications. In this paper, the efficiency factor of direct expansion PVT module employing roll-bond panel has been theoretically derived, modified, and validated by experimental results. Moreover, the efficiency factor could be used to design, evaluate, and optimize the thermal performance of direct expansion solar assisted heat pump systems. In addition, parameter analysis of four evaporator unit types has been conducted, and the recommendation values of each parameter have also been presented. The simulation results show that the roll-bond evaporator (fluid channel width: 10 mm) with hexagon and rectangle patterns have better temperature distribution uniformity than grid and linear types, and their temperature differences are both 0.038 degrees C while their dimensionless pressure losses are 0.109 and 0.230, respectively. To specifically design different kinds of PVT collector/evaporator or direct expansion evaporators, a novel design method for roll-bond evaporator is proposed, and a combination of hexagon and grid types is recommended for PVT module. Moreover, the recommendation fluid channel width of the roll-bond panel is 8 mm to 13 mm while the scaling ratio is 0.8 to 1.2. The modified efficiency factors are 0.521, 0.564, 0.549, and 0.342 of hexagon, grid, rectangle, and linear types when the fluid channel width is 10 mm, respectively."
1201,I,"Albedo (solar reflectance) can be measured outdoors with a pyranometer or indoors with a hemispherical reflectometer or a spectrophotometer. The current study evaluates these methods and their applicability to roofing materials by measuring and comparing the ASTM E1918 (pyranometer), non-ASTM E1918A (alternative pyranometer), ASTM C1549 (reflectometer), and E903 (spectrophotometer) albedos of 10 roofing products, including three single-ply membranes, one asphalt shingle, three roofing aggregates, and three high-profile tiles. It uses full-size (4 m x 4 m) assemblies in the E1918 and E1918A trials; corrects the E1918 albedos to remove shadow and background errors; and evaluates C1549 and E903 albedos with two different irradiance spectra, one global horizontal and the other beam normal. E1918A albedos matched E1918 corrected (E1918_cor) albedos to within 0.036. Agreement between C1549 air mass 1 global horizontal (C1549_G1) albedo and E1918_cor albedo was within 0.015 for membrane and shingle coupons, and within 0.031 for aggregates, though the uncertainty in the latter agreement was up to 0.043. After minor corrections, C1549_G1 albedos of flat or slightly convex tile chips were 0.032-0.052 higher than the E1918_cor albedos of their corresponding high-profile tile assemblies because high-profile surfaces have concavities. Switching to the beam-normal albedo C1549_1.5E increased the C1549 albedos of the 10 tested products by 0.004-0.054, with the largest increases (C1549_1.5E - C1549_G1) accruing to spectrally selective cool colors. Using C1549_1.5E albedo to characterize a chip of a cool-colored tile compounded the error induced by representing a high-profile surface by a flat or slightly convex specimen."
1202,I,"Characterizing short-term variability of generated solar power is important for the integration of photovoltaic (PV) systems into the electrical grid. Using different kinds of high frequency, in-situ observations of both irradiance and generated PV power, we quantify insights on temporal averaging effects on the highest observed peaks and ramp rates, which closely relate to grid stability. We use measurements obtained at three specific spatial scales; a single point pyranometer, two household PV systems and a PV system typical for small medium businesses. We show that the 15-minute time resolution typically used for grid calculations significantly underestimates key dynamics at high temporal resolutions, such as ramp rates and maximum power output, at the local grid level. We find that absolute power peaks in the order of seconds are up to 18% higher compared to a 15-minute resolution for irradiance and up to 22% higher for a household PV system. For the largest PV system, the increase is limited to 11%. Furthermore, we find that the highest peaks solely occur under mixed-cloud conditions. Additionally, we show that the time interval-dependency of the largest power ramps is similar for all systems under research, ranging from similar to 20% at a 5-second interval to stabilizing at 70-80% between 5 and 10 min, which we can explain based on meteorological arguments."
1203,I,"Use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling for solar reactor design optimization is a powerful tool in developing efficient reactors for solar thermochemical applications. CFD models can capture complex multiphase flow dynamics to explain the physics linking the heat transfer and flow dynamics on chemical conversion efficiency and continuous operation of a solar reactor. Flux map and temperature data can be numerically obtained via CFD inside the solar reactor, which is a harsh environment for penetrating measurement tools. In this paper, a CFD analysis of a solar cavity receiver operated with air flow and is directly irradiated by a 10 kW(e) High Flux Solar Simulator (HFSS) is presented. Radiative heat transfer from the HFSS is modeled by implementing Monte Carlo Ray Tracing (MCRT) for tracking the ray paths from the radiative source to the aperture plane of the receiver. Flux densities were computed at the aperture and validated by experimental heat flux characterization of the solar simulator. The validated MCRT model provided directional information on the radiative flux and was sequentially coupled to the computational fluid domain. Through experimental testing, receiver temperatures up to 1200 K were measured with solar input at the entrance of the cavity of around 3 kW radiative power. Experimentally measured non-uniform temperature distribution in the axial direction was recorded, which developed a hot spot at the backplate of the cavity. Accuracy of the numerical model was validated by comparing the temperature prediction inside the cavity receiver to experimental results. Validated model was then used to conduct a parametric study on the flow configuration to identify run conditions yielding enhanced fluid mixing and improved heat transfer characteristics. The results showed that altering the angle of the main inlet ports proved to be effective in reducing the local hot spot in the back of the receiver. Moreover, results of the parametric study identified the increase of main flow rate as a positive contribution towards temperature uniformity throughout the fluid domain."
1204,I,"A single ring-array concentrator solar furnace unit was firstly modeled analytically, and then optimized numerically by ZEMAX (R) and ANSYS (R) software, reaching a temperature of 3778 K, nearly equivalent to that of a medium size solar furnace with 3.14 m(2) collection area. A novel three-dimensional ring array concentrator solar furnace was subsequently proposed and analyzed. It consisted of five single ring array concentrators, forming a compact box-shaped solar furnace with an opening at the rear side for an easy access to a common focal spot in the center. Based on the edge-ray principle of non-imaging optics, 30,960 solar concentration ratio was analytically calculated for this solar furnace, leading to significantly enhanced thermal and optical efficiencies. The temperature performance of the three-dimensional ring-array concentrator furnace as a function of receiver size and collector area was analyzed numerically and compared to that of the medium size solar furnace. For a 5.68 mm diameter spherical receiver and large collection area varying from 3.14 m(2) to 100 m(2), 1.1 times gradual enhancement in the maximum attainable temperature was calculated for the ring array concentrator furnace. More importantly, its average and minimum temperatures were significantly improved by 870 K and 1140 K, respectively, as compared to that of the medium size solar furnace. In addition, the three-dimensional ring-array concentrator also presented a significant tracking error compensation capacity in relation to that with the medium size solar furnace."
1205,I,"Integration of photovoltaics (PV) with electrical energy storage (battery) is a straightforward approach to turn intermittent power source into stable power supply. Power coupling, or power matching, between PV-device, a battery, and a load is most frequently performed with aid of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) electronics. MPPT electronics provides high flexibility as for PV and load impedances, and irradiance, however, it brings in additional cost, and complexity, power overhead, potential reliability issues, and interference signals. On the other hand, direct coupling via preselection of PV and battery parameters is a simple scalable and highly efficient alternative to MPPT for a specific set of conditions. We explore with modeling how far a directly coupled PV-battery unit can stay power-matched under various conditions, and demonstrate feasibility of excellent power matching over orders of magnitude of irradiance and a wide range of load resistances. Both a PV-harvester in an office room with low irradiance, non-demanding load, and high autonomy, and a PV-system on a roof with high irradiance, demanding load, and partial autonomy, can operate efficiently without MPPT electronics if an appropriate battery is included. This result emphasizes the role of a battery as an impedance matching element besides storage functionality in a directly matched PV-system."
1206,I,"Cu2ZnSn1-xGexSe4 (CZTGSe) thin films have been grown onto Mo/SLG and Mo/V2O5/FTO/SLG substrates using thermal co-evaporation followed by a subsequent thermal annealing. A NaF precursor layer was evaporated prior to the deposition of the kesterite absorber layer. In the samples grown on Mo/SLG, it has been found that Na promotes Ge incorporation into the Cu2ZnSnSe4 lattice. The high concentration of incorporated Ge leads to the segregation of Sn-Se secondar y phases as we l l as to an accumulation of Sn next to the Mo layer. The use of 12 and 16 nm NaF thick precursor layers prior to the CZTGSe deposition leads to absorber band gaps of 1.30 and 1.34 eV, and to device performances of 4.7 and 4.0%, respectively. A higher Na content, furthermore, caused the formation of bigger grains, a higher charge carrier concentration and a shorter depletion width. A 12 nm NaF precursor layer was used for the devices grown on FTO-based substrates, producing an optimal back contact that allows achieving efficiencies of 5.6% and transmittance of 30% in the near infrared range. This enhanced performance can be associated with the absence of secondary phases and Ge distribution through the absorber layer. The formation of a MoSe2 layer at the back interface in al l the investigated devices seems to play a crucial role to improve the solar cell efficiency."
1207,I,"Building Integrated Photovoltaic Thermal (BIPV/T) systems which generate electricity and heat simultaneously are promising solutions for Net Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB). Despite BIPV/T offering clear energetic and space saving advantages compared to separate PV and solar thermal, overheating problems occur when no thermal demand exists, resulting in reduced yields, stagnation damage, and excessive fluid flow pressures. This two-part study examines an alternative approach combining BIPV, Planar Liquid-Vapour Thermal Diodes (PLVTD) and Integrated Collector-Storage Solar Water Heaters (ICSSWH) to achieve BIPV/T functionality and retain heat overnight to minimises parasitic demands and reduce overheating. The introductory paper (Part 1 of 2) established novelty and rationale for BIPV-PLVTD-ICSSWH concepts, reviewed state-of-the-art and performance benchmarks, and used theoretical modelling to predict behaviour from key design and operational parameters. This paper (Part 2 of 2) describes prototype realisation and multi-day solar simulator laboratory thermal and photovoltaic testing for covered and uncovered variants exposed to different irradiance levels. Measured solar thermal efficiencies with and without transparent covers were eta(T,col) = 60% and 58% respectively under zero heat loss conditions whilst overnight heat loss coefficients were U-r,U-sysAsys/u = 23.0 and 25.4 W.m(-3) K-1 respectively, showing good agreement with theoretical predictions. Photovoltaic performance reduced with increasing absorber temperature as expected, although maximum power point efficiencies (eta(E,mpp) = 11.4% at T-1 approximate to 25 degrees C and 5.6% at T-1 approximate to 89 degrees C, without cover) were lower than expected owing to partial delamination and PV cell damage. The work demonstrates practical operation of a vertical BIPV-PLVTD-ICSSWH, identifies key areas for design development, and highlights benefits of application in NZEB facades."
1208,I,"This work presents the validation of a heuristic model, which predicts the electrical characteristics of CIGSSe thin film solar modules. This model is based on four-coefficient equations, used to determine electrical parameters from photovoltaic devices such as open circuit voltage, short circuit current, current at maximum power point and maximum power point. The coefficients are obtained numerically by fitting these equations to measured datasets related to various irradiances and module temperatures. These four coefficients or predictors per parameter can then be used to calculate a parameter at different conditions. The datasets employed in this work were obtained from thin film CIGSSe modules, measured under both controlled laboratory and operating outdoor conditions. The validation of the model is performed by comparing the presented approach to well-known established models and methods for module power rating including the international standards IEC and SAPM. The comparison is performed using statistical analysis, comparing the deviation between the predicted and the measured output power. Furthermore, the possibility of evaluating the temperature coefficients through this model is also explored. The proposed model has been applied and validated yielding high correlation co-efficients for CIGSSe modules for energy rating, power output forecasting and temperature coefficient calculation."
1209,I,"Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems generate electricity with no marginal costs or emissions. As a result, PV output is almost always prioritized over other fuel sources and delivered to the electric grid. However, PV curtailment is increasing as PV composes greater shares of grid capacity. In this paper, we present a novel synthesis of curtailment in four key countries: Chile, China, Germany, and the United States. We find that about 6.5 million MWh of PV output was curtailed in these countries in 2018. We find that: Policy and grid planning practices influence where, when, and how much PV is curtailed; Some PV curtailment is attributable to limited transmission capacity connecting remote solar resources to load centers; PV curtailment peaks in the spring and fall, when PV output is relatively high but electricity demand is relatively low. We discuss available measures to reduce PV curtailment as well as increasing PV curtailment in the contexts of evolving grids and energy technologies."
1210,I,"The efficient and productive operation of a Concentrating Solar Thermal (CST) plant depends upon knowledge of the mean reflectance of the solar collector field, as the levelized cost of electricity has a one-to-one ratio with reflector optical performance. Considering the size of such collector fields, a continuous detailed survey of the whole field is not a practical proposition. This paper presents a statistical approach to measuring mean field reflectance by sampling only a subset of the field reflectors. We find that three samples are sufficient for evaluating the mean reflectance of a single facet, and that the locations sampled within the facet do not impact the estimate of the mean. Further, for any collection of facets behaving as a cluster, again sampling three facets is sufficient to yield an estimate of the mean reflectance of the cluster. These sample numbers hold for an error of 2.5% at 95% confidence; different error or confidence intervals will affect the sample numbers required. The results are obtained from studying the behavior of both a heliostat and a linear Fresnel collector field. A blueprint for large CST collector fields is derived."
1211,I,"Horizontal light pipes (HLP) have shown the potential to convey daylight deeper into buildings. The wide variation in incident angles of sunlight rays and the resulting numerous interreflections of light rays within the pipe are the main reasons for the limited light transmittance of such light pipes during certain daylight periods. This paper presents a research study on different configurations of acrylic laser-cut panels (LCP) applied at the entrance of horizontal pipes as light collectors to increase the transmittance of HLPs and improve daylight autonomy in spaces equipped with HLPs. This study required the development of a suitable methodology. The study begins with an experimental laboratory test of a HLP scale model to determine the light transmittance efficiency (standard daylight guide characteristic) of HLPs with several LCP configurations. The results from the laboratory test are combined with the statistical data for both the direct and diffuse illuminance on the vertical south oriented surface (Satel-Light database) for the location selected for the analyses (Oslo, Norway). The analyses are discussed via the application of a theoretical model of an office space equipped with a HPL as well as through the concept of daylight autonomy (DA) in an indoor space. The paper shows that a certain static LCP configuration has the potential to increase DA100 and DA300 to 10% and 19%, respectively, at a 2.1 m distance from the facade, and 8.75% and 16%, respectively, at a 4.5 m distance. This paper also contributes to lighting science with its data on the light transmittance efficiency of each LCP configuration, which can be applicable in further research."
1212,I,"Electricity access in Africa is a major challenge in rural areas. Despite considerable potential for the use of solar energy, investments in renewable energy projects are minimal due to poor promotion of solar energy. As a result, many people still rely on private diesel generators, which release significant levels of pollutants, and have negative effects on both humans and the environment. Situated in the sunbelt, Sudan is one of the largest countries in Africa endowed with an extremely high solar irradiation potential. However, no work has been done in the literature with a strategic context to study specifically the feasibility of renewable energy systems in Sudan despite the abundance of solar resource. The aim of this study was to utilize Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables (HOMER) to identify the optimal solar photovoltaic (PV) system for Sudan's conditions, identify the best locations, and analyze the costs and the pollution that might be avoided by employing a PV system in place of a diesel system. HOMER simulation results demonstrated that the optimal type of PV for Sudan is the Studer VarioTrack VT-65 with Generic PV. The utilization of a solar PV system will avoid the production of approximately 27 million kg/year of pollutants and will reduce the cost of energy to USD$ 0.08746/kWh. The optimal locations found in Sudan for utilizing solar energy were Wawa, followed by Kutum, Wadi Halfa, Dongola and Al-Goled due to their low costs of electricity, high clearness index and high levels of solar radiation. Given the recent rapid decrease in PV pricing and predictions for continued reductions, the costs of PV were varied to deliver an understanding on the impact of PV costs on the project economics. Reducing the PV costs by 25% has a significant impact; the cost of energy produced reduces in the range of USD$ 0.06697/kWh and USD$ 0.06808/kWh, while a reduction in PV costs of 50% further reduces the cost of energy, ranging between USD$ 0.05273/kWh and USD$ 0.05361/kWh in the top five locations in Sudan. The output of this study is projected to raising the potentiality awareness of renewable energy in Sudan and delivering a valuable reference regarding the optimal utilization of solar PV system in energy sector."
1213,I,"The tracking of heliostats with arbitrary orientation of the primary and secondary axes is considered, and the explicit formulas are derived to find the tracking angles for a given position of the sun. It is shown that the inverse kinematics problem leads to a quadratic equation and has two solutions in general case. The solutions can be obtained in vector, matrix or quaternionic form. The advantages of the particular forms and possible applications are discussed. The corrections due to offset between tracking axes and mirror facets are also considered. The paper is accompanied with a Python library, which shows how to implement the tracking algorithms, and an interactive Jupyter notebook."

Here we present a design composed of a highly selective solar thermal absorber coating that has been deposited by DC magnetron sputtering. This will consist of four layers: W/AlSiTiNx/SiAlTiOyNx/SiAlOx. The coating that was utilised revealed an excellent average solar thermal absorbance, (alpha = 95.5%) with very low emittance, (epsilon = 9.6% calculated for 500 degrees C) together with an excellent thermal stability after annealed at 500 degrees C, in air for 350 h, and at 630 degrees C in vacuum for 220 h."
1215,I,"This paper focuses on the development of 2-terminal CIGS-perovskite tandem solar cells by exploring a range of stack sequences and synthetic procedures for depositing the associated layers. In the end, we converged at a stack sequence composed of SLG/Mo/CIGS/CdS/i-ZnO/ZnO:Al/NiO/PTAA/Perovskite/LiF/PCBM/SnO2/ITO. With this architecture, we reached performances only about 1% lower than the corresponding 4-terminal tandem cells, thus demonstrating functional interconnects between the two sub-cells while grown monolithically on top of each other. We go through the stack, layer-by-layer, discussing their deposition and the results, from which we can conclude what works, what does not work, and what potentially could work after additional modifications. The challenges for a successful 2-terminal tandem device include: how to deal with, or decrease, the surface roughness of the CIGS-stack, how to obtain uniform coverage of the layers between the CIGS and the perovskite while also obtaining a benign interface chemistry, and how to tune the band gaps of both the CIGS and the perovskite to obtain good optical matching. The investigation was based on CIGS with a power conversion efficiency around 14%, and perovskites with an efficiency around 12%, resulting in 2-terminal tandem cells with efficiencies of 15-16%. The results indicate that by using higher performing CIGS and perovskite sub-cells, it should be possible to manufacture highly efficient 2-terminal CIGS-perovskite tandem devices by using the protocols, principles, and procedures developed and discussed in this paper."
1216,I,"In this paper, the soiling impact on photovoltaic systems in Aguascalientes, in central Mexico, an area where 1.4GWp of new photovoltaic capacity is being installed, is characterised experimentally. A soiling rate of -0.16%/day in the dry season for optimally tilted crystalline silicon modules, and a stabilization of the soiling losses at 11.2% after 70 days of exposure were observed. With these data, a first of its kind novel method for determining optimum cleaning schedules is proposed based on minimising the levelised cost of energy. The method has the advantages compared to other existing methods of considering the system investment cost in the determination of the optimum cleaning schedule. Also, it does not depend on economic revenue data, which are often subject to uncertainty. The results show that residential and commercial systems should be cleaned once per year in Aguascalientes. On the other hand, cleaning intervals from 12 to 31 days in the dry season were estimated for utility-scale systems, due to the dramatic decrease of cleaning costs per unit photovoltaic capacity. We also present a comparative analysis of the existing criteria for optimising cleaning schedules applied to the same case study. The different methods give similar cleaning intervals for utility-scale systems and, thus, the choice of a suitable method depends on the availability of information."

Using the modularly designed organocatalysts (MDOs) self-assembled from cinchona alkaloid derivatives and amino acids in the reaction media, the title products were obtained in good to high yields (up to 97%) and excellent diastereoselectivities (up to 99:1 dr) and enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee)."

1221,J,"We report the first use of renewable, bio-based, non-hazardous feedstock methyl coumalate (MC) in organocatalyzed Morita-Baylis-Hillman (MBH) reactions. This atom-economical pathway employs inexpensive Et3N as a catalyst in ethanol. Synthon MC efficiently constructs C-C bonds with various imines and aldehydes in moderate to good yields. This catalytic process is triggered via an unprecedented 1,6-conjugated addition, as opposed to the classical MBH reaction. Moreover, this methodology expands Morita-Baylis-Hillman donor capabilities to a 2-pyrone derivative for the first time.

1223,J,"In this study, a small library of twenty benzo[g] isoquinoline-5,10-diones were synthesized in a novel straightforward approach, starting from 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (vitamin K). An intramolecular Heck reaction of a N-vinylacetamide was a crucial step in the synthetic route, at which the combination of cesium carbonate and a bulky, electron rich trialkylphosphine ((BuCy2P)-Bu-t center dot HBF4) provided high 6-endotrig selectivity. The anti-tubercular activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra and acute cytotoxicity against J774 A. 1 macrophages were studied. From the structure activity relationship, it could be derived that in general the substitution of position 3 yielded analogs with a higher antitubercular potency. Among these, two analogs, 27a and 27b, showed remarkable activity with minimal inhibition concentrations of respectively 28.92 mu M and 1.05 mu M, and acute cytotoxic concentrations of > 128 mu M and 34.85 mu M. In addition, the analogs and their possible metabolites were evaluated using a Vitotox (TM) assay to study the possibility of genotoxicity. Results indicated that none of the evaluated analogs and their possible metabolites showed early signs of genotoxicity."
1224,J,"The C-terminal domain of the dehydrophos biosynthetic enzyme DhpH (DhpH-C) catalyzes the condensation of Leu-tRNA(Leu) with (R)-1-aminoethylphosphonate, the aminophosphonate analog of alanine called Ala(P). The product of this reaction, Leu-Ala(P), is a phosphonodipeptide, a class of compounds that have previously been investigated for use as clinical antibiotics. In this study, we show that DhpH-C is highly substrate tolerant and can condense various aminophosphonates (Gly(P), Ser(P), Val(P), 1-aminopropylphosphonate, and phenylglycine(P)) to Leu. Moreover, the enzyme is also tolerant with respect to the amino acid attached to tRNA(Leu). Using a mutant of leucyl tRNA synthetase that is deficient in its proofreading ability allowed the preparation of a series of aminoacyl-tRNALeu derivatives (Ile, Ala, Val, Met, norvaline, and norleucine). DhpH-C accepted these aminoacyl-tRNA(Leu) derivatives and condensed the amino acid with L-Ala(P) to form the corresponding phosphonodipeptides. A subset of these peptides displayed antimicrobial activities demonstrating that the enzyme is a versatile biocatalyst for the preparation of antimicrobial peptides. We also investigated another enzyme from the dehydrophos biosynthetic pathway, the 2-oxoglutarate dependent enzyme DhpA. This enzyme oxidizes 2-hydroxyethylphosphonate to 1,2-dihydroxyethylphosphonate en route to L-Ala(P), but longer incubation results in overoxidation to 1-oxo-2-hydroxyethylphosphonate. This alpha-ketophosphonate was converted by the pyridoxal phosphate dependent enzyme DhpD into L-Ser(P). Thus, the dehydrophos biosynthetic enzymes can generate not only L-Ala(P) but also L-Ser(P)."
1225,J,"Small molecules that can interrupt or inhibit protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are valuable as probes in chemical biology and medicinal chemistry, but they are also notoriously difficult to develop. Design of non-peptidic small molecules that mimic amino acid side-chain interactions in PPIs (""""minimalist mimics"""") is seen as a way to fast track discovery of PPI inhibitors. However, there has been little comment on general design criteria for minimalist mimics, even though such guidelines could steer construction of libraries to screen against multiple PPI targets. We hypothesized insight into general design criteria for minimalist mimics could be gained by comparing preferred conformations of typical minimalist mimic designs against side-chain orientations on a huge number of PPI interfaces. That thought led to this work which features nine minimalist mimic designs: one from the literature, and eight new """"hypothetical"""" ones conceived by us. Simulated preferred conformers of these were systematically aligned with > 240 000 PPI interfaces from the Protein Data Bank. Conclusions from those analyses did indeed reveal various design considerations that are discussed here. Surprisingly, this study also showed one of the minimalist mimic designs aligned on PPI interface segments more than 15 times more frequently than any other in the series (according to uniform standards described herein); reasons for this are also discussed."
1226,J,"The formation of a novel trichain (TC) lipid was discovered when a cationic lipid possessing a terminal hydroxyl group and the helper lipid dioleoyl L-a-phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) were formulated as vesicles and stored. Importantly, the transfection efficacies of lipopolyplexes comprised of the TC lipid, a targeting peptide and DNA (LPDs) were found to be higher than when the corresponding dichain (DC) lipid was used. To explore this interesting discovery and determine if this concept can be more generally applied to improve gene delivery efficiencies, the design and synthesis of a series of novel TC cationic lipids and the corresponding DC lipids was undertaken. Transfection efficacies of the LPDs were found to be higher when using the TC lipids compared to the DC analogues, so experiments were carried out to investigate the reasons for this enhancement. Sizing experiments and transmission electron microscopy indicated that there were no major differences in the size and shape of the LPDs prepared using the TC and DC lipids, while circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that the presence of the third acyl chain did not influence the conformation of the DNA within the LPD. In contrast, small angle neutron scattering studies showed a considerable re-arrangement of lipid conformation upon formulation as LPDs, particularly of the TC lipids, while gel electrophoresis studies revealed that the use of a TC lipid in the LPD formulation resulted in enhanced DNA protection properties. Thus, the major enhancement in transfection performance of these novel TC lipids can be attributed to their ability to protect and subsequently release DNA. Importantly, the TC lipids described here highlight a valuable structural template for the generation of gene delivery vectors, based on the use of lipids with three hydrophobic chains."
1227,J,"Trifluoroacetic acid catalysed lactonization of vicinal disubstituted.-hydroxyesters was investigated in different solvents. The reaction kinetics, monitored by NMR spectroscopy, showed that: (i) the vic-disubstituent effect is stereoselective since the anti diastereoisomer ring closes substantially more rapidly than the syn isomer ring; (ii) the anti-vic effect is much stronger than the classical Thorpe-Ingold effect (known also as the gem-disubstituent effect), instead the syn diastereoisomers have rate constants comparable to that of the gem-disubstituted ester; (iii) the vic-effect can be enhanced by increasing the steric hindrance of one of the two substituents or carrying out the reaction in non-polar solvents. DFT computations of energy barriers (Delta G(double dagger)) were in good agreement with the experimental data. The distortion/interaction- activation strain model together with the Winstein-Holness kinetic scheme gave more insights into the origin of the vic-effect. An application of this effect consists of the diastereomeric resolution of disubstituted. and d lactones, among which are the naturally occurring Nicotiana t. lactone, the whisky and cognac oak lactones, and the Aerangis lactone. Both cis and trans diastereoisomers of these lactones were isolated in good yield and with high diastereomeric excess (de > 92%). The selectivities of the diastereomeric resolution process, determined by NMR spectroscopy, are reported as well."
1228,J,"Economical and environmentally-friendly routes to convert feed-stock chemicals like acetate into valuable chiral products such as (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate are in demand. Here, seven enzymes (CoaA, CoaD, CoaE, ACS, BktB, PhaB, and GDH) are employed in a onepot, in vitro, biocatalytic synthesis of (3R)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, which was readily isolated. This platform generates not only chiral diketide building blocks but also desirable CoA derivatives."
1229,J,"BrCCl3 represents a rarely used benzylic brominating reagent with complementary reactivity to other reagents. Its reactivity has been revisited in continuous flow, revealing compatibility with electron-rich aromatic substrates. This has brought about the development of a p-methoxybenzyl bromide generator for PMB protection, which was successfully demonstrated on a pharmaceutically relevant intermediate on 11 g scale, giving 91% yield and a PMB-Br space-time-yield of 1.27 kg L-1 h(-1)."
1230,J,"Prostate cancer represents a major public health threat as it is one of the most common male cancers worldwide. The prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is highly over-expressed in prostatic cancer cells in a manner that correlates with both tumour stage and clinical outcome. As such, PSMA has been identified as an attractive target for both imaging and treatment of prostate cancer. In recent years the focus on urea-based peptidomimetic inhibitors of the PSMA (representing low molecular weight/high affinity binders) has intensified as they have found use in the clinical imaging of prostate tumours. Reported herein are the design, synthesis and evaluation of a new fluorinated PSMA targeting small-molecule, FDA-PEG-GUL, which possesses the Glu-NH-CO-NH-Lys pharmacophore conjugated to a 5'-fluorodeoxy- adenosine unit. Inhibition assays were performed with FDA-PEG-GUL which revealed that it inhibits the PSMA in the nanomolar range. Additionally, it has been purposely designed so that it can be produced using the fluorinase enzyme from its chlorinated precursor, allowing for the enzymatic synthesis of radiolabelled [F-18]FDA-PEG-GUL via a nucleophilic reaction that takes place in experimentally advantageous conditions (in water at neutral pH and at ambient temperature). Specific binding of [F-18]FDA-PEG-GUL to PSMA expressing cancer cells was demonstrated, validating it as a promising PSMA diagnostic tool. This work establishes a successful substrate scope expansion for the fluorinase and demonstrates its first application towards targeting the PSMA."
1231,J,"Bryostatins with modified C17-C27 fragments have not been widely studied. The synthesis of 20,20-difluorinated analogues was therefore investigated. Such substitution would inhibit dehydration involving the C19-hydroxyl group and stabilise the ring-closed hemiacetal tautomers. Following preliminary studies, allyldifluorination was used to prepare difluorinated alkenols. Oxidation followed by stereoselective Wittig reactions of the resulting alpha,alpha-difluorinated ketones gave (E)-alpha,beta-unsaturated esters that were taken through to complete syntheses of 2-hydroxytetrahydropyrans corresponding to C17-C27 fragments of 20,20-difluorinated bryostatin. These compounds showed modest binding to protein kinase C alpha isozyme. Attempts were also undertaken to synthesise macrocyclic 20,20-difluorinated analogues. During preliminary studies, allyldifluorination was carried out using a 2-alkyl-3-bromo-1,1-difluoropropene."
1232,J,"The latter steps in this biosynthetic pathway for the antimalarial phosphonic acid FR-900098 include the installation of a hydroxamate onto 3-aminopropylphosphonate, which is catalyzed by the consecutive actions of an acetyltransferase and an amine hydroxylase. Here, we present the 1.6 A resolution co-crystal structure and accompanying biochemical characterization of FrbG, which catalyzes the hydroxylation of aminopropylphosphonate. We show that FrbG is a flavin-dependent N-hydroxylating monooxygenase (NMO), which shares a similar overall structure with flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs). Notably, we also show that the cytidine-5'-monophosphate moiety of the substrate is a critical determinant of specificity, distinguishing FrbG from other FMOs in that the nucleotide cofactor-binding domain also serves in conferring substrate recognition. In the FrbG-FAD+-NADPH co-crystal structure, the C4 of the NADPH nicotinamide is situated near the N5 of the FAD isoalloxazine, and is oriented with a distance and stereochemistry to facilitate hydride transfer."
1233,J,"The amyloidogenic A(42) peptide was efficiently prepared using a double linker system, markedly improving solubility and chromatographic peak resolution, thus enabling full characterisation using standard techniques. The tag was readily cleaved with sodium hydroxide and removed by aqueous extraction, affording A(42) in high purity and yield for biophysical characterisation studies."
1234,J,"Thiotetronate-containing natural products, including thiolactomycin, thiotetromycin, and thiotetroamide, are potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial compounds that target fatty acid synthesis in bacteria. Natural modifications at the C-5 dialkyl position in this molecular series result in pronounced bioactivity differences. The C-5 acetamide-containing thiotetroamide, which is the more potent antibacterial agent in this family, is biosynthesized from the C-5 ethyl analogue thiotetromycin via a unique two-enzyme process involving the cytochrome P450-amidotransferase enzyme pair TtmP-TtmN. Herein we synthesized a focused library of 17 novel thiotetromycin derivatives differing at the 5-position alkyl substituent to investigate their biological activities and their reactivity towards the hydroxylase TtmP. Although we observed marginal anti-tuberculosis activity, select thiotetromycin analogues showed antibacterial activity against an Escherichia coli Delta tolC strain with IC50 values in a range of 1.9-36 mu g mL(-1). Additional screening efforts highlighted select thiotetronate analogues as inhibitors of the cancer-associated enzyme nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT), with a unique scaffold compared to previously identified NNMT inhibitors. In vitro assays further showed that the TtmP P450 was capable of resolving racemic substrate mixtures and had modest promiscuity to hydroxylate derivatives with variable alkyl chains; however triple oxidation to a carboxylic acid remained specific for the natural thiotetromycin substrate. The tendency of TtmP to accept a range of unnatural substrates for hydroxylation makes it an interesting target for P450 engineering towards broader applications."
1235,J,"In the beta-D-galactopyranoside-binding protein galectin-3, synthetic inhibitors substituted at the 3-position of a thiodigalactoside core cause the formation of an aglycone binding pocket through the displacement of an arginine residue (Arg144) from its position in the apoprotein. To examine in detail the role of different molecular interactions in this pocket, we have synthesized a series of nine 3-(4-(2,3,5,6-tetrafluorophenyl)- 1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)-thiogalactosides with different para substituents and measured their affinities to galectin-3 using a fluorescence polarization assay. High-resolution crystal structures (< 1.3 angstrom) have been determined for five of the ligands in complex with the C-terminal domain of galectin-3. The binding affinities are rationalised with the help of the three-dimensional structures and quantum-mechanical calculations. Three effects seem to be involved: Firstly, the binding pocket is too small for the largest ligands with ethyl and methyl. Secondly, for the other ligands, the affinity seems to be determined mainly by desolvation effects, disfavouring the polar substituents, but this is partly counteracted by the cation-pi interaction with Arg144, which stacks on top of the substituted tetrafluorophenyl group in all complexes. The results provide detailed insight into interactions of fluorinated phenyl moieties with arginine- containing protein binding sites and the complex interplay of different energetic components in defining the binding affinity."
1236,J,"The first non-natural derivative of the rare D-glucose-2-phosphate (G2P), namely glucose-2-(O-lactic acid phosphate) (G2LP), has been synthesized. When used as sole carbon source, G2LP enables bacterial growth of the plant pathogenic strain Agrobacterium fabrum C58 (formerly referred to as Agrobacterium tumefaciens). X-ray crystallography and affinity measurements investigations reveal that G2LP binds the periplasmic binding protein (PBP) AccA similarly to the natural compounds and with the same affinity. Moreover, enzymatic assays show that it is able to serve as substrate of the phosphodiesterase AccF. The properties found for G2LP demonstrate that the very unusual glucose-2-phosphoryl residue, present in G2LP, can be used as structural feature for designing non-natural systems fully compatible with the Acc cascade of A. fabrum."
1237,J,"delta-Cadinene synthase (DCS) is a high-fidelity sesquiterpene synthase that generates delta-cadinene as the sole detectable organic product from its natural substrate (E, E)-FDP. Previous work with this enzyme using substrate analogues revealed the ability of DCS to catalyse both 1,10-and 1,6-cyclisations of substrate analogues. To test whether this apparent promiscuity was an artefact of alternate substrate use or an inherent property of the enzyme, aza analogues of the proposed alpha-bisabolyl cation intermediate were prepared since this cation would be formed after an initial 1,6-cyclisation of FDP. In the presence of 250 mu M inorganic disphosphate both (R)-and (S)-aza-bisaboyl cations were potent competitive inhibitors of DCS (K-i = 2.5 +/- 0.5 mM and 3.44 +/- 1.43 mu M, respectively). These compounds were also shown to be potent inhibitors of the 1,6-cyclase amorpha-4,11-diene synthase but not of the 1,10-cyclase aristolochene synthase from Penicillium roquefortii, demonstrating that the 1,6-cyclase activity of DCS is most likely an inherent property of the enzyme even when the natural substrate is used and not an artefact of the use of substrate analogues."
1238,J,"Without using chiral sources, the Strecker reaction of achiral hydrogen cyanide, p-tolualdehyde and benzhydrylamine gave enantioenriched L- or D-N-benzhydryl-alpha-( p-tolyl) glycine nitriles with up to > 99% ee in a mixed solvent of water and methanol. Therefore, total spontaneous resolution of alpha-aminonitriles could occur through a prebiotic mechanism of alpha-amino acid synthesis. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the repetition of partial dissolution and crystallization of a suspended conglomerate of aminonitrile under solution-phase racemization could generate the enantiomeric imbalance to afford, in combination with the amplification of chirality, an enantioenriched product in every case. Among the 73 experiments that were carried out, D-and L-enriched isomers occurred 36 and 37 times, respectively. This stochastic behavior, under achiral or racemic starting conditions, meets the requirements of the spontaneous absolute asymmetric Strecker synthesis. The implications of the present results for the origin of chirality of alpha-amino acids are discussed."
1239,J,"Retama raetam is a bush which is a member of the family Fabaceae. It is used traditionally in North Africa and Saudi Arabia for the treatment of diabetes. Several flavonoids and alkaloids are already known from this plant. Chromatographic fractionation and purification led to the isolation of three new derivatives of prenylated flavones, retamasin C-E, and four new derivatives of prenylated isoflavones, retamasin F-I, in addition to two isoflavones which have not been previously reported in this plant. Particularly interesting structures included isoflavones containing 3,5-dihydro-2H-2,5-methanobenzo[e][1,4]dioxepine and 3a,8b-dihydro-7-hydroxyfuro[3,2-b]benzo[2,1-d]furan units, both of which are new amongst natural product flavonoids. Five new examples (two flavones and three isoflavones) strongly enhanced the glucose-triggered release of insulin by murine pancreatic islets and one isoflavone was a potent inhibitor of a-glucosidase. This study may rationalise the traditional medicinal use of R. raetam and provide new leads for drug design in the treatment of diabetes."
1240,J,"Due to their homogeneity, tuneable properties, low cost and ease of manufacture, thermally induced phase separation (TIPS) polymeric microparticles are emerging as an exciting class of injectable device for the treatment of damaged tissue or complex diseases, such as cancer. However, relatively little work has explored enhancing surface functionalisation of this system. Herein, we present the functionalisation of TIPS microparticles with both small molecules and an antibody fragment of Herceptin (TM), via a heterobifunctional pyridazinedione linker capable of participating in SPAAC """"click"""" chemistry, and compare it to the traditional method of preparing active-targeted microparticle systems, that is, physisorption of antibodies to the microparticle surface. Antigen-binding assays demonstrated that functionalisation of microparticles with Herceptin Fab, via a pyridazinedione linker, provided an enhanced avidity to HER2+ when compared to traditional physisorption methods."
1241,J,"The diastereoselective synthesis of trisubstituted olefins with concomitant C-C bond formation is still a difficult challenge, and olefin metathesis reactions for the formation of such alkenes are usually not high yielding or/and diastereoselective. Herein we report an efficient and diastereoselective synthesis of trisubstituted olefins flanked by an allylic alcohol, by a silicon-tether ring-closing metathesis strategy. Both E- and Z-trisubstituted alkenes were synthesised, depending on the method employed to cleave the silicon tether. Furthermore, this methodology features a novel Peterson olefination for the synthesis of allyldimethylsilanes. These versatile intermediates were also converted into the corresponding allylchlorodimethylsilanes, which are not easily accessible in high yields by other methods."
1242,J,"A synthetic strategy to BODIPY dyes is presented giving access to a range of new compounds relevant in the context of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT). BODIPYs with the 8-(4-fluoro-3-nitrophenyl) and the 8-pentafluorophenyl substituents were used for the synthesis of new mono- and dibrominated BODIPYs. The para-fluorine atoms in these electron-withdrawing groups facilitate functional modification via nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) with a number of amines and thio-carbohydrates. Subsequently, the antibacterial phototoxic activity of these BODIPYs has been assessed in bacterial assays against the Gram-positive germ S. aureus and also against the Gram-negative germ P. aeruginosa. The bacterial assays allowed to identify substitution patterns which ensured antibacterial activity not only in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) but also in the presence of serum, hereby more realistically modelling the complex biological environment that is present in clinical applications."
1243,J,"Internalization of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCRs) represents a nearly universal pathway for receptor downregulation. Imaging this process provides a means for the identification of pharmaceutical agents as well as potential ligands for orphan receptors. However, there is a need for the further development of near-infrared (NIR) probes capable of monitoring internalization in order to enable multiplexing with existing green fluorescent GPCR activity assays. Our laboratory has recently described a series of near-infrared (NIR) fluorophores in which a phosphinate functionality is inserted at the bridging position of the xanthene scaffold. These fluorophores, termed Nebraska Red (NR) dyes, provide attractive reagents for imaging protein localization. Herein, we disclose the development of NR-based HaloTag ligands for imaging membrane proteins on living cells. These new probes are utilized to image membrane pools of the human orexin type 2 receptor, an established target for the treatment of insomnia. We demonstrate the ability of fetal bovine serum (FBS) to noncovalently associate with a spirolactonized NR probe, enabling no-wash imaging with a 45-fold enhancement of fluorescence. Furthermore, we characterize the utility of NR-based HaloTag ligands for real-time monitoring of receptor internalization upon agonist stimulation. These new reagents enable potential multiplexing with existing GPCR activity assays in order to identify new modulators of GPCR activity as well as ligands for orphan receptors."
1244,J,"A brief literature survey reveals that metal-free ligation such as the maleimide-based cycloaddition with electron-rich (hetero)dienes is a widespread tool for the assembly of (bio)molecular systems with applications in biotechnology, materials science, polymers and bio-organic chemistry. Despite their everyday use, only scattered data about their kinetics as well as the stabilities of corresponding products under physiological conditions, are accessible. These key parameters are yet, of paramount importance to ensure the rapid and effective preparation of stable compounds. Herein is reported a systematic study regarding the different classes of dienes used in chemoselective ligation, including their accessibility and stability, as well as comparative kinetic experiments and products stability assays. We took advantage of these data to develop a double labeling strategy from the combined use of cyclopentadiene and oxazole dienes."
1245,J,"We describe a novel green-emitting tetraphenylethylene-dicyanomethylene-4H-pyran (TPE-DCM) based fluorescent probe (TD-1). Conjugating TPE and DCM moieties allowed TD-1 to display high selectivity for thiophenol with excellent AIE properties in aqueous solution. Nevertheless, the poor water solubility of the hydrophobic structure resulted in a weak and unstable emission intensity. The non-covalent self-assembly of TD-1 with a TPE glycocluster (TPE2S) led to a largely improved water solubility producing a reliable and stable sensing system. The corresponding glyco-probe could sensitively detect exogenous thiophenol concentrations in PBS buffer or environmental water samples."
1246,J,"DBU mediated 5-exo-dig cyclization of isothiocyanate and propargyl alcohol leading to valuable heterocyclic compounds has been accomplished. The different modes of nucleophilicity (either S-selective or N-selective) of isothiocyanates were found to depend on the substitution pattern of propargyl alcohol. The terminal propargyl alcohol and isothiocyanate underwent an N-nucleophilic attack to afford 3-substituted 4-methylene oxazolidine-2-thiones. In contrast, exclusive S-nucleophilic cyclization was observed with internal propargyl alcohol to produce (Z)-1,3-oxathiol-2-ylidenes and (Z)-N-(Z)-4-ethylidene-1,3-oxathiolan-2-ylidenes from secondary and primary propargyl alcohols, respectively. The formation of high Z-selectivity in the imine motif and alkene is the highlight of this new method as multiple selectivities over C = N and C = C in a single system are synthetically highly challenging. The Z-selectivity in imine and alkene may be attributed to electronic and steric factors respectively."
1247,J,"The self-assembly of triaminopyrimidines with barbiturates and with cyanates was investigated in chloroform solution. Equimolar mixtures of two complementary components form stable macrocyclic 3 : 3 complexes (rosettes). The thermodynamics of self-assembly were quantified by using H-1 NMR titrations to measure the strength of pairwise H-bonding interactions between two rosette components (K), allosteric cooperativity associated with formation of a second H-bonding interaction with each component, and the effective molarity for cyclisation of the rosette motif (EM). Pyrimidine-cyanurate interactions are an order of magnitude more favourable than pyrimidine-barbiturate interactions, so the cyanurate rosettes are significantly more stable than barbiturate rosettes. There is no allosteric cooperativity associated with rosette formation, but the chelate cooperativity quantified by the product K EM is exceptionally high (10(2)-10(4)), indicating that there are no other species present that compete with rosette assembly. The values of EM for rosette formation are approximately 2 M for all four rosettes studied and are not affected by differences in peripheral substituents or intrinsic H-bond strength."
1248,J,"Sterically hindered aminoarylboranes featuring atropisomerism about the C-B bond were prepared by addition of organomagnesium species onto readily accessible dialkylamine-borane complexes. Some of these aminoarylboranes, isosteres of vinyl styrene derivatives, were resolved by HPLC on the chiral stationary phase. They are the first examples of a non-biaryl type system which display slow rotation about a C-B bond."
1249,J,"The practical synthesis of carbohydrate-based NHC-Rh complexes bearing C1 or C3 sterically differentiated positions, accessed by glycosylation or SNAr strategies, is reported. These catalysts exhibit pseudo-enantiomeric behaviour in the hydrosilylation of acetophenone. We show that steric bulk at C1 gives preference for (S)-phenyl-1-ethanol, while bulk at C3 leads to the (R)-enantiomer. These results represent the first example of pseudo-enantiomeric carbohydrate-based NHC ligands leading to enantiotopic discrimination."
1250,J,"The human cell surface trisaccharide motifs globotriose and P1 antigen play key roles in infections by pathogenic bacteria, which makes them important synthetic targets as antibacterial agents. Enzymatic strategies to install the terminal alpha 1,4-galactosidic linkage are very attractive but have only been demonstrated for a limited set of analogues. Herein, a new bacterial alpha 1,4 galactosyltransferase from N. weaveri was cloned and produced recombinantly in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells, followed by investigation of its substrate specificity. We demonstrate that the enzyme can tolerate galactosamine (GalN) and also 6-deoxygalactose and 6-deoxy-6-fluorogalactose as donors, and lactose and N-acetyllactosamine as acceptors, leading directly to analogues of Gb3 and P1 that are valuable chemical probes and showcase how biocatalysis can provide fast access to a number of unnatural carbohydrate analogues."
1251,J,"An efficient, modular continuous flow process towards accessing two orthogonally protected glycals is described with the development of reaction conditions for several common protecting group additions in flow, including the addition of benzyl, naphthylmethyl and tert-butyldimethylsilyl ethers. The process affords the desired target compounds in 57-74% overall yield in just 21-37 minutes of flow time. Furthermore, unlike batch conditions, the flow processes avoided the need for active cooling to prevent unwanted exotherms and required shorter reaction times."
1252,J,"O-Cyclopropyl hydroxylamines, now accessible via a novel and scalable synthetic route, have been demonstrated to be bench-stable and practical precursors for the synthesis of N-heterocycles via a di-heteroatom [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. In order to study the reactivity of these compounds in depth, a robust synthesis of both ring-substituted and ring-unsubstituted O-cyclopropyl hydroxylamines has been developed. Metal-free conditions for the facile N-arylation of these precursors were also identified. It was found that the N-arylated O-cyclopropyl hydroxamates can efficiently undergo a one-pot [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement/cyclization/rearomatization cascade under base-mediated conditions to furnish a structurally diverse set of substituted tetrahydroquinolines."
1253,J,"Recurrence and drug resistance are major challenges in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that spur efforts to identify new clinical targets and active agents. STAT3 has emerged as a potential target in resistant AML, but inhibiting STAT3 function has proven challenging. This paper describes synthetic studies and biological assays for a naphthalene sulfonamide inhibitor class of molecules that inhibit G-CSF-induced STAT3 phosphorylation in cellulo and induce apoptosis in AML cells. We describe two different approaches to inhibitor design: first, variation of substituents on the naphthalene sulfonamide core allows improvements in anti-STAT activity and creates a more thorough understanding of anti-STAT SAR. Second, a novel approach involving hybrid sulfonamide-rhodium(ii) conjugates tests our ability to use cooperative organic-inorganic binding for drug development, and to use SAR studies to inform metal conjugate design. Both approaches have produced compounds with improved binding potency. In vivo and in cellulo experiments further demonstrate that these approaches can also lead to improved activity in living cells, and that compound 3aa slows disease progression in a xenograft model of AML."
1254,J,"Oligoacetylacetones consisting of 3,3-disubstituted pentane-2,4-diones were synthesized through a terminal silylation and oxidative coupling protocol. Highly selective formation of mono-enol silyl ethers of 3,3-disubstituted acetylacetones was achieved using 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) as a base. Subsequent silver(i) oxide mediated coupling reactions provided tetraketones. Unique substituent dependence was found for the terminal-selective silylation of tetraketones. Finally, octaketones (tetramers of acetylacetone derivatives) with three types of monomer sequences were prepared in their discrete forms. Single crystal X-ray analysis revealed that the solid-state conformations of oligoketone chains were predominantly governed by the ketone sequence rather than substituents. However, differences in the packing structures induced by alkyl substituents led to significant differences in melting points for the structural isomers of octaketones."
1255,J,"Total synthesis of isatindigotindoline C, a 3,3 '-spiropyrrolidine oxindole alkaloid, is achieved in two steps using an exo-selective decarboxylative 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition as the key step. The synthesis verifies the originally assigned relative anti-stereochemistry for the bis-oxindole core of isatindigotindoline C."
1256,J,"Base-catalyzed, C-alkylation of potassium (K) enolates with styrenes (CAKES) has recently emerged as a highly practical and convenient method for elaboration or synthesis of pharmaceutically-relevant cores. K enolate-type precursors such as alkyl-substituted heterocycles (pyridines, pyrazines and thiophenes), ketones, imines, nitriles and amides undergo C-alkylation reactions with styrene in the presence of KOtBu or KHMDS. Surprisingly, no studies have probed the reaction mechanism beyond the likely initial formation of a K enolate. Herein, a synergistic approach of computational (DFT), kinetic and deuterium labelling studies rationalizes various experimental observations and supports a metal-ene-type reaction for amide CAKES. Moreover, our approach explains experimental observations in other reported C-alkylation reactions of other enolate-type precursors, thus implicating a general mechanism for CAKES."
1257,J,"The elusive flavin semiquinone intermediate found in flavoproteins such as cryptochromes has been obtained in aqueous solution by single electron reduction of the natural FMN cofactor using sodium ascorbate. This species was formed in the local hydrophobic microenvironment of a modified polyethyleneimine and characterized by UV-Visible, fluorescence and EPR spectroscopies."
1258,J,"Ionic polysaccharides are part of many biological events, but lack structural characterisation due to challenging purifications and complex synthesis. Four monosaccharides bearing modifications not found in nature are used for the automated synthesis of a collection of ionic oligosaccharides. Structural analysis reveals how the charge pattern affects glycan conformation."

1260,J,A highly efficient disulfide rebridging strategy for the modification of monoclonal antibodies with substituted divinyltriazine linkers is reported. The reaction proceeds efficiently under mild conditions with near stoichiometric quantities of linker. This method of conjugation yields serum stable antibody conjugates with a controlled payload loading of4.
1261,J,"Multivalent interactions between complex carbohydrates and oligomeric C-type lectins govern a wide range of immune responses. Up to date, standard SPR (surface plasmon resonance) competitive assays have largely been to evaluate binding properties from monosaccharide units (low affinity, mM) to multivalent elemental antagonists (moderate affinity, mu M). Herein, we report typical case-studies of SPR competitive assays showing that they underestimate the potency of glycoclusters to inhibit the interaction between DC-SIGN and immobilized glycoconjugates. This paper describes the design and implementation of a SPR direct interaction over DC-SIGN oriented surfaces, extendable to other C-type lectin surfaces as such Langerin. This setup provides an overview of intrinsic avidity generation emanating simultaneously from multivalent glycoclusters and from DC-SIGN tetramers organized in nanoclusters at the cell membrane. To do so, covalent biospecific capture of DC-SIGNviaStreptagII/StrepTactin interaction preserves tetrameric DC-SIGN, accessibility and topology of its active sites, that would have been dissociated using standard EDC-NHS procedure under acidic conditions. From the tested glycoclusters libraries, we demonstrated that the scaffold architecture, the valency and the glycomimetic-based ligand are crucial to reach nanomolar affinities for DC-SIGN. The glycocluster3 center dot Dillustrates the tightest binding partner in this set for a DC-SIGN surface (K-D= 18 nM). Moreover, the selectivity at monovalent scale of glycomimeticDcan be easily analyzed at multivalent scale comparing its binding over different C-type lectin immobilized surfaces. This approach may give rise to novel insights into the multivalent binding mechanisms responsible for avidity and make a major contribution to the full characterization of the binding potency of promising specific and multivalent immodulators."
1262,J,Chiral non-racemic palladacycles were employed as precatalysts for Pd(0) mediated asymmetric synthesis. Addition of HPAr2/base to a ferrocenyloxazoline planar chiral palladacycle resulted in ligand synthesis and palladium capture to give a bidentate Phosferrox/Pd(0) complex. A series of these complexes were generatedin situand applied successfully as catalysts for asymmetric allylic alkylation.
1263,J,"The synthesis and use of oxetane modified dipeptide building blocks in solution and solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) is reported. The preparation of building blocks containing non-glycine residues at the N-terminus in a stereochemically controlled manner is challenging. Here, a practical 4-step route to such building blocks is demonstrated, through the synthesis of dipeptides containing contiguous alanine residues. The incorporation of these new derivatives at specific sites along the backbone of an alanine-rich peptide sequence containing eighteen amino acids is demonstratedviasolid-phase peptide synthesis. Additionally, new methods to enable the incorporation of all 20 of the proteinogenic amino acids into such dipeptide building blocks are reported through modifications of the synthetic route (for Cys and Met) and by changes to the protecting group strategy (for His, Ser and Thr)."
1264,J,"i-Motifs are largely underexplored tetraplex nucleic acid structures which have been suggested to perform essential biological functions and might constitute future therapeutic targets.i-Motifs generally require acidic conditions to foldin vitro, a particularity which significantly complicates the use of nativei-motif forming sequences for interaction studies with potential ligands and biological components (e.g.proteins). In this context, we report herein on the assembly of a peptide-DNA conjugate capable of folding at room temperature into a stablei-motif structure at neutral pH. To achieve the controlled assembly of thei-motif forming conjugate, we developed a new synthetic pathway of four successive orthogonal ligation reactions between bifunctional C-rich DNA strands and a tetrafunctional cyclopeptide scaffold."
1265,J,"The picoloyl ester (Pico) has proven to be a versatile protecting group in carbohydrate chemistry. It can be used for the purpose of stereocontrolling glycosylationsviaan H-bond-mediated Aglycone Delivery (HAD) method. It can also be used as a temporary protecting group that can be efficiently introduced and chemoselectively cleaved in the presence of practically all other common protecting groups used in synthesis. Herein, we will describe a new method for rapid, catalytic, and highly chemoselective removal of the picoloyl group using inexpensive copper(ii) or iron(iii) salts."
1266,J,"The cytochromes P450 are a versatile class of enzymes involved in many chemical reactions in biosystems and as such they take part in biodegradation as well as biosynthesis pathways in many organisms. These enzymes use molecular oxygen on a heme centre and often react as mono-oxygenases. Lesser known reactions catalyzed by the P450s include desaturation pathways and ring-closure reactions. In this work we study the aromatic cross-linking of glycopeptide units as, for instance, performed by the P450 isozyme OxyB as part of vancomycin biosynthesis. A series of density functional theory studies are reported on a large active site cluster model of 258 atoms containing the heme with its coordinated ligands, a representative substrate and its interacting protein residues. We show that the catalytic cycle intermediates Compound I and Compound II of P450 can rapidly and successively abstract a phenolic hydrogen atom from adjacent peptide groups to give a biradical intermediate with small reaction barriers. The latter can form the ether cross-link between the two aromatic residues, which is the rate-determining step in the reaction mechanism and involves a simultaneous proton transfer from theipso-position to the ketone. A thermochemical analysis reveals that weak phenolic O-H bonds lead to hydrogen atom abstraction easily by Compound I and Compound II, enabling a selective aromatic cross-linking reaction."
1267,J,"Noncoding RNAs are increasingly promising drug targets yet ligand design is hindered by a paucity of methods that reveal driving factors in selective small molecule : RNA interactions, particularly given the difficulties of high-resolution structural characterization. HIV RNAs are excellent model systems for method development given their targeting history, known structure-function relationships, and the unmet need for more effective treatments. Herein we report a strategy combining synthetic diversification, profiling against multiple RNA targets, and predictive cheminformatic analysis to identify driving factors for selectivity and affinity of small molecules for distinct HIV RNA targets. Using this strategy, we discovered improved ligands for multiple targets and the first ligands for ESSV, an exonic splicing silencer critical to replication. Computational analysis revealed guiding principles for future designs and a predictive cheminformatics model of small molecule : RNA binding. These methods are expected to facilitate progress toward selective targeting of disease-causing RNAs."

1270,D,"Postharvest loss reduction throughout commodity value chains is an important pathway to food and nutrition security in sub-Saharan Africa. However, lack of understanding of the location and share of the losses and associated factors along the postharvest value chains remains a major challenge to operationalizing postharvest loss mitigation strategies. This paper assesses the determinants of postharvest losses at each postharvest stage of maize and sweetpotato (white fleshed and orange fleshed) value chains for smallholder farmers using our cross-sectional field survey data from two districts in Uganda. An ordered probit model estimation reveals that self-reported perceptions of the level of quantitative postharvest losses at different stages of commodity value chains are influenced by socio-economic factors as well as existing postharvest handling and storage practices. Increased years of education and training received on postharvest management are related to lower perceived levels of postharvest losses at key stages of value chains. Lower perceived postharvest losses are also associated with: at transport to homestead the use of sacks and bicycles as opposed to the use of baskets or transporting by trucks; at drying the use of tarpaulins as opposed to use of plastic sheets; shelling using bare-hands as opposed to beating cobs in sack with sticks; storage in a brick and mortar store as opposed to storing in living room in the house."
1271,D,"Food access is an important element of food security that has since long been a major concern of rural households. One intervention to improve food access has been increased promotion of market production in the hope that households will get increased income and access to food through the market rather than through self-sufficiency characteristic of subsistence production. We examine the effect of market production on household food consumption using a case of rice in western Uganda, where rice is largely a cash crop. Our analysis is based on propensity score matching and instrumental variable approach using survey data collected from 1137 rural households. We find evidence of negative significant effects of market production on calorie consumption; More commercialized households are more likely to consume less than the required calories per adult equivalent per day. This implies that the substitution effects due to higher shadow prices of food outweigh the income effects of additional crop sales. On the contrary, we find positive significant effects on household dietary diversity. We suggest a mixed approach combining policies targeted at market production as well as production for own consumption, and nutrition sensitization."
1272,D,"The Food Consumption Score (FCS), a food frequency indicator developed by the World Food Programme (WFP) that aims to capture both diet quantity and quality of household food consumption, has been validated only against calorie intake in a limited number of rather small countries. This article examines the potential of FCS to capture variation in diet quantity and quality using the 2004/5 Household Consumption and Expenditure Survey (HCES) conducted in the DRC. In addition to quantifying the strength of association between FCS and a series of benchmark variables, a set of nutrient-consistent regional adequacy levels is proposed as an alternative to the standard WFP's cut-off in identifying food insecure households. We point out several key issues. First, for a country the size of the DRC, but possibly in other settings too, it is necessary to adopt a geographically disaggregated approach to account for regional diversity in food systems and resulting diets. Second, FCS can indeed capture qualitative aspects of food consumption in addition to quantitative ones. Third, increasing the number of food groups, removing their associated weights or truncating their food group score does not structurally improve FCS's correlation with the benchmark variables. Fourth, the WFP's threshold is only weakly consistent in terms of nutrient adequacy, marginally relevant to each of the country's regions and markedly less sensitive and specific compared to the set of nutrient-consistent regional thresholds, which we propose based on the empirical relation between FCS and the mean adequacy ratio (MAR). Lastly, despite several methodological challenges, this work demonstrates the potential use of HCES to conduct this sort of food security validation exercises."
1273,D,"Precise agricultural statistics are necessary to track productivity and design sound agricultural policies. Yet, in settings where multi-cropping is prevalent, even crop yield-perhaps the most common productivity metric-can be challenging to measure. In a survey of the literature on crop yield in low-income settings, we find that scholars specify how they estimate the area denominator used to measure yield in under 10% of cases. Using household survey data from Tanzania, we consider four alternative methods of allocating land area on multi-cropped plots, ranging from treatment of the entire plot as the yield denominator to increasingly precise approaches that account for the space taken up by other crops. We then explore the implications of this measurement decision for analyses of yield, focusing on one staple crop that is often grown on its own (rice) and one that is frequently found on mixed plots and in intercropped arrangements (maize). A majority (64%) of cultivated plots contain more than one crop, and average yield estimates vary with different methods of calculating area planted-particularly for maize. Importantly, the choice among area methods influences which of these two crops is found to be more calorie-productive per hectare. This choice also influences the statistically significant correlates of crop yield, such that the benefits of intercropping and including legumes on a maize plot are only evident when using an area measure that accounts for mixed cropping arrangements. We conclude that the literature would benefit from greater clarity regarding how yield is measured across studies."
1274,D,"In developing countries, small-scale fisheries are both a pivotal source of livelihood and essential for the nutritional intake of larger food insecure populations. Distribution networks that move fish from landing sites to coastal and inland consumers offer entry points to address livelihood enhancement and food security objectives of rural development initiatives. To be able to utilize fish distribution networks to address national development targets, a sound understanding of how local systems function and are organized is imperative. Here we present an in-depth examination of a domestic market chain in Timor-Leste that supplies small-pelagic fish to coastal and inland communities. We present the market chain's different commodity flows and its distributive reach, and show how social organization strongly influences people's access to fish, by determining availability and affordability. We suggest there is potential to advance Timor-Leste's food and nutrition security targets by engaging with local influential actors and existing social relations across fish distribution networks. We argue that in addition to developing improvements to fish distribution infrastructure, utilizing existing or locally familiar practices, organization and social capital offers opportunity for long term self-sufficiency. Livelihood and food security improvement initiatives involving natural resource-dependent communities are more likely to succeed if they incorporate rural development perspectives, which frame directly targeted interventions ('intentional' development) within broader structural contexts ('immanent' development)."
1275,D,"Women are over-represented globally among the food insecure population, yet only recently have analyses on gender differences in perceived life satisfaction (LS) controlled for food insecurity (FI). This research hypothesizes that FI is a strong determinant of low LS and that at the same FI level, women will report lower perceived LS than men. Using data collected through the 2014 Gallup (R) World Poll, which included the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES), responses to the FIES (8 questions) comprised the FI variable, with 0 affirmative responses denoting food security, and 1-8 affirmative responses denoting FI. A single well-being question (adapted from Hadley Cantril's Self-Anchoring Striving Scale) comprised the LS variable, with possible answers ranged 0-10. Responses of 4 or lower denoted lower LS, versus 5-10 denoting higher LS. Cross-sectional data from 142 countries shows that, globally, women had higher odds for FI than men in both uncontrolled (Odds Ratio: 1.14, 95% CI=1.11-1.16), as well as controlled models (Odds Ratio: 1.04, 95% CI=1.01-1.07). Those who were food insecure had significantly higher odds of perceiving low LS (Odds Ratio: 3.25, 95% CI=3.14-3.36). Men were less likely to report higher LS than their female counterparts (Odds Ratio: 0.83, 95% CI=0.81-0.86) when controlling for FI. This research provides evidence of differing reports of LS between men and women who experience the same FI status, calling for continued research on why reported LS is lower for men when controlling for FI, what the consequences are for food insecure populations, and what implications exist for national policies."
1276,D,"Ethiopia has achieved the second highest maize yield in sub-Saharan Africa. Yet, farmers' maize yields are still much lower than on-farm and on-station trial yields, and only ca. 20% of the estimated water-limited potential yield. This article provides a comprehensive national level analysis of the drivers of maize yields in Ethiopia, by decomposing yield gaps into efficiency, resource and technology components, and accounting for a broad set of detailed input and crop management choices. Stochastic frontier analysis was combined with concepts of production ecology to estimate and explain technically efficient yields, the efficiency yield gap and the resource yield gap. The technology yield gap was estimated based on water-limited potential yields from the Global Yield Gap Atlas. The relative magnitudes of the efficiency, resource and technology yield gaps differed across farming systems; they ranged from 15% (1.6 t/ha) to 21% (1.9 t/ha), 12% (1.3 t/ha) to 25% (2.3 t/ha) and 54% (4.8 t/ha) to 73% (7.8 t/ha), respectively. Factors that reduce the efficiency yield gap include: income from non-farm sources, value of productive assets, education and plot distance from home. The resource yield gap can be explained by sub-optimal input use, from a yield perspective. The technology yield gap comprised the largest share of the total yield gap, partly due to limited use of fertilizer and improved seeds. We conclude that targeted but integrated policy design and implementation is required to narrow the overall maize yield gap and improve food security."
1277,D,"Integrated home garden interventions combine training in gardening practices with education about nutrition knowledge. Such interventions have been shown to improve nutrition behaviour in low income countries. However, to date rigorous evidence is lacking for their long-term impact. We test the impact of an integrated home garden intervention on vegetable production and consumption three years after the intervention ended. We analyse three rounds of survey data for 224 control and 395 intervention households in rural Bangladesh. Three years after the intervention, the average impact on vegetable production per household was 43 kg/year (+ 49% over baseline levels; p < 0.01), and the effect was not statistically different from the impact one year after the intervention, which demonstrates that impact was maintained in the long-term. The impact on the micronutrient supply for iron, zinc, folate and pro-vitamin A from home gardens was maintained in the long-term. These impacts may have been driven by the long-term improvements in women's nutrition knowledge and gardening practices, explaining the sustainability of the behavioural nutrition change. We also identify positive impacts on women's empowerment and women's output market participation, highlighting how integrated programs, even if modest in scope, can be drivers of social change."
1278,D,"Agri-food systems are essential not only in achieving food security but also in achieving both social and environmental sustainability. Despite different actors use different frameworks to define and assess food systems sustainability, there is growing consensus on the need to approach them from a complex socio-ecological systems perspective. However, existing frameworks often lack the political dimension in the analysis of food systems outcomes. Food sovereignty has emerged as a proposal that centers the discussion in the entire system putting emphasis on the political aspects of food. In this paper, using food sovereignty as a conceptual framework, we propose a quantitative methodology that allows analysis of the functioning of food systems at the international level. We present a database with 97 indicators distributed into six categories: 1) access to resources; 2) productive models; 3) commercialization; 4) food consumption and the right to food; 5) agrarian policies and civil society organization, and 6) gender. We also present the limitations found in developing the database as well as its potential applications for a wide variety of actors."
1279,D,"Over half of all women of reproductive age are affected by anaemia in India. In this paper we study the role that both household market integration and women's empowerment in agriculture can play in determining women's dietary diversity. Our analysis is based on primary data from 3600 households across India on agriculture, nutrition and anthropometric outcomes. We account for market integration by way of per capita household purchases (quantity) of cereals and non- cereal food groups, such as pulses, meat/ fish/ poultry, fruits and vegetables, eggs and dairy. We construct an adapted version of the Abbreviated Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (A-WEAI) that is context- specific and agriculture- oriented. After controlling for individual, household and village- level explanatory factors, we find that - for a given level of per capita market purchases - women who are empowered in their agricultural decisions have significantly higher dietary diversity scores relative to women who are disempowered of such decisions. More specifically it is women's empowerment in two areas: input in production decisions and membership in self- help groups that supports this result. Women's empowerment also enhances dietary diversity in the presence of disaggregated per capita purchases of non-cereals such as pulses, meat, dairy and eggs. This highlights the importance of reorienting India's agricultural price and procurement policies beyond staple grains to ensure better dietary diversity."
1280,D,"Although climate-driven hazards have been widely implicated as a key threat to food security in the delta regions of the developing world, the empirical basis of this assertion has centred predominantly on the food availability dimension of food security. Little is known if climatic hazards could affect the food access of delta-resident households and who is likely to be at risk and why. We explored these questions by using the data from a sample of households resident within the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) delta in Bangladesh. We used an index-based analytical approach by drawing on the vulnerability and food security literature. We computed separate vulnerability indices for flood, cyclone, and riverbank erosion and assessed their effects on household food access through regression modelling. All three vulnerability types demonstrated significant negative effects on food access; however, only flood vulnerability could significantly reduce a household's food access below an acceptable threshold. Households that were less dependent on natural resources for their livelihoods - including unskilled day labourers and grocery shop owners - were significantly more likely to have unacceptable level of food access due to floods. Adaptive capacity, measured as a function of household asset endowments, proved more important in explaining food access than the exposure-sensitivity to flood itself. Accordingly, we argue that improving food security in climatic hazard-prone areas of developing country deltas would require moving beyond agriculture or natural resources focus and promoting hazard-specific, all-inclusive and livelihood-focused asset-building interventions. We provide an example of a framework for such interventions and reflect on our analytical approach."
1281,D,"Many developing countries are undergoing a profound transformation of food systems and retail environments. Especially in urban areas, a rapid growth of supermarkets is observed, which can affect consumer food choices and diets. Supermarkets may improve access to diverse foods at affordable prices, but may also encourage a switch from unprocessed to highly-processed and energy-dense foods that contribute to obesity. However, the use of supermarkets is positively correlated with income. That supermarkets already play an important role for the diets of many urban consumers does not necessarily mean that this is also true for the poorest population segments that are of particular interest for development policy. This article analyzes the diets and food purchase patterns of poor urban consumers in Kenya and Uganda. Representative data were collected from households in the slums of Nairobi and Kampala. The data show that the majority of these households are undernourished. They buy most food items in unprocessed form from various traditional retail outlets, including mom-and-pop shops, local markets, and kiosks. Relatively few sample households buy any of their food in supermarkets. Supermarkets account for only 3% and 0.4% of all food expenditures of slum dwellers in Nairobi and Kampala, respectively. Reasons for the low supermarket use of these poor households are discussed. The findings suggest that a focus on the modern retail sector alone will not suffice to ensure food and nutrition security for all."
1282,D,"A sufficient intake of fruits can alleviate micronutrient deficiencies and reduces the risks of a number of associated diseases. In many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, however, the production and consumption of fruits are inadequate on average and in particular so in specific seasons. To better incorporate fruits into local food systems while addressing the challenge of seasonal availability, World Agroforestry (ICRAF) has developed a methodology based on """"fruit tree portfolios"""" that selects socio-ecologically suitable and nutritionally important fruit tree species for farm production, to meet local consumption needs. We here present this approach and illustrate it with data from a case study involving Western and Eastern Kenya. The approach uses mixed methods to capture on-farm fruit tree diversity and seasonality at a household level (n = 600 in our case study), the months of household's food security and insecurity (n = 600) and food consumption patterns at an individual level, to identify dietary gaps (n = 294 women and child pairs in our example). In our case study, 31 fruit tree species were reported on farms in our Western Kenya sample (9 of which were indigenous) and 51 (27 indigenous) in Eastern Kenya. In addition, the median number of food-insecure months per household was four (ranging from 0 to 9 months) in Eastern Kenya and three (0 to 12 months) in Western Kenya. Finally, using 24-h recalls the proportion of women that had consumed a fruit the day before the interview was around 55% in Western Kenya and 80% in Eastern Kenya, with consumption averaging 93 and 131 g, respectively. Using these parameters for each site and fruit tree phenology and food composition data sets, we derived context-specific recommendations that involve promoting 11 fruit tree species to address micronutrient gaps."
1283,D,"Efforts to increase global food supply through increased productivity and intensity of cropping are well documented. However, the literature on measurement of food losses and wastage and techniques to reduce them is scanty. This study aimed at providing credible evidence on the levels of food losses and wastage at each node along the entire wheat value chain in Jordan - from farm to fork. The """"life cycle of food"""" approach, along with standard protocols developed in line with international initiatives led by the World Resources Institute (WRI) were used for physical measurements and estimation of losses at each node. Our results show that 34% of the total wheat supply in Jordan (both from local production and imports) is lost or wasted - costing the country about US$105 million per year, which is also associated with high levels of losses in natural resources. We found that postharvest losses are more important in Jordan where, at a level of 12.95%, wastage during consumption by households ranks first. Households reported that 67% of the household food waste was fed to animals. This means Jordan is losing 43% and 48% respectively of total protein and energy for every 1US$ spent on bread that is fed to animals instead of barley. These results call for a concerted effort by individuals, civic societies, NGOs and the government towards awareness raising and measures targeting reduction of wastage, especially during consumption. The Government of Jordan has recently reviewed the subsidy on bread, raising hopes that it will reduce consumption losses."
1284,D,"Assessing progress towards healthier people, farms and landscapes through nutrition-sensitive agriculture (NSA) requires transdisciplinary methods with robust models and metrics. Farm-household models could facilitate disentangling the complex agriculture-nutrition nexus, by jointly assessing performance indicators on different farm system components such as farm productivity, farm environmental performance, household nutrition, and livelihoods. We, therefore, applied a farm-household model, FarmDESIGN, expanded to more comprehensively capture household nutrition and production diversity, diet diversity, and nutrient adequacy metrics. We estimated the potential contribution of an NSA intervention targeting the diversification of home gardens, aimed at reducing nutritional gaps and improving livelihoods in rural Vietnam. We addressed three central questions: (1) Do 'Selected Crops' (i.e. crops identified in a participatory process) in the intervention contribute to satisfying household dietary requirements?; (2) Does the adoption of Selected Crops contribute to improving household livelihoods (i.e. does it increase leisure time for non-earning activities as well as the dispensable budget)?; and (3) Do the proposed nutrition-related metrics estimate the contribution of home-garden diversification towards satisfying household dietary requirements? Results indicate trade-offs between nutrition and dispensable budget, with limited farm-household configurations leading to jointly improved nutrition and livelihoods. FarmDESIGN facilitated testing the robustness and limitations of commonly used metrics to monitor progress towards NSA. Results indicate that most of the production diversity metrics performed poorly at predicting desirable nutritional outcomes in this modelling study. This study demonstrates that farm-household models can facilitate anticipating the effect (positive or negative) of agricultural interventions on nutrition and the environment, identifying complementary interventions for significant and positive results and helping to foresee the trade-offs that farm-households could face. Furthermore, FarmDESIGN could contribute to identifying agreed-upon and robust metrics for measuring nutritional outcomes at the farm-household level, to allow comparability between contexts and NSA interventions."

It is very important and necessary to predict the fatigue crack growth between holes of aviation aluminum alloy materials. At present, the investigation on the prediction of the cracks between two holes and multiholes is a key problem to be solved. Due to the fact that the fatigue crack growth test of aluminum alloy plate with two or three holes was carried out by the MTS fatigue testing machine, the crack length growth data under different test conditions were obtained. In this paper, support vector regression (SVR) was used to fit the crack data, and the parameters of SVR are optimized by the grid search algorithm at the same time. And then the model of SVR to predict the crack length was established. Discussion on the results shows that the prediction model is effective. Furthermore, the crack growth between three holes was predicted accurately through the model of the crack law between two holes under the same load form."

1293,H,"This theoretical study explores the impact of heat generation/absorption with ramp wall velocity and ramp wall temperature on the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) time-dependent Oldroyd-B fluid over an unbounded plate embedded in a porous surface. The mathematical analysis of fractional governing partial differential equations has been established using systematic and powerful techniques of Laplace transform with its numerical inversion algorithms. The fractionalized solutions have been traced out separately through all fractional differential operators. Nondimensional parameters along with Laplace transformation are used to find the solution of temperature and velocity profiles. Fractional time derivatives are used to analyze the impact of fractional parameters (memory effect) on the dynamics of the fluid. While making a comparison, it is observed that the fractional-order model is the best to explain the memory effect as compared to classical models. The obtained solutions are plotted graphically for different values of physical parameters. Our results suggest that the velocity profile decreases by increasing the effective Prandtl number. Furthermore, the existence of an effective Prandtl number may reflect the control of the thickness of momentum and enlargement of thermal conductivity."

We exploit a decomposition of the control gain matrix into a symmetric positive-definite matrix, a diagonal matrix with diagonal entries +1 or 1, and a unity upper triangular matrix. Fuzzy logic systems are used for estimating the unknown nonlinear functions. Based on the fractional Lyapunov direct method and some proposed lemmas, a novel fuzzy adaptive controller is designed. The proposed method can guarantee that all the signals in the closed-loop systems remain bounded and the tracking errors converge to an arbitrary small region of the origin. In addition, for updating the parameters of the fuzzy system, fractional-order adaptations laws are proposed. Lastly, an illustrative example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed results."
1299,H,"In the competitive market situation, several companies confer various types of incentives and facilities during product sell to their customers with certain terms and conditions. For the products such as mobile, TV, water purifiers, marshal products, and many more, its corresponding companies offer replacement facility during the guarantee period to enhance the customers' demand. In this study, we have formulated a production inventory model with considering product's replacement facility of the failure product within guarantee periods to their customers. This work also leads two vital assumptions: (i) customers' demand is depending on the replacement period, stock level, and selling price of the product and (ii) the rate of replacement loss of manufacturer's capital is dependent on the replacement period, and it is a nonlinear function. Since the corresponding optimization problem is highly nonlinear, we have solved it by MATHEMATICA software. The concavity of the centre of interval-valued average profit of the proposed model is shown graphically. In order to justify the validity of the proposed model, a numerical example is considered and solved. Finally, the sensitivity analyses are carried out with respect to the different model parameters."

As a consequence of results, we obtain some interesting results. Also as application of the results obtained, we investigate Ulam's stability of fixed point problem and present a solution for the Caputo-type nonlinear fractional integro-differential equation. An example is also provided to illustrate the usability of the obtained results."
1301,H,"The neutrosophic cubic sets (NCSs) attained attraction of many researchers in the current time, so the need to discuss and study their stability was felt. Thus, in this article, we discuss the three types of stability of NCSs such as truth-stability, indeterminacy-stability, and falsity-stability. We define the left (resp., right) truth-left evaluative set, left (resp., right) indeterminacy-evaluative set, and left (resp., right) falsity-evaluative set. A new notion of stable NCSs, partially stable NCSs, and unstable NCSs is defined. We observe that every NCS needs not to be a stable NCS but each stable NCS must be an NCS, i.e., every internal NCS is a stable NCS but an external NCS may or may not be a stable NCS. We also discuss some conditions under which the left and right evaluative points of an external NCS becomes a neutrosophic bipolar fuzz set. We have provided the condition under which an external NCS becomes stable. Moreover, we discuss the truth-stable degree, indeterminacy-stable degree, and falsity-stable degree of NCSs. We have also defined an almost truth-stable set, almost indeterminacy-stable set, almost falsity-stable set, almost partially stable set, and almost stable set with examples. Application of stable NCSs is given with a numerical example at the end."

1304,H,"The main aim of this article is to introduce a new type of q-Chlodowsky and q-Szasz-Durrmeyer hybrid operators on weighted spaces. To this end, we give approximation properties of the modified new q-Hybrid operators. Moreover, in the weighted spaces, we examine the rate of convergence of the modified new q-Hybrid operators by means of moduli of continuity. In addition, we derive Voronovskaja's type asymptotic formula for the related operators."
1305,H,"Suppose that p and q are two distinct odd prime numbers with n=pq. In this paper, the uniform representation of general two-prime generalized cyclotomy with order two over DOUBLE-STRUCK CAPITAL Zn was demonstrated. Based on this general generalized cyclotomy, a type of binary sequences defined over Fl was presented and their minimal polynomials and linear complexities were derived, where l=rs with a prime number r and gcd (l, n) =1. The results have indicated that the linear complexities of these sequences are high without any special requirements on the prime numbers. Furthermore, we employed these sequences to obtain a few cyclic codes over F-l with length n and developed the lower bounds of the minimum distances of many cyclic codes. It is important to stress that some cyclic codes in this paper are optimal."

A submodule N of M is called a uniformly primal submodule provided that the subset B of R is uniformly not right prime to N, if there exists an element s is an element of M-N with sRB subset of N. The set adj( N) = {r is an element of R vertical bar tmRrn subset of qNh for Some m is an element of CM} is uniformly not prime to N.*is paper is concerned with the properties of uniformly primal submodules. Also, we generalize the prime avoidance theorem for modules over noncommutative rings to the uniformly primal avoidance theorem for modules."
1307,H,"A picture fuzzy set (PFS) is an augmentation of Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS).

It has been considered as an essential tool to deal with unsure data during an investigation. In this manuscript, we explore the idea of a picture fuzzy near-ring (PFNR) and a picture fuzzy ideal (PFI) of a near-ring (NR).

1308,H,"We use the notions of left- and right-complete quasi-b-metric spaces and partial ordered sets to obtain a couple of common fixed-point results for strictly weakly isotone increasing mappings and relatively weakly increasing mappings, which satisfy a pair of almost generalized contractive conditions. To illustrate our results, throughout the paper, we give several relevant examples. Further, we use our results to establish sufficient conditions for existence and uniqueness of solution of a system of nonlinear matrix equations and a pair of fractional differential equations. Finally, we provide a nontrivial example to validate the sufficient conditions for nonlinear matrix equations with numerical approximations."
1309,H,"The Brownian motion and thermophoretic impacts attained a noticeable intention of the recent researchers because these factors trigger the thermal conductivity of the nanofluid. In this study, we focus on radiation and Soret effects on a slanted stretchable sheet. Buongiorno's model is taken into account with Brownian motion and thermophoretic effects. Compatible transformations are implemented to attain the nonlinear differential equation from the boundary value PDE's. The physical quantities of practical interest are treated by graphically as well as numerically. For numerical results, the Keller box technique is applied. The numerical outcomes through tabulated magnitudes performed a good settlement with already existing results. Energy transfer rate against involved factor exhibited via graphs. Energy and mass transport rates enhance against increment in Soret factor while skin friction diminishes. Moreover, Nusselt number and Sherwood number decrease on improving inclination while skin friction increases."

1311,H,"This paper is dealt with the following system of difference equations x(n+1) = (a(n)/x(n)) + (b(n)/y(n)), y(n+1) = (c(n)/x(n)) + (d(n)/y(n)), where n is an element of N-0 = N boolean OR {0}, the initial values x(0) and y(0) are the positive real numbers, and the sequences (a(n))(n >= 0), (b(n))(n >= 0), (c(n))(n >= 0), and (d(n))(n >= 0) are two-periodic and positive. The system is an extension of a system where every positive solution is two-periodic or converges to a two-periodic solution. Here, the long-term behavior of positive solutions of the system is examined by using a new method to solve the system."

1313,H,"The method of paired comparisons (PC) is widely used to rank items using sensory evaluations. The PC models are developed to provide basis for such comparisons. In this study, the Weibull PC model is analyzed under the Bayesian paradigm using noninformative priors and different loss functions, namely, Squared Error Loss Function (SELF), Quadratic Loss Function (QLF), DeGroot Loss Function (DLF), and Precautionary Loss Function (PLF). Numerical approximation is used to illustrate the entire estimation procedure. A real dataset showing usage preferences for different cellphone brands, Huawei (HW), Samsung (SS), Oppo (OP), QMobile (QM), and Nokia (NK), is used. Quadrature method is used to evaluate the Bayes estimates, their posterior risks, preference probabilities, predictive probabilities, and posterior probabilities to establish and verify ranking order of the competing cellphone brands under study. The results show that the paired comparison model under the study using Bayesian approach involving various loss functions can offer mathematical approach to evaluate cellphone brand preferences. The ranking provided by the model is justifiable according to the usage preference for these cellphone brands. The ranking given by the model indicates that cellphone brand Samsung is preferred the most and QMobile is the least preferred. The plausibility of the model is also assessed using the Chi square test of goodness of fit."

1315,H,"The present work deals with the construction, development, and analysis of a viable normalized predictor-corrector-type nonstandard finite difference scheme for the SEIR model concerning the transmission dynamics of measles. The proposed numerical scheme double refines the solution and gives realistic results even for large step sizes, thus making it economical when integrating over long time periods. Moreover, it is dynamically consistent with a continuous system and unconditionally convergent and preserves the positive behavior of the state variables involved in the system. Simulations are performed to guarantee the results, and its effectiveness is compared with well-known numerical methods such as Runge-Kutta (RK) and Euler method of a predictor-corrector type."
1316,H,"A novel procedure is utilized to investigate the surface waves between two finite conducting fluids streaming through a porous medium in the presence of a horizontal electric field. Normal mode analysis is applied to study two- and three-dimension disturbances cases. The quadratic dispersion equation of complex coefficients representing the system is derived and discussed. It is noted that based on appropriate data selections, the stability criteria do not depend on the medium permeability. It is found that electrical conductivities, viscosities, medium porosity, and surface tension enhance the stability of the system while the dimension and the fluid velocities decrease the stability of the system. Finally, the fluid depths have a dual role (stabilizing as well as destabilizing effects) on the system."
1317,H,"A novel and efficient numerical method is developed based on interpolating scaling functions to solve 2D Fredholm integral equations (FIE). Using the operational matrix of integral for interpolating scaling functions, FIE reduces to a set of algebraic equations that one can obtain an approximate solution by solving this system.

Firstly, the original system is transformed into an equivalent system. Then, a Nussbaum-type function is added in the predefined performance controller to estimate the unknown control direction, and the boundedness of all signals in the closed-loop system is guaranteed. In addition, tracking errors will always remain within the prescribed performance boundaries. Finally, a comparative simulation example shows the effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper."
1320,I,"Increased use of solar collectors in buildings is necessary but poses major challenges in existing built environ ments, especially where architectural quality is an issue. The large size of solar systems at the building scale requires careful planning, as they may easily end up compromising the aesthetics of buildings, threatening the identity of entire contexts. A new method named LESO-QSV(for Laboratoire d'Energie SOlaire - Qualite Sensibilite-Visibilite) has been developed to help authorities promote solar energy use while preserving the quality of pre-existing urban areas. The vision underlining the approach is that solar integration is possible also in delicate contexts, if appropriate design efforts and adequate cost investments are made. The issue is then no longer to be in favour or against the use of solar systems in cities, but rather to define appropriate local levels of integration quality, and to identify the factors needed to initiate smart solar energy policies able to preserve the quality of pre-existing urban contexts while promoting solar energy use. The LESO-QSV method helps tackle these issues with clear and objective proposals: First it clarifies the notion of architectural integration quality and proposes a simple evaluation method, based on a set of criteria derived from pre-existing literature. Then it helps authorities set and implement local acceptability requirements, introducing the notion of architectural """"criticity"""" of city surfaces (LESO-QSV acceptability). The concept of """"criticity"""", at the basis of the whole approach, is defined by the Sensitivity of the urban context where the solar system is planned, combined with its Visibility (close and remote) from the public domain. The more sensitive the urban area and the more visible the system (high """"criticity""""), the higher the need for integration quality. In practice, authorities will be in charge to set the desired integration quality levels for each of the defined """"criticity"""" situations, considering local specificities (energy context, available energy sources, political and social considerations, city identity and topography, among others). To help authorities set these quality expectations, the software LESO-QSV Grid has been developed. It illustrates the acceptance impact of pre-defined sets of quality requirements, using a large number of integration examples (150 emblematic cases). These detailed examples are provided to show authorities how to objectively evaluate integration quality, but they also constitute a large set of learning examples, good and bad, for architects, installers and building owners. Finally the method proposes a way to tailor solar energy policies to local urban specificities by mapping the architectural """"criticity"""" of city buildings surfaces, and crossing this information with a city solar irradiation map (LESO-QSV crossmapping), hence completing the characterization of the building surfaces with the potentially required effort of integration."
1321,I,"Many solar forecast algorithms based on ground based sky imagery apply the red-blue ratio (RBR) method to classify image pixels as clear or cloudy, by comparing the current image with the corresponding image from a clear sky library (CSL). The CSL needs to be updated regularly due to changes in clear sky readings over time caused by aerosols and imager dome properties. This clear sky library is typically created by visually scrutinizing daily sky videos and selecting appropriate clear sky periods. This practice takes a significant amount of time and manual intervention can result in human errors. To avoid this, an automated CSL algorithm (ACSL) was developed which filters each image for clear sky features including maximum green pixel brightness, average RBR, and red channel difference by pixel with respect to the previous image. The root mean square difference (RMSD) between the image RBR of the manually created CSL and the ACSL for November and April 2013 at UC San Diego were observed to be less than 6% over the full range of solar zenith angles. The ACSL was found to be more representative of clear conditions than its manual counterpart."
1322,I,"Building integration using thin-film flexible photovoltaic (PV) cells with load-carrying structures requires understanding of their electrical performance under continuous mechanical loadings. Limited results mainly focus on the electrical performance of PV cells under certain fixed mechanical strains. In this paper, an approach is examined to continuously apply tensile strains on PV cell specimens; therefore the short circuit current (I-SC) and open circuit voltage (V-OC) are constantly monitored. Two types of PV cells are studied under the proposed approach including amorphous silicon (a-Si) and organic PV cells and the results demonstrate its practicability to determine the critical tensile strains reliably for both PV types. It is found that V-OC is more sensitive than I-SC to the applied tensile strain for both types of PV cells and substantial degradation in Voc for a-Si cells initiates at the tensile strain of 1.51%. For organic cells, significant reduction in V-OC is observed at the critical tensile strain of 1.46% in association with yielding of the substrate. While noticeable degradation can be only observed in I-SC from 1.67% strain for a-Si PV cells and from 3.09% strain for organic ones. In addition, linear declines with temperature in Voc of both PV types are quantified for temperatures over 30 degrees C."
1323,I,"The application of tempered glass has made it possible to significantly reduce the support pillar number within evacuated glazing (EG) since tempered glass (T-glass) is four to ten times mechanically stronger than annealed glass (A-glass). The thermal transmittance (U-value) of 0.4 m by 0.4 m double evacuated glazing (DEG) with 4 mm thick T-glass and A-glass panes with emittance of 0.03 were determined to be 0.3 Wm(-2)K(-1) and 0.57 Wm(-2)K(-1), respectively (47.4% improvement) using previously experimentally validated finite volume model. The thermal transmittance (U-value) of 0.4 m by 0.4 m triple evacuated glazing (TEG) with 4 mm thick T glass and A-glass panes with emittance of 0.03 were determined to be 0.11 Wm(-2)K(-1) and 0.28 Wm(-2)K(-1), respectively (60.7% improvement). The improvement in the U-value of EG with T-glass is due to a reduction in support pillar number, leading to reduction in heat conduction through pillar array. The impact of tempered glass on the thermal transmittance for TEG is greater than that of DEG since radiative heat transfer in TEG is much lower than that in DEG, thus the reduction in heat conduction resulted from the reduction of support pillar number in TEG is much larger than that in DEG."
1324,I,"Hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSC) have gained stupendous achievement in single/tandem solar cell, semitransparent solar cell and flexible devices. Aiming for potential commercialization of perovskite photovoltaic technology, up scalable processing is crucial for all function layers in PSC. Herein we present a study on room temperature magnetron sputtering of tin oxide electron transporting layer (ETL) and apply it in a large area PSC for low cost and continues manufacturing. The SnO2 sputtering targets with varied oxygen and deposition models are used. Specifically, the working gas ratio of Ar/O-2 during the radio frequency sputtering process plays a crucial role to obtain optimized SnO2 film. The sputtered SnO2 films demonstrate similar morphological and crystalline properties, but significant varied defect states and carrier transportation roles in the PSC devices. With further modification of thickness of SnO2, the PSCs based on sputtered SnO2 ETL shows a champion efficiency of 18.20% in small area and an efficiency of 14.71% in sub-module with an aperture area of 16.07 cm(2), which is the highest efficiency of perovskite sub module with sputtered ETLs."
1325,I,"The iron vanadium oxide semiconductor Fe2V4O13 has interesting properties as an absorbent material for the conversion of solar energy. In this work the electronic, magnetic and optical properties of Fe2V4O13 have been obtained and analyzed from theoretical calculations and compared with experimental results. From the results, the main contributions to the optical properties come from the transitions between O-V states. The optical properties have been used to evaluate this compound as a solar energy converter using mono- and multi-junction configurations."
1326,I,"Solar Domestic Hot Water (SDHW) systems represent a constantly evolving technology in today's applications. With the new directives promoted by the European Union the renewable energy share produced in buildings will tend to increase further. Research on how to increase the efficiency of the thermal production from renewable energy are therefore of the foremost importance. This study aims to investigate the energy performance of an integral collector storage (ICS) prototype for DHW production. This ICS represents a new concept technology, integrating inside the same device a flat plate absorber and a storage section with phase change material (PCM) connected by heat pipes filled with methanol. An objective of this study was to investigate a possible alternative to conventional solar systems, with the aim of reducing investment costs and improving system reliability without compromising energy performance. The energy assessment was carried out using a numerical model in the Engineering Equation Solver (EES) environment, following an electrical analogy scheme. After a validation process by means of experimental data, a yearly simulation was launched in order to estimate the productivity and the solar fraction of the prototype. The results obtained allowed a global energy evaluation and a comparison with similar systems and to identify the pros and cons of this new technology."
1327,I,"In this study, temperature distribution and heat transfer through the cavity of a double skin facade (DSF) was investigated in the laboratory environment and analyzed numerically by using nodal network approach. The verification of the nodal network method was conducted by using data from the steady-state experiments and the same method was applied for the climate of Istanbul, Turkey under unsteady outside boundary conditions. Furthermore, heat gain and loss values in DSF for January and July were calculated and compared with single skin facade (SSF) application for different directions of the facades. The results were given for a day and a working time period of the office buildings by using monthly average daily climate data. Distinction working hours were more convenient to investigate the energy performance of DSF because of solar radiation effect. Using DSF in all directions, the cooling loads decreased up to 26% comparing to the SSF. DSF system was disadvantageous comparing to the SSF for January. However, it was shown that the heated air in the cavity could be used for preheating process of air in a HVAC system for winter period."
1328,I,"The aim of this work was to demonstrate the feasibility of producing Portland cement clinker upon direct exposure of the raw materials under concentrated solar radiation using the PSA high concentration solar furnace SF40. For this purpose, a short thermal cycle ( < 40 min) was devised including 5 min dwell times at temperatures in the range 900-950 degrees C and 1250-1300 degrees C, followed by 10-15 min at 1500-1550 degrees C. The chemical and mineralogical data of the grey clinker produced are encouraging since values of 51.0 +/- 6.9% C3S, 22.7 +/- 5.3% C2S, 8.6 +/- 0.4% C(3)A and 10.8 +/- 0.7% C(4)AF are similar to those observed for conventional clinker used for the production of Portland cement in accordance to EN 197-1 standard. White clinker, in turn, could not be produced by direct irradiation in this setup conditions because of its low absorptance of solar energy."
1329,I,"One of the possible causes of degradation of perovskite solar cells is the instability of the electron transporting layer. In this regard, design of air stable electron transport organic semiconductors, compatible with perovskite energy levels presents challenges due to inherent vulnerability to traps, presumably originating due to water and/or oxygen. In this work, we demonstrate air stability of diketopyrrolopyrrole-based molecule (TDPP-CN4) at ambient conditions and its application as electron transporting layer (ETL) in perovskite solar cells. We investigated electron mobility and air stability of TDPP-CN4 by fabricating top-gate bottom-contact (TG-BC) thin film transistors and compared with PCBM at ambient conditions. Both TDPP-CN4 and PCBM exhibit electron transport properties with mobility of 0.13 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) and 0.03 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) respectively. However, we found remarkable air stability of the TDPP-CN4 in the OFET measurements under ambient conditions. These excellent properties of TDPP-CN4 render them as potential ETL layer in inverted planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells. Our preliminary device studies show remarkable short-circuit current (J(sc)) similar to 17.4 mA/cm(2) with moderate open-circuit voltage (V-oc) of 0.50 V. These results suggest that the electron mobility and air-stability of diketopyrrolopyrrole-based molecule hold a promise as Ell in perovskite solar cells at ambient conditions."
1330,I,"Solar thermochemical process technology has great potential to store solar energy as chemical fuels, however, there remain several challenges that have hindered its industrial commercialization. One of the main challenges is the transient nature of solar energy which causes instability and reduces the efficiency of the process. A promising solution to cope with this problem is to use a variable aperture mechanism to regulate the light entry into solar receiver. A robust control algorithm is required to automatically adjust the aperture size and keep the temperature semi-constant under various transient conditions including short or long cloud coverage and natural variation of solar radiation from sunrise to sunset. In our previous work, an adaptive predictive controller was developed for aperture size adjustment and its performance was evaluated by computer simulations. The present work takes our previous study to the next level by experimental evaluation of the proposed controller on a solar receiver radiated by a 7 kW solar simulator. Two different variable aperture mechanisms, namely as iris mechanism and rotary aperture, are used for adjustment of the light entry into the receiver. Experimental results indicate that both of the mechanisms have reasonable performance in response to changes to a setpoint and disturbance in incoming solar radiation. However, the iris mechanism exhibits superior performance due to its capability of continuously changing the aperture size. For an elaborated evaluation of the iris mechanism, a real day of solar irradiation was simulated in the lab by changing the power level of the solar simulator based on a normal irradiance profile of a sunny day. According to the experimental results, the required temperature control was achieved with a maximum error in the temperature setpoint less than 1.95 degrees C."
1331,I,"Borondipyrromethene or BODIPY can be incorporated into the polymer backbone through either the alpha (or 2,6) positions or the beta (3,5) positions and hence resulting in polymers exhibiting structural isomerism. In this work two pairs of such isomeric D-A polymers formed by copolymerization of BODIPY with benzodithiophene (P1 and P2) and fluorene (P3 and P4) separately are reported along with structure property correlation. Depending on the positions of attachment of the BODIPY unit in the isomeric polymers, the geometry of the polymer backbone is either coiled or linear which in turn affects physical properties such as thermal stability, solubility and absorption, electronic properties such as delocalization of molecular orbitals, HOMO-LUMO energy levels and band gap. Though the charge carrier mobility seems to remain unaffected due to the isomerism of the polymer backbone, the alpha connected polymers perform better than the beta connected polymers when used as electron acceptor along with P3HT in all polymer solar cells. This is also the first instance of application of BODIPY copolymers as electron acceptor in organic solar cells."
1332,I,"Daylight plays an important role on the environmental comfort level for buildings. As for the energy consumption in the building, lighting is one of the main contributors. However, traditional building integrated solar utilization systems such as flat photovoltaic or concentrating photovoltaic systems can only supply the heat or the electricity for buildings. Thus, a novel concentrating photovoltaic/daylighting window is proposed as a strategy to effectively generate the renewable electricity for the domestic use while providing a better daylight performance. The indoor experiment and ray tracing simulation are both conducted to identify the effect of the """"daylighting window"""" on the optical performance of the concentrator. The annual daylight performance of a typical office building installed with the concentrating photovoltaic/daylighting window at various installation angles, window-to-ceiling ratios and under different climate conditions is investigated through RADIANCE. The accuracy and confidence of the simulation model is validated through the outdoor experiment, and the deviation between the experimental and simulation results is as low as 8.7%, which is indicated by the coefficient of variation of the root mean squared error. The simulation results show that the concentrating photovoltaic/daylighting window provides a good daylight performance on the working plane of the office room: the percentage of the working hours under daylight that lies in the useful range (100-2000 lx) can be up to 92.00%. It also achieves a homogenous distribution of daylight within the internal working space and effectively reduces the possibility of glare. Through the simulation results under different climate conditions, besides of the solar irradiance, the latitude also has an obvious effect on the annual daylight performance. So for the application in different latitudes, it's highly recommended to be installed with the inclination angel near the local latitude for a higher annual electricity output and better annual daylight performance."
1333,I,"Additive manufacturing (3D printing), combined with computer aided design, is transforming the modern manufacturing industry. Using high temperature techniques such as """"selective laser sintering"""", fabricators are given access to a wide range of starting materials. The sustainability of the approach could be improved through the direct use of concentrated sunlight to sinter these powders. Using inexpensive components, the cost can also be decreased to enable utilization by microbusinesses, especially those operating in remote, off-grid locations. For achieving this goal a high resolution prototype has been developed and constructed using a Fresnel lens design. To determine the feasibility of the method, two dimensional sintering tests were conducted on a commercial Nylon 12 powder. The effects of the most influential parameters on this process were determined through the implementation of a simplified model and dimensional analysis. The most important parameter for the description of the process was found to be the dimensionless ratio of incoming radiative power to power required for sintering or melting. For conditions in which only a single phase transformation takes place, this parameter was found to remain constant, with a mean of 6.84 and variance of 0.04. The limits of the power to speed ratio were also determined, achieving thicknesses as low as 0.3 mm for the selected powder and lens combination. The measured parameters demonstrate the feasibility of high resolution 3D printing using the proposed technique, provided that tailored control strategies are developed. A major limitation was found to be the focal spot size of the lens, which determines the track width. This can be improved from the current value of 3 mm through the use of a cast glass lens."
1334,I,"We introduce a computational framework to forecast cloud index (CI) fields for up to one hour on a spatial domain that covers a city. Such intra-hour CI forecasts are important to produce solar power forecasts of utility scale solar power and distributed rooftop solar. Our method combines a 2D advection model with cloud motion vectors (CMVs) derived from a mesoscale numerical weather prediction (NWP) model and sparse optical flow acting on successive, geostationary satellite images. We use ensemble data assimilation to combine these sources of cloud motion information based on the uncertainty of each data source. Our technique produces forecasts that have similar or lower root mean square error than reference techniques that use only optical flow, NWP CMV fields, or persistence. We describe how the method operates on three representative case studies and present results from 39 cloudy days."
1335,I,"Over the years, there have been efforts to understand the thermodynamics of solar cells so that the physics can be better improved. Heat generation in photovoltaic (PV) modules (which contain solar cells for direct electrical energy generation) has been acknowledged in many literatures as a key power degradation parameter. At the moment, an accurate modeling of photovoltaic power generation requires a computational iterative model since the output voltage of a PV creates a transcendental equation. This study uses code-based model (CBM) which allows user defined codes to implement a novel integration of solar, electrical and thermal exergies of photovoltaic module in order to create a thermophotovoltaic model. After integrating the proposed model in MATLAB, parametric studies were carried out to understand how changes in temperature and solar radiation affect the electrical and thermal exergy flows during power generation. Interestingly, results show that heat is essential for power generation although it should not exceed the critical value beyond which the voltage would start deteriorating. At 290 K, the electrical exergy flow of the 45 W PV module used in this study was 41.46 J/s and the overall improvement in exergy could be up to 51% if the waste heat generated is utilised for useful thermal work. The energy and exergy efficiencies of the PV module were initially the same but the energy efficiency degraded because of the reduction in the open circuit voltage (V-oc) as temperature increased. Lastly, insights from this study is purposed to increase the understanding of how electrical and thermal exergy flow pattern in the PV module can be managed to either stabilise its temperature through cooling and surface treatment or facilitate its heat recovery for photovoltaic-thermal applications."
1336,I,"Globally, PV prosumers account for a significant share of the total installed solar PV capacity, which is a growing trend with ever-increasing retail electricity prices. Further propelled by performance improvements of solar PV and innovations that allow for greater consumer choice, with additional benefits such as cost reductions and availability of incentives. PV prosumers may be one of the most important enablers of the energy transition. PV prosumers are set to gain the most by maximising self-consumption, while avoiding large amounts of excess electricity being fed into the grid. Additionally, electricity and heat storage technologies, heat pumps and battery electric vehicles are complementary to achieve the highest possible self-consumption shares for residential PV prosumer systems, which can reach grid-parity within this decade in most regions of the world. This research finds the cost optimal mix of the various complementary technologies such as batteries, electric vehicles, heat pumps and thermal heat storage for PV prosumers across the world by exploring 4 different scenarios. Furthermore, the research presents the threshold for economical maximum battery capacity per installed PV capacity, along with self-consumption ratios, demand cover ratios and heat cover ratios for 145 different regions across the world. This is a first of its kind study to conduct a global analysis of PV prosumers with a range of options to meet their complete energy demand from a future perspective, up to 2050. Maximising self-consumption from solar PV generation to meet all energy needs will be the most economical option in the future, for households across most regions of the world."
1337,I,"In solar thermal plants, as in any industrial process, it is important to maintain good control of the system and, more importantly, to have a good security system to avoid exceeding the safety limits of the components and avoid their degradation. In the case of solar thermal plants, one of the main components is the Heat Transfer Fluid (HTF), which must be kept below a maximum temperature. Although the temperature of the fluid, in general, will be controlled by modifying the flow-rate, when the plant is saturated HTF temperature is kept under limits by defocusing of the collectors. In this paper, an analysis of the control of the defocus control applied to the different collectors is presented. A Model Predictive Control technique will be applied to control the temperature by defocusing two and four collectors in different situations. It is shown how controlling the temperature by defocusing only two collectors is not sufficient in all situations and that controlling by defocusing the four collectors solves this problem in addition to maintaining the defocus actions in areas with high control authority."
1338,I,"The knowledge of electrical current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of photovoltaic (PV) devices under various irradiance, temperature, and spectral conditions is essential for evaluating the output power and energy production of the devices under various climate conditions. The methods to measure the temperature and irradiance dependences of PV devices power are described in the standards IEC 60891 and IEC 61853-1. Newer PV technologies like organic (OPV) and dye-sensitized (DSSC) devices are rapidly evolving and considerable research effort has addressed alternative approaches to increase efficiency with promising values achieved in the last years. Measurements of the irradiance (G) and temperature (T) dependence of these emerging PV technologies are less established -when available- than those of Si-based devices. In this paper we present a first attempt of power-rating measurement for an OPV mini-module. The measurements were performed with a large-area steady-state solar simulator on a reduced (T,G) range compared to what the standard IEC 61853-1 requires. Nevertheless, they were sufficient to calculate the relative temperature coefficients alpha and beta, which have been satisfactorily compared to previous published values. Also, they provided a first data set for the irradiance dependence of OPV device performance. Finally, the power matrix built from these measurements represents at our knowledge the first data set available for energy rating of OPV technology, as the matrix was done for a single device and for both irradiance and temperature dependencies together."
1339,I,"Calcination of limestone for lime production was successfully performed in the continuous flow mode on a daily basis in a fluidized bed indirectly heated by concentrated solar radiation. Industrial calcium carbonate feedstock was decomposed at the focus of the CNRS 1 MW solar furnace in a pilot-scale solar reactor operating at an average power of 55 kW. The reactor was a four-stage horizontal fluidized bed, irradiated on a front metallic wall of 1 m long and 0.4 m high. A novel aiming strategy was applied to reduce the hot spots on the irradiated wall. The conversion degree was analyzed as a function of the fluidization conditions (air mass flow rate) and the particle mass flow rate. This latter parameter varied in range (14.5 - 25 kg/h), and the highest conversion degrees were obtained at high fluidization velocity. The best result was obtained for a calcite mass flow rate of 20 kg/h, resulting in a degree of conversion of 95.2%, a BET surface area of the lime of 5.39 m(2)/g, and 17% and 29% thermochemical and thermal efficiencies of the reactor, respectively. This achievement corresponds to a particle mass flow rate three times higher than the current state of the art for solar calcination of lime."
1340,I,"Reliable monitoring of PV systems is essential to establish efficient maintenance routines that minimize the levelized cost of electricity. The existing solutions for affordable monitoring of commercial PV systems are however inadequate for climates where snow and highly varying weather result in unstable performance metrics. The aim of this work is to decrease this instability to enable more reliable monitoring solutions for PV systems installed in these climates. Different performance metrics have been tested on Norwegian installations with a total installed capacity of 3.3 MW: (i) comparison of specific yield, (ii) temperature corrected performance ratio, and (iii) power performance index based on both physical modelling and machine learning. The most influential effects leading to instability are identified as snow, low light, curtailment, and systematic irradiance differences over the system. The standard deviation of all the performance metrics is reduced when filters targeting these four effects are applied. Compared to general low irradiance or clear sky filtering, a greater reduction in the variation of the metrics is achieved, and more data remains in the useful dataset. The most suitable performance metrics are comparison of specific yield and performance index based on machine learning modelling. The analysis highlights two paths to accomplish increased reliability of PV monitoring systems without increased hardware costs. First, better reliability can be achieved by selecting a suitable performance metric. Second, the variability of the performance metric can be reduced by utilizing filters that specifically target the origin of the variability instead of using standard literature thresholds."
1341,I,"The field of energy forecasting has attracted many researchers from different fields (e.g., meteorology, data sciences, mechanical or electrical engineering) over the last decade. Solar forecasting is a fast-growing sub-domain of energy forecasting. Despite several previous attempts, the methods and measures used for verification of deterministic (also known as single-valued or point) solar forecasts are still far from being standardized, making forecast analysis and comparison difficult. To analyze and compare solar forecasts, the well-established Murphy-Winkler framework for distribution-oriented forecast verification is recommended as a standard practice. This framework examines aspects of forecast quality, such as reliability, resolution, association, or discrimination, and analyzes the joint distribution of forecasts and observations, which contains all time-independent information relevant to verification. To verify forecasts, one can use any graphical display or mathematical/statistical measure to provide insights and summarize the aspects of forecast quality. The majority of graphical methods and accuracy measures known to solar forecasters are specific methods under this general framework. Additionally, measuring the overall skillfulness of forecasters is also of general interest. The use of the root mean square error (RMSE) skill score based on the optimal convex combination of climatology and persistence methods is highly recommended. By standardizing the accuracy measure and reference forecasting method, the RMSE skill score allows-with appropriate caveats-comparison of forecasts made using different models, across different locations and time periods."
1342,I,"The cutting of silicon wafers using multi-diamond wire sawing is a critical stage in solar cell manufacturing due to brittleness of silicon. Improving the cutting process output requires an in-depth understanding of phenomena associated with cutting parameters. In order to investigate the influence of diamond wire sawing on surface integrity of monocrystalline silicon, a looped diamond wire was used and cutting parameters wire cutting speed, feed rate and wire tension were varied. The surface morphology was observed by scanning electron microscopy. Surface roughness S-a was measured with a non-contact profilometer. The brittle-ductile transition was identified by presence of residual phases on sawn surface. A bevel-polishing method was employed to determine the microcrack depth. The results show that with higher feed rate the surface presents deeper and wider craters because of deeper penetration of diamond grain. On increasing wire cutting speed, there were more regions formed in ductile mode. The higher S-a values was observed on increasing both feed rate and wire tension, while S-a decreased with an increase in wire cutting speed. The brittle mode was predominant with an increase in feed rate, resulting in Si-I phase in regions formed in fragile mode. Material removal in ductile mode led to appearance of a-Si phase at high wire cutting speed. No significant effect was observed on increasing wire tension. Subsurface microcracks mainly initiating from bottom of grooves generated by cutting mechanism. The most appropriate set of cutting parameters is the lowest feed rate and wire tension and highest wire cutting speed."
1343,I,"A quick-scan yield prediction method has been developed to assess rooftop photovoltaic (PV) potential. The method has three main parts. For each roof, first (i) virtual 3D roof segments were reconstructed using aerial imagery, then, (ii) PV modules were automatically fitted onto roof segments using a fitting algorithm and finally, (iii) expected annual yield was calculated. For each roof, the annual yield was calculated by three different quick yield calculation approaches. Two approaches are commercial software packages of Solar Monkey (SM) and Photovoltaic Geographical Information System (PVGIS) whereas the other one is the simplified skyline-based approach developed in photovoltaic material and devices (PVMD) group of Delft University of Technology. To validate the quick-scan method, a set of 145 roofs and 215 roof segments were chosen in urban areas in the Netherlands. For the chosen roofs, the number of fitted modules and calculated yield were compared with the actual modular layout and the measured yield of existing PV systems. Results showed a satisfactory agreement between the quick-scan yield prediction and measured annual yield per roof, with relative standard deviations of 7.2%, 9.1%, and 7.5% respectively for SM, PVGIS, and PVMD approaches. It was concluded that the obstacle-including approaches (e.g. SM and PVMD) outperformed the approaches which neglect the shading by surrounding obstacles (e.g. PVGIS). Results also showed that 3D roof segments had added value as input for the quick-scan PV yield prediction methods since the precision of yield prediction was significantly lower using only 2D land register data of buildings."
1344,I,"Sheet resistance losses and local defects are challenges faced in solar module fabrication and upscaling processes. Commonly used investigation tools are non-invasive optical and thermal imaging techniques, such as electroluminescence, photoluminescence as well as illuminated and dark infrared imaging. Here, we investigate the potential of computationally efficient finite element simulation of solar cells and modules by considering planar electrodes coupled by a local current-voltage coupling law. Sheet resistances are determined by fitting current simulation results of an OPV solar cell to electroluminescence imaging data. Moreover, a thermal model is introduced that accounts for Joule heating due to an electrothermal coupling. A direct comparison of simulated temperature maps to measured infrared images is therefore possible. The electrothermal model is successfully validated by comparing measured and simulated temperature profiles across four interconnected organic solar cells of a mini-module. Furthermore, the influence of shunts on the thermal behavior of OPV modules is investigated by comparing electrothermal simulation results to dark lock-In IR thermography images."
1345,I,"Temperature control in solar collectors is a nonlinear problem: the dynamics of temperature rise vary according to the fluid flowing through the collector and to the temperature gradient along the collector area. In this way, this work investigates the formulation of a Model Predictive Control (MPC) application developed within a Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) formalism, which serves as a model of the solar collector process. The proposed system is an adaptive MPC, developed with terminal set constraints and considering the scheduling polytope of the model. At each instant, two Quadratic Programming (QPs) programs are solved: the first considers a backward horizon of N steps to find a virtual model-process tuning variable that defines the best LTI prediction model, considering the vertices of the polytopic system; then, the second QP uses this LTI model to optimize performances along a forward horizon of N steps. The paper ends with a realistic solar collector simulation results, comparing the proposed MPC to other techniques from the literature (linear MPC and robust tube-MPC). Discussions regarding the results, the design procedure and the computational effort for the three methods are presented. It is shown how the proposed MPC design is able to outrank these other standard methods in terms of reference tracking and disturbance rejection."
1346,I,"New renewable energy infrastructure is essential to deliver net zero policies in response to climate change, but a lack of community acceptance is a potential barrier. It is therefore important to understand what shapes community acceptance and identify policy responses. This paper presents a case study of community acceptance of a large-scale solar farm in the UK, the first to be classified as 'nationally significant' infrastructure. In doing so, it provides the first empirical study of community acceptance of a large-scale solar farm in a developed country context, building on existing studies which use hypothetical approaches such as choice experiments, or surveys which measure general attitudes rather than responses to specific developments. The paper uses mixed methods (quantitative content analysis of online comments on the planning proposal; qualitative semi-structured interviews with local residents and key stakeholders; and participant observation) to identify determinants shaping community acceptance of large-scale solar farms. We discover 28 determinants which we group into eight categories: aesthetic, environmental, economic, project details, temporal, social, construction and process. We argue that these findings help to reveal broader issues underlying community acceptance of solar farms and other renewable energy infrastructure: 'green-on-green' tensions; issues of scale and place attachment; policy, process and justice. We also contribute a novel understanding of community acceptance as 'relational', by which we mean it is informed by the deployment of other energy technologies and the wider energy policy landscape, not just the specific project. We conclude with recommendations for how policymakers can respond to the issues identified by this article."
1347,I,"The temperature regulation of photovoltaic (PV) modules using passive approach with phase-change materials (PCMs) has fascinated many researchers now-a-days. This article presents real-time experimental investigation of PV panels with PCM under warm climate of Taxila, Pakistan in two phases. In first phase, effect of fins inserted into PCM, is examined by varying number of fins as 2, 5, 8 and 11. Due to improved heat conduction within PCM through metal contact, PV cell temperature lowered by maximum 22.9 degrees C, 23.7 degrees C, 24.1 degrees C, 24.9 degrees C and 26.5 degrees C with finless, 2 -fin, 5 -fin, 8 -fin and 11-fin PV/PCM configurations respectively, improving electrical conversion efficiency from 10.2% to 10.9%, 11.3%, 11.6%, 11.8% and 12.2% respectively. In second phase, effect of using 2 PCMs of different melting points, separated by finned-aluminum plate, is investigated and compared with one PCM for PV cooling. It is found that one PCM configuration is more efficient than two PCM configurations as cell temperature lowers on average by 9.7 degrees C, 7.9 degrees C and 7 degrees C with one PCM configuration and two different configurations (i.e. different order) of 2 PCMs respectively. Electrical power output also enhances by 13.3%, 8.8%, and 7.8% respectively. 2-PCM configurations shows better performance than 1-PCM configuration in case only when it is compared to 1-PCM configuration having PCM of higher melting point. Order of PCMs has no significant effect on PV-performance."
1348,I,"The study deals with the application of retro-reflective (RR) and angular-selective retro-reflective (AS-RR) coatings on surfaces (i.e. the street ground and the south-exposed facade) within the urban canyon. Solar analyses were conducted at different latitudes (Oslo, Milan, and Cairo) by varying the urban canyon height-to-width ratio (H/W) to determine the variation in solar irradiation absorbed by north and south facades. Both summer and winter conditions were considered, and up to five material patterns (one reference case and four enhanced scenarios) were investigated for each combination of latitude and height-to-width ratio values. A validated Monte Carlo-based numerical model was used to conduct full-ray tracing analyses and to simulate the behavior of these coatings. The outcomes allowed the development of guidelines for the adoptions of RR and AS-RR materials in different scenarios. It was demonstrated that RR and AS-RR materials applied to the street performed better in low-density urban environment (H/W <= 0.5) with a consequent increase of the solar energy gains on the north facade by up to 15%. Employing RR and AS-RR materials on the south-exposed facade showed greater effectiveness on high-density urban canyon (H/w >= 2.0) and reduced by up to -8% the solar irradiation absorbed by the facade."
1349,I,"This work presents an innovative indirect supercritical CO2 - air driven concentrated solar power plant with a packed bed thermal energy storage. High supercritical CO2 turbine inlet temperature can be achieved, avoiding the temperature limitations set by the use of solar molten salts as primary heat transfer fluid. The packed bed thermal energy storage enables the decoupling between solar irradiation collection and electricity production, and it grants operational flexibility while enhancing the plant capacity factor. A quasi steady state thermoeconomic model of the integrated concentrating solar power plant has been developed. The thermo-economic performance of the proposed plant design has been evaluated via multi-objective optimizations and sensitivity analyses. Results show that a Levelized Cost of Electricity of 100 $/MWhe and a capacity factor higher than 50% can be achieved already at a 10 MWe nominal size. Such limited plant size bounds the capital investment and leads to more bankable and easily installable plants. Results also show that larger plants benefit from economy of scale, with a 65 $/MWhe cost identified for a 50 MWe plant. The receiver efficiency is found to be the most influential assumption. A 20% decrease of receiver efficiency would lead to an increase of more than 15% of the Levelized Cost of Electricity. These results show the potential of indirect supercritical CO2 - air driven concentrated solar power plant and highlight the importance of further air receiver development. More validations and verification tests are needed to ensure the system operation during long lifetime."
1350,I,"Solar thermal power plants coupled to supercritical CO2 cycles seems to be a way to increase the global solar-toelectric efficiency. For that, the concentrating solar technology that is best integrated is the molten salt central receiver with a thermal energy storage associated. This work is focused on one of the main challenges of this scheme: the source heat exchanger transferring the thermal energy from the molten salt in the solar field to the CO2 in the power cycle. A new design, based on the printed circuit heat exchanger technology is proposed, that withstands the pressure difference and avoids the molten salt plugging when circulating through microchannels. The thermo-mechanic model of this heat exchanger is also calculated. This work also addresses a thermo-economic optimization of the printed circuit heat exchanger proposed. For that, it is considered the global performance of the solar thermal plant for three layouts: recompression, intercooling and partial-cooling cycles. This optimization yields to a great reduction in the investment cost of these source heat exchangers, achieving the lowest cost in the partial-cooling configuration, followed by the intercooling and finally, the recompression. This trend is also observed in the global performance of the solar plant, so the partial-cooling layout is the one with the lowest levelized cost of electricity; this value is similar to that of the intercooling layout, and both are well below from the cost in the recompression layout, which results the most expensive configuration."
1351,I,"Information about the orientation (i.e. tilt and azimuth angles) of PV modules is a fundamental input for PV performance studies. However, this type of metadata is difficult to obtain for distributed in-use PV systems, which considerably impedes monitoring and diagnostics of PV systems and power grid management. Recently proposed parameterization methods to derive PV tilt and azimuth have limited practical applicability because they rely on data that is often not accessible. Hence, the aim of this research is to develop a novel method to infer tilt and azimuth angles of distributed PV systems, utilizing widely available data. The proposed method, which is based on a curve-matching procedure, is designed to be scalable because it only requires PV generation data and off-site irradiance data at a 1-hour time interval. The accuracy of this method has been tested using notional PV systems with a wide variety of orientations, as well as with data from real PV roofs distributed across the Netherlands. These tests show that the proposed method can parameterize azimuth and tilt angles of PV panels as far as 195 km away from the irradiance measurement site with mean absolute errors of 4.5 degrees and 4.3 degrees respectively. A demonstration case of the proposed approach written in Python is uploaded online for other researchers to use."
1352,I,"Thermal energy storage systems are integrated in concentrating solar power plants to improve the flexibility of the electricity generation. Commonly, the liquid storage material Solar Salt, a nitrate salt mixture, is applied to transport and store solar thermal energy. The lifetime and the temperature range of Solar Salt in the storage units are restricted by decomposition reactions of the material. Oxide ion formation is one of the fundamental issues. So far, it has not been proven if oxide ion formation can be prevented by addition of gaseous reaction products to the gas atmosphere. Also, a reliable reaction equation for the oxide ion formation is missing. In the presented experiments, molten salt at 600 and 620 degrees C is purged with a gas mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, and nitrous gases. Post-analysis of salt samples reveals stabilizing effects, depending on the purge gas compositions. Chemical equilibrium of the oxide ion forming reaction is demonstrated. It is proven that oxide ion formation can be controlled and suppressed. Reaction equations are evaluated and selected in order to quantify the reaction thermodynamics. The results contribute to recommendations for operating conditions and gas handling in storage systems of solar thermal power plants, which finally ensure reliable and constant material properties for extended lifetime and high temperatures."
1353,I,"Drift is a relevant issue in concentrated solar tower facilities since this time-dependent pointing error severely affects their performance. This work deals with the optical analysis of drift for tilt-roll heliostats in terms of the geometrical parameters associated to the heliostat mechanical structure and the local time. For each drift source or error, flux maps have been obtained by means of Monte Carlo ray-tracing calculations as a function of the source magnitude and daily time in winter and summer solstices. Then the corresponding pointing errors and the drift curves are determined from the displacement of the center of gravity of the flux maps. As a result, drift related to each source is identified and characterized. Additionally, drift sources are compared in terms of the standard deviation and the mean of their daily pointing errors. The analysis evidences that main drift sources are the misalignments of the pedestal like the one of an inclination with respect to the zenith."
1354,J,"Excited-state intramolecular proton transfer involves a photochemical isomerization and creates the opportunity for the emission of two distinct wavelengths of light from a single fluorophore. The selectivity between these two wavelengths of emission is dependent on the environment around the fluorophore and suggests the possibility for ratiometric monitoring of protein microenvironments. Unfortunately, nonspecific binding of ESIPT fluorophores does not often lead to dramatic changes in the ratio between the two wavelengths of emission. A protein binding pocket was designed to selectively discriminate between the two channels of emission available to an ESIPT fluorophore. This work is significant because it demonstrates that specific interactions between the protein and the fluorophore are essential to realize strong ratiometric differences between the two possible wavelengths of emission. The design strategies proposed here lead to an ESIPT fluorophore that can discern subtle differences in the interface between two proteins."

This chemical tool can be used to detect the change in free heme induced in human skin cells upon exposure to UVA irradiation."
1356,J,"The fluorination of 3-acetyl-2-oxindoles with N-fluorobenzenesulfonimide under Lewis acid catalysis using Mg(ClO4)(2) gives the starting compounds 3-acetyl-3-fluoro-2-oxindoles. These compounds are subjected to base-promoted deacylative alkylation (DaA) for the in situ generation of 3-fluoro-2-oxindole enolates under very mild reaction conditions using Triton B (1 equiv.) and alkyl halides and Michael acceptors as electrophilic reagents. The corresponding 3-alkylated-3-fluoro-2-oxindoles are obtained in good to very high yields. In addition, the palladium-catalyzed deacylative allylation is carried out with allylic alcohols using LiOtBu as the base and 6 mol% of Pd(OAc)(2) and dppp, giving the resulting 3-allylated 3-fluoro-2-oxindoles in good yields. This methodology allows a simple synthesis of 3-alkylated-3-fluoro-2-oxindoles, which are difficult to obtain by other routes."
1357,J,"Over the past three decades, a wide range of pyrene-functionalized oligonucleotides have been developed and explored for potential applications in material science and nucleic acid diagnostics. Our efforts have focused on their possible use as components of Invader probes, i.e., DNA duplexes with +1 interstrand zipper arrangements of intercalator-functionalized nucleotides. We have previously demonstrated that Invader probes based on 2-O-(pyren-1-yl)methyl-RNA monomers are energetically activated for sequence-unrestricted recognition of chromosomal DNA targets under non-denaturing conditions. As part of ongoing efforts towards delineating structure-property relationships and optimizing Invader probes, we report the synthesis and biophysical characterization of oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ONs) modified with 2-O-(7-neo-pentylpyren-1-yl)methyl-uridine monomer V and 2-O-(7-tert-butyl-1-methoxypyren-5-yl)methyl-uridine monomer Y. ONs modified with monomer V display increased DNA affinity (T-m up to +10.5 degrees C), while Y-modified ONs display lower DNA affinity and up to 22-fold increases in fluorescence emission upon RNA binding. Although these monomers display limited potential as building blocks for Invader probes, their photophysical properties render them of interest for diagnostic RNA-targeting applications."
1358,J,"This work reports a computational study of the copper(i)-catalyzed regioselective synthesis of indolizine derivatives through the [3 + 2]-cyclization reaction of vinyldiazo acetates and pyridine derivatives. This reaction is predicted to proceed via a multi-step process with the initial decomposition of the diazo function and generation of an electrophilic copper(i) carbene intermediate. Subsequent attack of the pyridine derivative at the vinylogous position of the carbene would generate a vinylcuprate intermediate that would evolve to the final products through a sequence involving cyclization, reductive elimination, metal decoordination and final oxidative aromatization. According to our calculations, an alternative pathway involving the initial activation of the pyridine seems unlikely. These theoretical results could pave the way for further developments in vinyldiazo chemistry."

1360,J,"The introduction of solid-phase peptide synthesis in the 1960s improved the chemical synthesis of both the A- and B-chains of insulin and insulin analogs. However, the subsequent elaboration of the synthetic peptides to generate active hormones continues to be difficult and complex due in part to the hydrophobicity of the A-chain. Over the past decade, several groups have developed different methods to enhance A-chain solubility. Two of the most popular methods are use of isoacyl dipeptides, and the attachment of an A-chain C-terminal pentalysine tag with a base-labile 4-hydroxymethylbenzoic acid linker. These methods have proven effective but can be limited in scope depending on the peptide sequence of a specific insulin. Herein we describe an auxiliary approach to enhance the solubility of insulin-based peptides by incorporating a tri-lysine tag attached to a cleavable Fmoc-Ddae-OH linker. Incorporation of this linker, or """"helping hand"""", on the N-terminus greatly improved the solubility of chicken insulin A-chain, which is analogous to human insulin, and allowed for coupling of the insulin A-and B-chain via directed disulfide bond formation. After formation of the insulin heterodimer, the linker and tag could be easily removed using a hydrazine buffer (pH 7.5) to obtain an overall 12.6% yield based on A-chain. This strategy offers an efficient method to enhance the solubility of hydrophobic insulin-based peptides as well as other traditionally difficult peptides."

The free-base isocorrole ligands could all be complexed to copper with Cu(OAc)(2)H2O in chloroform/methanol in 55-80% yields. Single-crystal X-ray structures of two of the new compounds (H-2[5-pyr-TpOMePiC] and Cu[10-pyr-TpOMePiC]) revealed planar macrocycles with rms atomic displacements of only 0.02 and 0.06 angstrom relative to their respective best-fit C19N4 planes. Both free-base and Cu(ii)-complexed isocorroles exhibit richly featured UV-vis-NIR spectra with red/NIR absorption maxima at approximate to 650 nm and approximate to 725 nm for the free-bases and approximate to 800-850 nm for the copper complexes, suggesting potential applications in photodynamic therapy. Cyclic voltammetric analyses of five of the Cu complexes revealed fully reversible redox cycles with multiple oxidation and reduction features."
1368,J,"The capacity of hydrazone bonds to readily undergo component exchange processes sees their extensive utilization in dynamic combinatorial chemistry. The kinetics of hydrazone exchange are optimal at pH approximate to 4.5, which limits the use of hydrazone-based dynamic combinatorial libraries, particularly for biological targets which are only stable at near-neutral pH values. It would thus be advantageous if hydrazone exchange proceeded with faster rates at pH values closer to neutral. We experimentally and computationally evaluated the hypothesis that hydrazones possessing neighbouring acidic or basic functional groups within the carbonyl-derived moitety of the hydrazone would enhance exchange rates. Our work suggests that judiciously placed N- or O-hydrogen bond acceptors within the carbonyl-derived moiety of the hydrazone stabilize transition states via hydrogen bonding interactions, providing a valuable boost to exchange kinetics at near-neutral pH values. We anticipate these findings will be of interest in dynamic combinatorial chemistry, dynamic covalent polymers/materials, functionalized nanoparticles and interlocked molecules, all of which may benefit from hydrazone exchange processes able to operate at near-neutral pH values."
1369,J,"Despite their importance in biology and medicinal chemistry, structural and functional studies of membrane proteins present major challenges. To study diverse membrane proteins, it is crucial to have the correct detergent to efficiently extract and stabilize the proteins from the native membranes for biochemical/biophysical downstream analyses. But many membrane proteins, particularly eukaryotic ones, are recalcitrant to stabilization and/or crystallization with currently available detergents and thus there are major efforts to develop novel detergents with enhanced properties. Here, a novel class of trehalose-cored amphiphiles are introduced, with multiple alkyl chains and carbohydrates projecting from the trehalose core unit are introduced. A few members displayed enhanced protein stabilization behavior compared to the benchmark conventional detergent, n-dodecyl--d-maltoside (DDM), for multiple tested membrane proteins: (i) a bacterial leucine transporter (LeuT), (ii) the R. capsulatus photosynthetic superassembly, and (iii) the human (2) adrenergic receptor ((2)AR). Due to synthetic convenience and their favourable behaviors for a range of membrane proteins, these agents have potential for membrane protein research. In addition, the detergent property-efficacy relationship discussed here will guide future design of novel detergents."
1370,J,"An active segment of the research community designing small molecules (minimalist mimics of peptide fragments) to interfere with protein-protein interactions have based their studies on an implicit hypothesis. Here we refer to this as the Secondary Structure Hypothesis, that might be defined as, If a small molecule can orient amino acid side-chains in directions that resemble side-chains of the parent secondary structure at the interface, then that small molecule is a candidate to perturb the protein-protein interaction. Rigorous tests of this hypothesis require co-crystallization of minimalist mimics with protein receptors, and comparison of the bound conformations with the interface secondary structures they were designed to resemble. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, there is no such analysis in the literature, and it is unlikely that enough examples will emerge in the near future to test the hypothesis. Research described here was designed to challenge this hypothesis from a different perspective. In a previous study, preferred conformations of a series of novel minimalist mimics were simulated then systematically overlaid on >240000 crystallographically characterized protein-protein interfaces. Select data from that overlay procedure revealed chemotypes that overlay side chains on various PPI interfaces with a relatively high frequency of occurrence. The first aim of this work was to determine if good secondary structure mimics overlay frequently on PPI interfaces. The second aim of this work was to determine if overlays of preferred conformers at interface regions involve secondary structures. Thus situations where these conformations overlaid extremely well on PPI interfaces were analyzed to determine if secondary structures featured the PPI regions where these molecules overlaid in the previous study. Combining conclusions from these two studies enabled us to formulate a hypothesis that is complementary to the Secondary Structure Hypothesis, but, unlike this, is supported by abundant data. We call this the Interface Mimicry Hypothesis."
1371,J,Herein we describe the direct enantioselective Lewis base/Pd catalysed alpha-allylation of pyrrole acetic acid esters. This provides high isolated yields of highly enantioenriched products and exhibits broad reaction scope with respect to both reaction partners. The products can be readily elaborated in a manner which points towards potential applications in target directed synthesis.
1372,J,"Herein we report synthesis of complex heparan sulfate oligosaccharide precursors by automated glycan assembly using disaccharide donor building blocks. Rapid access to a hexasaccharide was achieved through iterative solid phase glycosylations on a photolabile resin using Glyconeer (TM), an automated oligosaccharide synthesiser, followed by photochemical cleavage and glycan purification using simple flash column chromatography."
1373,J,The direct decarboxylative azidation of cyclic a-amino acids has been achieved via visible light-mediated organo-photoredox catalysis. This synthetic strategy allows the simple preparation of azide-contaning building blocks and has been used in the selective modification of N-terminal proline residues of two di-peptides.
1374,J,"We investigated 26 midsized peptides (similar to 30 amino acids in length) selected using mRNA display to perform a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction (SNAr). Analysis suggested a diverse set of reactive sequences with significant differences in primary sequence, secondary structure and even predicted tertiary structural features. Several of the sequences displayed rapid kinetics allowing for near complete labeling in under one hour. Rosetta ab initio structure prediction of these sequences suggested a landscape of structural features, ranging from beta-sheet-based sequences to those possessing more alphahelical- like character. Circular dichroism spectroscopy confirmed elements of the structure predictions for the majority of peptides. This analysis additionally uncovered that several peptides underwent secondary structure alterations upon reaction. These results suggest a broad sequence and structural landscape of SNAr active peptides along with a potentially important feature of these biopolymers."
1375,J,"Ligase-catalyzed oligonucleotide polymerisations (LOOPER) can readily generate libraries of diversely-modified nucleic acid polymers, which can be subjected to iterative rounds of in vitro selection to evolve functional activity. While there exist several different DNA ligases, T4 DNA ligase has most often been used for the process. Recently, T3 DNA ligase was shown to be effective in LOOPER; however, little is known about the fidelity and efficiency of this enzyme in LOOPER. In this paper we evaluate the efficiency of T3 DNA ligase and T4 DNA ligase for various codon lengths and compositions within the context of polymerisation fidelity and yield. We find that T3 DNA ligase exhibits high efficiency and fidelity with short codon lengths, but struggles with longer and more complex codon libraries, while T4 DNA ligase exhibits the opposite trend. Interestingly, T3 DNA ligase is unable to accommodate modifications at the 8-position of adenosine when integrated into short codons, which will create challenges in expanding the available codon set for the process. The limitations and strengths of the two ligases are further discussed within the context of LOOPER."
1376,J,"Linear peptide amphiphiles are excellent biocompatible scaffolds for the hierarchical self-assembly of one-dimensional nano-structures in aqueous media. However, their structural exploration and screening of self-assembling properties are often limited by time-consuming synthesis and purification steps. We here describe the application of an oxime bond as a powerful synthetic tool towards the conjugation of peptide heads bearing a hydroxylamine group with hydrophobic aldehyde tails. This methodology allowed the quick preparation of a small library of oxime-connected peptide amphiphiles, whose supramolecular screening revealed nano-to-micro-fibrillation with dependency on their chemical structure. These results demonstrate the simplicity and the synthetic potential of the oxime conjugation for the preparation of peptide amphiphiles with improved self-assembling capabilities."
1377,J,"Monoclonal antibodies have emerged as an important class of therapeutics in oncological and autoimmune diseases due to their several attractive properties, such as high binding affinity and specificity. However, it has recently become clear that antibodies recovered from serum show a significantly decreased potency owing to various reasons, including deamidation, oxidation, fragment antigen binding (Fab) exchange, and disulfide shuffling. Fab exchange and disulfide shuffling result because of the instability of disulfides in serum. Herein, we reported a 'one-pot' stapling strategy using isobutylene motifs to stabilise the interchain disulfides of antibodies. This general method was applied to a Fab fragment of the anti-HER2 antibody. The stapled Fab was completely stable in the presence of biological thiols. The approach was further applied to two different full-length IgGs, trastuzumab and rituximab, under mild and biocompatible conditions. The binding affinity of the antibody was enhanced, relative to its native form, after being stapled. The stapled structure maintained its effector functions and behaved similarly to its native form in vivo. This work provides a straightforward and scalable method for the stabilisation of antibodies in various formats."
1378,J,"Bromodomain and PHD finger containing protein transcription factor (BPTF) is an epigenetic protein involved in chromatin remodelling and is a potential anticancer target. The BPTF bromodomain has one reported small molecule inhibitor (AU1, rac-1). Here, advances made on the structure-activity relationship of a BPTF bromodomain ligand are reported using a combination of experimental and molecular dynamics simulations leading to the active enatiomer (S)-1. Additionally, a ligand deconstruction analysis was conducted to characterize important pharmacophores for engaging the BPTF bromodomain. These studies have been enabled by a protein-based fluorine NMR approach, highlighting the versatility of the method for selectivity, ligand deconstruction, and ligand binding. To enable future analysis of biological activity, cell growth analyses in a panel of cancer cell lines were carried out using CRISPR-Cas9 and (S)-1 to identify cell-based model systems that are sensitive to BPTF inhibition."
1379,J,C-Terminal dipeptide isopropenyl esters were synthesised by a Cu(II)-mediated Chan-Lam-Evans enol esterification of peptide carboxylic acids and isoprenyl boroxine. These shelf stable peptide esters could be coupled stereoselectively with a variety of amino acid and dipeptide nucleophiles in high yield and purity in the presence of pyrazole/DBU as the catalyst.
1380,J,"Herein we report the synthesis of fluorescent, glycosylated 4-amino-1,8-naphthalimide (Nap) 1, and the related 1,8-naphthalimides Troger's bases (TBNap) 2 and 3, from 1,8-naphthalic anhydride precursors, the a-mannosides being introduced through the use of CuAAC mediated 'click' chemistry. We investigate the photophysical properties of these probes in buffered solution and demonstrate their ability to function as fluorescent probes for Concanavalin A (Con A) lectin. We show that both the Nap and TBNap structures self-assemble in solution. The formation of the resulting supramolecular structures is driven by head-to-tail p-p stacking and extended hydrogen bonding interactions of the Nap and the triazole moieties. These interactions give rise to spherical nano-structures (ca. 260 nm and 100 nm, for 1 and 3, respectively), which interact with the Con-A protein, the interaction being probed by using both luminescent and Scanning Electron Microscopy imaging as well as dynamic light scattering measurements. Finally, we show that these supramolecular assembles can be used as luminescent imaging agents, through confocal fluorescence imaging of HeLa cells of the per-acetylated version 2."
1381,J,"N-Methylation of DNA/RNA bases can be regulatory or damaging and is linked to diseases including cancer and genetic disorders. Bacterial AlkB and human FTO are DNA/RNA demethylases belonging to the Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate oxygenase superfamily. Modelling studies reveal conformational dynamics influence structure-function relationships of AlkB and FTO, e. g. why 1-methyladenine is a better substrate for AlkB than 6-methyladenine. Simulations show that the flexibility of the double stranded DNA substrate in AlkB influences correlated motions, including between the core jelly-roll fold and an active site loop involved in substrate binding. The FTO N-and C-terminal domains move in respect to one another in a manner likely important for substrate binding. Substitutions, including clinically observed ones, influencing catalysis contribute to the network of correlated motions in AlkB and FTO. Overall, the calculations highlight the importance of the overall protein environment and its flexibility to the geometry of the reactant complexes."
1382,J,"Phenols are extremely valuable building blocks in the areas of pharmaceuticals, natural products, materials and catalysts. In order to carry out modifications on phenols, the phenolic oxygen is routinely protected to prevent unwanted side reactions. Presently many of the protecting groups available can require harsh conditions, specialist equipment, expensive or air/moisture-sensitive reagents to install and remove. Here we introduce the use of the tetrafluoropyridyl (TFP) group as a general protecting group for phenols. TFP can be installed in one step with no sensitivity to water or air, and it is stable under a range of commonly employed reaction conditions including acid and base. The TFP protecting group is readily cleaved under mild conditions with quantitative conversion to the parent phenol, observed in many cases in less than 1 hour."
1383,J,"To restrict pathogens, in a normal human cell, APOBEC3 enzymes mutate cytosine to uracil in foreign single-stranded DNAs. However, in cancer cells, APOBEC3B (one of seven APOBEC3 enzymes) has been identified as the primary source of genetic mutations. As such, APOBEC3B promotes evolution and progression of cancers and leads to development of drug resistance in multiple cancers. As APOBEC3B is a non-essential protein, its inhibition can be used to suppress emergence of drug resistance in existing anti-cancer therapies. Because of the vital role of APOBEC3 enzymes in innate immunity, selective inhibitors targeting only APOBEC3B are required. Here, we use the discriminative properties of wild-type APOBEC3A, APOBEC3B and APOBEC3G to deaminate different cytosines in the CCC-recognition motif in order to best place the cytidine analogue 2'-deoxyzebularine (dZ) in the CCC-motif. Using several APOBEC3 variants that mimic deamination patterns of wild-type enzymes, we demonstrate that selective inhibition of APOBEC3B in preference to other APOBEC3 constructs is feasible for the dZCC motif. This work is an important step towards development of in vivo tools to inhibit APOBEC3 enzymes in living cells by using short, chemically modified oligonucleotides."
1384,J,"Site-selective modification of peptides and proteins has resulted in the development of a host of novel tools for the study of cellular systems or the synthesis of enhanced biotherapeutics. There is a need for useful methodologies that enable site-selective modification of native peptides or proteins, which is even more prevalent when modification of the biomolecule with multiple payloads is desired. Herein, we report the development of a novel dual functional divinylpyrimidine (dfDVP) platform that enables robust and modular modification of peptides, antibody fragments and antibodies. These biomacromolecules could be easily functionalised with a range of functional payloads (e.g.fluorescent dyes, cytotoxic warheads or cell-penetrating tags). Importantly, the dual functionalised peptides and antibodies demonstrated exquisite bioactivity in a range ofin vitrocellular assays, showcasing the enhanced utility of these bioactive conjugates."
1385,J,"A BINOL-derived chiral bifunctional sulfide catalyst bearing a phenylurea moiety was applied to enantioselective bromoaminocyclization reactions of 2-allylaniline derivatives, which provide optically active 2-substituted indoline products as important motifs for biologically active compounds. A protecting group on the nitrogen of the 2-allylaniline substrate was carefully optimized, and highly enantioselective reactions were achieved by employing the p-biphenylsulfonyl-protected substrates. The origin of the good level of enantioselectivity for the present bromoaminocyclization was also investigated on the basis of DFT calculations. The resultant optically active 2-(bromomethyl)indoline products could be transformed to various 2-substituted indolines with no loss of the optical purity."
1386,J,"1,3-Dipolar dearomatizing cycloadditions between a non-stabilized azomethine ylide and 3-cyanoindoles or benzofuran afford the corresponding 3D-heterocycles bearing a quaternary carbon centre at the ring junction. While 6 equivalents of ylide precursor 1 are required for full conversion in a classical flask, working under flow conditions limits the excess (3 equiv., t (R) = 1 min) and leads to a cleaner process, affording cycloadducts that are easier to isolate."
1387,J,"UnsymmetricalE- andZ-stilbenes can be synthesized from two differently substituted benzaldehydes in a MesP(TMS)Li-promoted reductive coupling sequence. Depending on the order of addition of the two coupling partners, the same olefin can be produced in eitherE- orZ-enriched form under identical reaction conditions. A systematic study of the correlation between the stereochemical outcome of the reaction and the substitution pattern at the two aldehydes is presented. The results can be used as guidelines to predict the product stereochemistry."
1388,J,The asymmetric synthesis of the 3-allyl-3-hydroxyoxindole skeleton was accomplished in yields up to 99%viaa metal-free and enantioselective allylation of isatins (90-96% ee) using BINOL derivatives as catalysts and an optimized allylboronate. This methodology was applied at a gram-scale to the synthesis of the natural product (R)-chimonamidine.
1389,J,"High-mannose (Man(9)GlcNAc(2)) is the main carbohydrate unit present in viral envelope glycoproteins such as gp120 of HIV and the GP1 of Ebola virus. This oligosaccharide comprises the Man(9)epitope conjugated to two terminalN-acetylglucosamines by otherwise rarely-encountered beta-mannose glycosidic bond. Formation of this challenging linkage is the bottleneck of the few synthetic approaches described to prepare high mannose. Herein, we report the synthesis of the Man(9)epitope with both alpha and beta configurations at the reducing end, and subsequent evaluation of the impact of this configuration on binding to natural receptor of high-mannose, DC-SIGN. Using fluorescence polarization assays, we demonstrate that both anomers bind to DC-SIGN with comparable affinity. These relevant results therefore indicate that the more synthetically-accesible Man(9)alpha epitope may be deployed as ligand for DC-SIGN in bothin vitroandin vivobiological assays."
1390,J,"Activated aromatics were reacted with two different fluoroidoane reagents1and2in the presence of triflic acid to prepare only thepara-substituted diaryliodonium salts. With fluoroiodane1the unsymmetrical diaryliodonium salts contained anortho-propan-2-ol sidearm, whereas the alcohol sidearm was eliminated to form anortho-styrene sidearm in the reaction with fluoroiodane2. Only the diaryliodonium salts containing a styrene sidearm were fluorinated successfully to deliverpara-fluorinated aromatics in good yields."
1391,J,"Analogs of the known inhibitor (peptide pDI) of the p53/MDM2 protein-protein interaction are reported, which are stapled by linkers bearing a photoisomerizable diarylethene moiety. The corresponding photoisomers possess significantly different affinities to the p53-interacting domain of the human MDM2. Apparent dissociation constants are in the picomolar-to-low nanomolar range for those isomers with diarylethene in the """"open"""" configuration, but up to eight times larger for the corresponding """"closed"""" isomers. Spectroscopic, structural, and computational studies showed that the stapling linkers of the peptides contribute to their binding. Calorimetry revealed that the binding of the """"closed"""" isomers is mostly enthalpy-driven, whereas the """"open"""" photoforms bind to the protein stronger due to their increased binding entropy. The results suggest that conformational dynamics of the protein-peptide complexes may explain the differences in the thermodynamic profiles of the binding."
1392,J,"Significant advancements in C-N bond formationviaC-H bond functionalisation have made it a staple in the production of nitrogen-containing compounds in both industry and academia. However, transition metal-free synthesis, particularly in the case of C(sp(3))-N formation, has remained a significant challenge to the synthetic community. Herein we report a procedure for alpha-C(sp(3))-H amination of ethereal compounds through use of azodicarboxylates as the nitrogen source and freely-available atmospheric oxygen to access ethereal radical intermediatesviaaerobic C-H activation. The use of fluorinated alcohols as solvent is observed to greatly increase the efficiency of the reaction and we show experimentally and theoretically the key role of H-bonding between fluorinated alcohols and azodicarboxylates. Calculations of the condensed Fukui functions of a H-bonded fluorinated alcohol-azodicarboxylate complex correlates with a significantly increased susceptibility of azodicarboxylates to undergo reaction with radicals, which informs a number of recent reports in the literature."
1393,J,"Hybrid peptides whose N-terminal residues are activated in the form of alpha-methylisoserine-derived cyclic sulfamidates exhibit rich reactivity as electrophiles, allowing site- and stereoselective modifications at different backbone and side chain positions. The unique properties of this scaffold allow the stereocontrolled late-stage functionalization of the peptide backbone by nucleophilic ring opening with fluorescent probes, thiocarbohydrates and tags for strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition as well as by installing labile N-terminal affinity tags (biotin) and cytotoxic drugs (chlorambucil) for pH-controlled release. Finally, an unexpected base-promoted acyl group migration from the sulfamidate N-terminus allows fast and quantitative intramolecular modification of nucleophilic side chains on the fully unprotected peptides."
1394,J,"Pyrazol-3-amine is a scaffold present in a large number of compounds with a wide range of biological activities and, in many cases, the heterocycle is C4-C5 fused to a second ring. Among the different reactions used for the decoration of the pyrazole ring, Ullmann and acylation have been widely applied. However, there is some confusion in the literature regarding the regioselectivity of such reactions (substitution at N1 or N2 of the pyrazole ring) and no predictive rule has been so far established. As a part of our work on 3-amino-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridones13, we have studied the regioselectivity of such reactions in different C4-C5 fused pyrazol-3-amines. As a rule of thumb, the Ullmann and acylation reactions take place, predominantly, at the NH and non-protonated nitrogen atom of the pyrazole ring respectively, of the most stable initial tautomer (1H- or 2H-pyrazole), which can be easily predicted by using DFT calculations."
1395,J,"Methyl groups of thymine and 5-methylcytosine (5(m)C) bases in DNA undergo endogenous oxidation damage. Additionally, 5(m)C residues can be enzymatically deaminated or oxidized through either genetic alterations or the newly identified epigenetic reprogramming pathway. Several methods have been developed to measure the formation of modified DNA nucleobases including(32)P-postlabeling. However, the postlabeling method is often limited by the absence of authentic chemical standards. The synthesis of monophosphate standards of nucleotide oxidation products is complicated by the presence of additional functional groups on the modified bases that require complex protection and deprotection strategies. Due to the emerging interest in the pyrimidine oxidation products, the corresponding protected 3 '-phosphoramidites needed for solid-phase oligonucleotide synthesis have been reported, and several are commercially available. We report here an efficient synthesis of 3 '-monophosphates from 3 '-phosphoramidites and the subsequent enzymatic conversion of 3 '-monophosphates to the corresponding 5 '-monophosphates using commercially available enzymes."
1396,J,"Thiazoles and benzothiazoles undergo regioselective C2-H chalcogenationviathe sequence of thiazole C2-functionalization with phosphines to produce phosphonium salts which in turn react with S- and Se-centered nucleophiles to give products of C2-H chalcogenation and allow for recovery of the starting phosphine. The atom economical sequence proceeds under mild conditions and features broad scope for both the nucleophiles (electron-rich, electron-poor, sterically hindered thiols) and the various substituted benzothiazoles. The access to the substituted medicinally relevant C2-thio benzothiazoles also enables stereoselectivity improvements in the modified Julia olefinations."
1397,J,"Ever since the discovery of fullerenes, their mono- and multi-functionalization by exohedral addition chemistry has been a fundamental topic. A few years ago, a topochemically controlled regiospecific difunctionalization of C-60 fullerene by anthracene in the solid state was discovered. In the present work, we analyse the mechanism of this unique reaction, where an anthracene molecule is transferred from one C-60 mono-adduct to another one, under exclusive formation of equal amounts of C-60 and of the difficult to make, highly useful, antipodal C-60 bis-adduct. Our herein disclosed dispersion corrected DFT studies show the anthracene transfer to take place in a synchronous retro Diels-Alder/Diels-Alder reaction: an anthracene molecule dissociates from one fullerene under formation of an intermediate, while undergoing stabilizing interactions with both neighbouring fullerene molecules, facilitating the reaction kinetically. In the intermediate, a planar anthracene molecule is sandwiched between two neighbouring fullerenes and forms equally strong 'double-decker' type pi-pi stacking interactions with both of these fullerenes. Analysis with the distortion interaction model shows that the anthracene unit of the intermediate is almost planar with minimal distortion. This analysis highlights the existence of simultaneous noncovalent interactions engaging both faces of a planar polyunsaturated ring and two convex fullerene surfaces in an unprecedented 'inverted sandwich' structure. Hence, it sheds light on new strategies to design functional fullerene based materials."
1398,J,DNA-organized multi-chromophoric systems containing phenanthrene and pyrene derivatives exhibit a highly efficient excitation energy transfer from phenanthrene (donor) to pyrene (acceptor). The energy transfer also occurs if the phenanthrene antenna is interrupted by intervening DNA base pairs. Artificial light-harvesting complexes composed of up to five phenanthrene-DNA alternations with fluorescence quantum yields as high as 68% are described.
1399,J,"N-Methyl-beta-carboline (beta C) alkaloids, including normelinonine F (1b) and melinonine F (2b), have been found in a vast range of living species playing different biological, biomedical and/or pharmacological roles. Despite this, molecular bases of the mechanisms through which these alkaloids would exert their effect still remain unknown. Fundamental aspects including the photosensitizing properties and intracellular internalization of a selected group of N-methyl-beta C alkaloids were investigated herein. Data reveal that methylation of the beta C main ring enhances its photosensitizing properties either by increasing its binding affinity with DNA as a biomolecular target and/or by increasing its oxidation potential, in a structure-dependent manner. As a general rule, N(9)-substituted beta Cs showed the highest photosensitizing efficiency. With the exception of 2-methyl-harminium, all the N-methyl-beta Cs investigated herein induce a similar DNA photodamage profile, dominated largely by oxidized purines. This fact represents a distinctive behavior when comparing with N-unsubstituted-beta Cs. On the other hand, although all the investigated compounds might accumulate mainly into the mitochondria of HeLa cells, methylation provides a distinctive dynamic pattern for mitochondrial uptake. While rapid ( passive) diffusion is most probably reponsible for the prompt uptake/release of neutral beta Cs, an active transport appears to mediate the (reatively slow) uptake of the quaternary cationic beta Cs. This might be a consequence of a distinctive subcellular localization (mitochondrial membrane and/or matrix) or interaction with intracellular components. Biomedical and biotechnological implications are also discussed herein."
1400,J,The uptake and metabolism of the disaccharide trehalose by Mycobacterium tuberculosis is essential for the virulence of this pathogen. Here we describe the chemoenzymatic synthesis of new azido-functionalised asymmetric trehalose probes that resist degradation by mycobacterial enzymes and are used to probe trehalose processing pathways in mycobacteria.
1401,J,"A major current issue in medicinal chemistry is the design of small peptide analogues resistant to proteolysis and able to adopt preferential conformations, while preserving the selectivity and efficiency of natural peptides. Whereas the introduction of one aza-Gly in peptides has proven numerous biological and structural interest, the conformational effect of sequential aza-Gly or azaamino acids bearing side chains has not been investigated. In this work, experimental NMR and X-ray data together with in silico conformational studies reveal that the introduction of two consecutive aza-amino acids in pseudotripeptides induces the formation of stable hydrogen-bonded beta-turn structures. Notably, this stabilization effect relies on the presence of side chains on azaamino acids, as more flexible conformations are observed with aza-Gly residues. Remarkably, a longer aza/aza/alpha/aza/aza/alpha pseudohexapeptide containing substituted aza-amino acids adopts repeated beta-turns conformations which interconvert with a fully helical structure mimicking a 3(10) helix."
1402,J,"The enzyme protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) is essential for the correct folding of proteins and the activation of certain cell surface receptors, and is a promising target for the treatment of cancer and thrombotic conditions. A previous high-throughput screen identified the commercial compound STK076545 as a promising PDI inhibitor. To confirm its activity and support further biological studies, a resynthesis was pursued of the reported beta-keto-amide with anN-alkylated pyridone at the alpha-position. Numerous conventional approaches were complicated by undesired fragmentations or rearrangements. However, a successful 5-step synthetic route was achieved using an aldol reaction with an alpha-pyridone allyl ester as a key step. An X-ray crystal structure of the final compound confirmed that the reported structure of STK076545 was achieved, however its lack of PDI activity and inconsistent spectral data suggest that the commercial structure was misassigned."
1403,J,"Photocleavage from polystyrene beads is a pivotal reaction for solid phase synthesis that relies on photolabile linkers. Photocleavage from intact porous polystyrene beads is not optimal because light cannot penetrate into the beads and the surface area exposed to irradiation is limited. Thus, hazardous, technically challenging and expensive setups are used for photocleavage from intact beads. We developed a new concept in which grinding the beads during or prior to irradiation is employed as an essential part of the photocleavage process. By grinding the beads we are exposing more surface area to the light source, hence, photocleavage can be performed even using a simple benchtop LED setup. This approach proved very efficient for photocleavage of various model compounds including fully protected oligosaccharides."
1404,J,"Isotopologs are powerful tools for investigating biological systems. We report a biosynthetic-cascade synthesis of Trp isotopologs starting from indole, glycine, and formaldehyde using the enzymesl-threonine aldolase and an engineered beta-subunit of tryptophan synthase. This modular route to Trp isotopologs is simple and inexpensive, enabling facile access to these compounds."
1405,J,"Triazolium iodide salts are excellent catalysts for the selective oxidative coupling of benzylamines to yield imines. This metal-free reaction proceeds in quantitative spectroscopic yields when run in refluxing 1,2-dichlorobenzene and open to the air. No catalytic activity was observed with related triazolium tetrafluoroborate salts. Variation of catalyst and reaction atmosphere provides mechanistic insights, and revealed dioxygen as the terminal oxidant and the iodine/iodide couple as key redox component in the catalytic dehydrogenation pathway. While molecular iodine is competent as a catalyst in its own right, the triazolium cation triples the reaction rate and reaches turnover frequencies up to 30 h(-1), presumably through beneficial interactions of the electron-poor azolium pi system and I-2, which facilitate the electron transfer from the substrate to iodine and concomitant formation of I-. This acceleration is specific for triazolium cations and represents a hybrid anion/cation catalytic process as a simple and straightforward route towards imine products, with economic advantages over previously reported metal-based catalytic systems."
1406,J,"In this work we report a computational study about the aza-SNAr mechanism in fluorine- and chlorine-containing azines with the aim to unravel the physical factors that determine the reactivity patterns in these heterocycles towards propylamine. The nature of the reaction intermediate was analyzed in terms of its electronic structure based on a topological analysis framework in some non-stationary points along the reaction coordinate. The mechanistic dichotomy of a concerted or a stepwise pathway is interpreted in terms of the qualitative Diabatic Model of Intermediate Stabilization (DMIS) approach, providing a general mechanistic picture for the SNAr process involving both activated benzenes and nitrogen-containing heterocycles. With the information collected, a unified vision of the Meisenheimer complexes as transition state, hidden intermediate or real intermediate was proposed."
1407,J,"Novel water-soluble, deca-substituted pillar[5]arenes containing thiasulfate and thiacarboxylate fragments were synthesized and characterized. UV-vis, 2D H-1-H-1 NOESY and DOSY NMR spectroscopy revealed the ability of pillar[5]arenes containing thiasulfate fragments to form an inclusion complex with cholecalciferol (vitamin D-3) in a 1 : 2 ratio (lg K-ass = 2.2). Using DLS and SEM it was found that upon concentration and/or evaporation of the solvent, the supramolecular polymer (pillar[5]arene/vitamin D-3 (1 : 2)) forms a porous material with an average wall diameter of 53 nm. It was shown that the supramolecular polymer is stable during photolysis by UV radiation (k(1) = 1.7 x 10(-5) s(-1))."
1408,J,"The actinoallolides are a family of polyketide natural products isolated from the bacteriumActinoallomurus fulvus. They show potent biological activity against trypanosomes, the causative agents of the neglected tropical diseases human African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) and Chagas disease, while exhibiting no cytotoxicity against human cell lines. Herein, we give a full account of our strategy evolution towards the synthesis of this structurally unique class of 12-membered macrolides, which culminated in the first total synthesis of (+)-actinoallolide A in 20 steps and 8% overall yield. Subsequent late-stage diversification then provided ready access to the congeneric (+)-actinoallolides B-E. Enabled by this flexible and efficient endgame sequence, we also describe the design and synthesis of a photoaffinity probe based on actinoallolide A to investigate its biological mode of action. This will allow ongoing labelling studies to identify their protein binding target(s)."
1409,D,"Using longitudinal survey data from northern Ethiopia collected over 18 months, this study shows that conclusions about household food security are highly sensitive to measurement decisions. Especially important are 1) decisions about which food security indicators and cut-offs are chosen, and 2) whether analysis focuses on food security status at a given point in time or food security resilience over time. We define resilience as the probability that a household is truly above a chosen food security cut-off, given its underlying assets, demographic characteristics, and past food security status. Our study finds that different factors determine food security status and food security resilience. We also find that the drivers of resilience vary depending on whether food security is measured by Food Consumption Score (FCS) or the reduced Coping Strategies Index (rCSI). Literacy and livestock holdings are associated with both FCS status and FCS resilience, and the latter is also predicted by access to safe water and sanitation, the dependency ratio, and debt. In contrast, only previous rCSI scores predict current rCSI status, while marital status, literacy, livestock, and other forces matter for determining rCSI resilience. We also find that conclusions about food security resilience are sensitive to the cut-offs chosen to signify a food secure state."
1410,D,"The development of a comparative food policy research agenda has been hampered by the dependent variable problem of how to delineate the policy field. Through a concise literature review, we show that the existing literature has conceptualised food policy as policy outputs, institutional orders, or discursive constructs. Focusing on the policy outputs, we define food policy as a set of policy outputs adopted to address one or more food system activities (production, processing and packaging, distribution and retailing, and consumption) with the explicit aim of affecting food system outcomes in a desired direction. The paper develops a heuristic encompassing four dimensions along which food policy outputs may differ: (i) policy scope, (ii) targeting of policy efforts, (iii) type of policy instruments applied and how these are calibrated, and (iv) integration of the various components of the policy complex. These four dimensions can be applied to characterise individual food policies and compare across countries and time. Comparing and tracking the development of food policy along these dimensions would allow for addressing follow-up questions about impacts and what explains policy change."
1411,D,"India is home to nearly 200 million undernourished people, yet little is known about the characteristics of those experiencing food insecurity, especially among urban households. The objectives of this study were: (1) to report the prevalence of food insecurity in two large, population-based representative samples in urban India, (2) to describe socio-economic correlates of food insecurity in this context, and (3) to compare the dietary intake of adults living in food insecure households to that of adults living in food secure households. Data are from 4334 households participating in an ongoing population-based cohort study of a representative sample of Delhi and Chennai, India. The most recent wave of data (2017-2018) were analyzed. Food insecurity was measured using the 9-item Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) and dietary intake using a 33-item qualitative food frequency questionnaire. The overall prevalence of food insecurity was 8.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.8-10.2); 15.2% (95% CI 12.0-18.4) of the poorest households (lowest wealth index tertile) were food insecure compared to 1.7% (95% CI 1.0-2.3) of the wealthiest households (highest wealth index tertile). Participants experiencing food insecurity were significantly younger and more likely to be from Delhi compared to Chennai. After adjustment for socio-economic factors (city, age, sex, education, wealth index, fuel used for cooking, and source of drinking water), participants experiencing food insecurity had significantly higher meat, poultry, roots and tubers (potato), and sugar sweetened beverage intakes, and lower vegetables, fruit, dairy, and nut intakes. Food insecurity is highly prevalent among the poorest households in urban India and is associated with intake of a number of unhealthy dietary items."
1412,D,"The widespread prevalence of nutrient deficiency and poor nutritional outcomes has been a significant concern in developing and emerging countries like Nepal. The level of diversity in household diets is an indirect measure of diet quality and the extent to which nutritional needs of households are being met. However, there is a limited understanding on the trends, patterns and determinants of the dietary diversity in Nepal. This study is an attempt to enrich the literature on this issue. Based on unit level data from three rounds (1995, 2004, and 2011) of the Nepal Living Standard Survey (NLSS), we used multilevel modeling, quantile regression, and the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition method to decipher the trends, determinants and drivers of dietary diversity in Nepal. Our study finds that the changes in household socio-demographic and agricultural characteristics are very important in explaining the improvement in dietary quality. Changes in household characteristics account for at least 37% of the observed improvement and agriculture-related changes explain at least 16% of the observed improvement. Our findings are highly robust across the different model specifications and concludes by bringing a focus on multi-sectoral approach to tackle nutrition issues in Nepal."
1413,D,"The objective of this cross-sectional study was to assess the relationship between food insecurity and depression in the Mexican population. We used data from the 2012 health and nutrition survey (ENSANUT), which is representative of the Mexican population. Food insecurity was determined by the Latin American and Caribbean Food Security Scale (ELCSA). Depressive symptoms were evaluated using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale Short-Form (CES-D-SF). Adjusted logistic regression analyses and ANCOVA were used. Out of 33,011 participants, 5788 (18%) had high depressive symptoms and 24,098 (73%) experienced food insecurity. The adjusted logistic regression analysis showed that, participants with mild food insecurity, (OR = 1.47,95% CI = 1.27 to 1.71), moderate food insecurity (OR = 2.14,95% CI = 1.85 to 2.47) and severe food insecurity (OR = 3.01,95% CI = 2.51 to 3.60,) were more likely to have high depressive symptoms than food secure participants. Participants with moderate food insecurity (OR =1.45, 95% CI = 1.28 to 1.64) and severe food insecurity (OR =2.04, 95% CI = 1.76 to 2.37) were more likely to suffer from depression as compared to participants with mild food insecurity. Participants with severe food insecurity were more likely (OR=1.41, 95% CI = 1.21 to 1.65) to suffer from depression compared to participants with moderate food insecurity. This paper provides an overview of the complex problem of food insecurity and mental health. Despite the unknown causality, the analysis suggests a strong association between depression and food insecurity. This problem calls for much more attention from the scientific community. Given the high prevalence of depression and the high prevalence of household food insecurity in Mexico, the implementation of successful public health programs to improve food security is necessary."
1414,D,"Our understanding and prevention of postharvest losses are critical if we are to feed a growing global population. Insect infestation-related losses of stored commodities are typically considered only in terms of quantitative, physical weight loss. Insect infestation affects the nutritional value and some nutritional components are impacted more severely than others. We infested maize and cowpea grain with commonly occurring stored product insect pests, and mapped infestation levels against nutritional composition over a 4-to-6 month storage period to analyse how insect infestation relates to different macro- and micro-nutrient contents. Insect infestation decreased the carbohydrate content of the stored grains, causing a relative increase in the proportion of protein and fibre in the remaining grain, and moisture content also increased. Sitophilus zeamais preferentially fed in the floury endosperm of maize, resulting in more carbohydrate loss relative to protein loss. Conversely, Prostephanus truncatus consumed the germ and endosperm, disproportionately reducing the fat, protein, iron and zinc grain contents. Nutrients are distributed more homogenously within cowpea than in maize grains, but Callosobruchus maculatus infestation increased the relative protein, fat, iron and zinc to carbohydrate ratios. This indicates how the nutrient content of insect-infested stored grain depends upon the grain type, the infesting insect, and the infestation level. Insect infestation therefore has consequences for human nutrition beyond those of grain weight loss. Using data collected on the changing nutritional composition of grain over time, with and without insect infestation, we modelled the associations between infestation and nutritional quality to predict estimated nutritional losses that could be associated with consumption of insect-infested stored maize and cowpea."
1415,D,"Few longitudinal studies link agricultural biodiversity, land use and food access in rural landscapes. In this paper, we test the hypothesis that, in a context of economic change, cash crop expansion is associated with deforestation, reduced agrobiodiversity and changes in food access. For this purpose, we analysed data collected from the same 53 upland and floodplain mestizo households in Ucayali, Peru, in 2000 and 2015. We found an emerging transition towards less diversified food access coupled with loss of forest cover and reduced agricultural biodiversity. In 2015, diets appeared to rely on fewer food groups, fewer food items, and on products increasingly purchased in the market compared to 2000. Wild fruits and plants were mentioned, but rarely consumed. Agricultural production systems became more specialised with a shift towards commercial crops. Peak deforestation years in the 15-year period appeared linked with incentives for agricultural expansion. Our results suggest an overall trend from diversified productive and """"extractive"""" systems and more diverse food access, towards specialized productive systems, with less diverse food access and stronger market orientation (both in production and consumption). The assumption in the food and agricultural sciences that increased income and market-orientation is linked to improved food security, is challenged by our integrated analyses of food access, agrobiodiversity, land use and forest cover. Our results highlight the importance of longitudinal, multidimensional, systemic analyses, with major implications for land use, food and health policies. The potential risks of parallel homogenisation of diets and agricultural production systems require interdisciplinary research and policies that promote integrated landscape approaches for sustainable and inclusive food systems."
1416,D,"In southern Africa the repeated cultivation of maize (Zea mays) and climate variability (especially frequent and extended droughts) have created conditions favouring parasitic weed infestation (e.g., Striga asiatica). In the past decade, Striga has reduced maize yields for smallholder farmers (cultivating less than two hectares), not only in southern Africa, but across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Parasitism of maize by Striga leads to significant grain yield losses. Intercropping legumes within maize-based systems has been shown to decrease Striga infestation and improve food security. Before cultivating these cropping systems, farmers consider different attributes associated with them (e.g., efforts or cost of inputs). Understanding farmers' preferences for these attributes generates insights as how to increase adoption of intercropping as a Striga control practice. We use discrete choice experiments to identify the trade-offs which Malawian farmers are willing to accept among the attributes of choice scenarios for Striga control practices. Results indicate that farmers are willing (and in some cases unwilling) to sacrifice different fractions of maize yield for suppression of Striga, labour intensity, soil fertility and intercropped legume yield. Male and female farmers have heterogeneous preferences for these attributes. These findings have significant implications for Striga management and its effect on a crop that sustains the livelihoods of more than 80% of Malawians."
1417,D,"Genebanks play an essential role in a world where agricultural biodiversity has been lost from farming habitats, malnutrition persists as global population continues to rise, and farm productivity is vulnerable to climate change. We demonstrate the importance of the genebank of the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) to the development of seven iron-biofortified varieties of climbing bean and the impact of their adoption on farm households in Rwanda. First, we link iron-biofortified varieties of climbing beans directly to the genebank through pedigree analysis and key informant interviews with the breeders who developed them. Second, we apply various econometric models to test the impact of adoption on yield, consumption, and purchase of beans by farming households in Rwanda, building upon previous research on bush beans. We based the analysis on a dataset of nearly 1400 households, collected in 2015 by HarvestPlus. We found that the scope of the genetic diversity housed in the bean collection at CIAT was fundamental to developing successful iron-biofortified beans. We found significant positive effects of climbing varieties on yields; however, we did not find significant effects on the amounts of beans consumed by households or bean purchases. Our results suggest that it is possible to trace the journey of an accession from its introduction in the genebank to its final use by farmers and consumers. Positive effects on yield generate incentives for adoption of iron-biofortified bean varieties, potentially boosting micronutrient consumption. Further research is needed to understand the factors affecting the adoption and impacts of climbing bean varieties."
1418,D,"Large-scale agricultural investments in land and biofuel feedstock production have been found to lead to positive employment, growth and poverty reduction effects. However, these outcomes depend on the institutional context and the type of investment. This article aims to provide insights into the relationship between wage work for a large-scale Jatropha project and household food security, measured as dietary diversity and food provision during the lean season. After the initial hype and the subsequent downfall of Jatropha, new projects are still being undertaken. Yet there is little evidence quantifying the long-term impacts of large-scale Jatropha production on smallholders' livelihoods. This article addresses the gap by using five rounds of panel data collected between 2008 and 2013 from 390 randomly selected households in the vicinity of a Jatropha project in Madagascar. Labour demand by the plantation declined substantially after the build-up phase, and incomes from wage work were mostly used for food and other necessities. Impacts were estimated with the help of fixed effects models. Jatropha wage work contributed significantly to dietary diversity but did not reduce the more subjective lack of food during the lean season. One reason might be that households stored significantly less rice over time. Moreover, food production and consumption were highly influenced by seasonality, drought and locust shocks, which implies that complementing income creation with agricultural development strategies might have further positive effects on livelihoods and food security."
1419,D,"Food security is usually identified as a desirable outcome depending on a variety of factors such as food availability, access and distribution. Food self-sufficiency is one of the key factors when it comes to evaluating food availability. Furthermore, food self-sufficiency is not only a national concern but also relevant on a sub-national scale. A consumption-oriented approach is proposed to measure the degree of self-sufficiency on a regional scale. In our proposal, exports are subtracted from domestic supply to assess the share of domestic production in domestic consumption. By doing so, the effects of regional specialization in export crops on our estimates are avoided. Due to its increasing relevance in consumption patterns, the food industry is included as a separate group of food items. Owing to their small size, high density of human activities, specialization in tourism, and remoteness from the European continent, the Canary Islands are an interesting laboratory for illustrating the advantages and shortcomings of measuring food self-sufficiency on a local scale."
1420,D,"Weather risk is a serious issue in the African small farm sector that will further increase due to climate change. Farmers typically react by using low amounts of agricultural inputs. Low input use can help to minimize financial loss in bad years, but is also associated with low average yield and income. Increasing small farm productivity and income is an important prerequisite for rural poverty reduction and food security. Crop insurance could incentivize farmers to increase their input use, but indemnity-based crop insurance programs are plagued by market failures. This article contributes to the emerging literature on the role of weather index insurance (WII). We use data from a survey of farmers in Kenya, where a commercial WII scheme has been operating for several years. Regression models with instrumental variables are used to analyze WII uptake and effects on input use and crop productivity. Results show that WII uptake is positively and significantly associated with the use of chemical fertilizer and improved seeds, and also with crop yield. We conclude that upscaling WII programs may help to spur agricultural development in the small farm sector."
1421,D,"This paper investigates the associations between crop and income diversity and dietary diversity among men, women, adolescents, and children of farmer households in India. We examine crop, income, and dietary data collected from 1106 farmer households across Gujarat and Haryana, two states that represent different livelihood transition pathways in India. Regression results suggest that crop diversity had a positive association with dietary diversity among adults (both men and women) in both states, and among adolescents and children in Haryana. Higher family education and annual income were the two most important factors associated with higher dietary diversity score (DDS) in Gujarat whereas, higher family education, greater crop diversity, and increased distance traveled to markets were the most important factors associated with higher individual DDS in Haryana. Specifically, for children, crop diversity emerged as one of the most important factors associated with dietary diversity in both states. Interestingly, we find that even in these two relatively prosperous states, the pathways to dietary diversity vary across sites and within households, suggesting that policies to improve dietary diversity should be tailored to a given location and context."
1422,D,"Edible insects have been advocated as a means to combat food insecurity, which is prevalent in West Africa. In this study we look at the contribution of the shea caterpillar Cirina butyrospermi, colloquially known as 'chitoumou', to the food security of smallholder households in rural southwestern Burkina Faso. We used a mixed methods approach to understand the relationship between caterpillar collection, consumption, and sale by smallholder households, and their seasonal food security status. We found that caterpillars are an important source of food and income for households, significantly increasing the household consumption of animal protein and, with shea nuts, representing the main income source for the majority of women. We also found that food security is higher during caterpillar season, and that household-level food security during this season can be predicted by the amount of caterpillars collected, consumed and sold. However, this relationship holds only during the caterpillar season, suggesting that the positive impact of caterpillars on food security is temporally limited. We conclude that the shea caterpillar is an example of an edible insect that is crucial for seasonal food security in a widespread agricultural system."
1423,D,"While urban indoor farming is a fairly new phenomenon, there is a growing interest from producers, authorities and consumers alike. However, many assumptions are made, and expectations held, about urban indoor farming from a sustainability, food production and food provisioning point of view. These assumptions and expectations need to be tested and assessed. This study assessed greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and a number of social aspects of a newly established indoor urban farm in Stockholm. The farm was the result of a project created by commercial, civil society and municipal actors with the aim to make use of unused urban space, create jobs and produce food. While lettuce grown on the indoor farm emitted more GHG than lettuce cultivated outdoors in Sweden, it was more climate friendly than imported lettuce in our comparison. Furthermore, the indoor farm created value for the actors involved and for the city district, albeit on a small scale. Many of the positive environmental and social features owed to the small scale of the indoor farm and the context in which it developed. Thus, when evaluating production systems like this one, we need to be cautious and refrain from extrapolating the results."
1424,D,"Agriculture in South Africa sustains about 70% of the region's population for food, income and employment, playing an important role for food security and the local economy. The focus of the study was the commercial maize farms of the Free State Province given their importance in the National economy. The Regional Integrated Assessment (phase I) was implemented to assess climate change and adaptation that links climate, crops, economic data and tools developed by the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP). In this context, the """"system"""" is defined as a whole of agronomic and socio-economic factors. Within that framework three core questions were being evaluated: (i) Impacts of climate change under current system; (ii) Impacts of climate change under future system; (iii) The role of adaptation under climate change and the future system. Maize production will decrease between 10% to 16% as a result of projected climate impacts. Also, current agricultural production systems are negatively affected by climate change with an increase in poverty rates between 2% to 3%. The projected adoption of the adapted technology would result in positive increased net returns and a decrease in poverty rate of between 12% and 22%. The results of this study show that implementing adaptation measures, including strategies indicated by the local stakeholders, will have positive impacts on the agricultural production systems and can contribute to support and inform climate change policy decision making such as the development of National Adaptation Plans."
1425,D,"New challenges have arrived for the conservation of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture. Increased pressure on the environment, including the added threat of climate change, has had adverse effects on biodiversity and agricultural systems. Emerging science and new technologies have at the same time altered the scope of possibilities for collection, conservation, and utilization of genetic resources for agriculture. Taken together, these changes imply a need for a refocusing of global strategies for the management of genetic resources for agriculture. This paper argues that simple theoretical models provide relatively little guidance for key questions about genebank management. The fundamental uncertainty of scientific possibility and global futures makes it challenging - and perhaps futile - to attempt economic valuation of gene banks. A more useful application of economic tools will be in the prioritization of collection and conservation. Economic analysis may also offer useful insights into the efficient management of genetic resources."
1426,H,"In this paper, we establish an integral identity associated with m-times differentiable functions. The result is then used to derive some integral estimations for higher-order strongly n-polynomial preinvex functions. Finally, we apply the obtained inequalities to construct new inequalities involving special means."
1427,H,"In this paper, as a generalization of the concepts of hesitant fuzzy bi-ideals and hesitant fuzzy right (resp. left) ideals of semigroups, the concepts of hesitant fuzzy (m, n)-ideals and hesitant fuzzy (m, 0)-ideals (resp.

Moreover, several correspondences between bi-ideals (right ideals, left ideals) and hesitant fuzzy (m, n)-ideals ((m, 0)-ideals, (0, n)-ideals) are obtained. Also, the characterizations of different classes of semigroups in terms of their hesitant fuzzy (m, n)-ideals and hesitant fuzzy (m, 0)-ideals ((0, n)-ideals) are investigated."
1428,H,"The problem of energy crisis and environmental pollution has been mitigated by the generation and use of wind power; however, the choice of locations for wind power plants is a difficult task because the decision-making process includes political, socioeconomic, and environmental aspects. Thus, several adverse consequences have been created by the choice of suboptimal locations. The objective of this paper is to address the integrated qualitative and quantitative multicriteria decision-making framework for the selection of wind power plant locations. Spherical fuzzy sets are the latest extension of the ordinary fuzzy sets. The main characteristic of the spherical fuzzy sets is satisfying the condition that the squared sum of the positive, neutral, and negative grades must be at least zero and at most one. In this research, we establish novel operational laws based on the Yager t-norm and t-conorm under spherical fuzzy environments (SFE). Furthermore, based on these Yager operational laws, we develop list of novel aggregation operators under SFE. In addition, we design an algorithm to tackle the uncertainty to investigating the best wind power plant selection in four potential locations in Pakistan. A numerical example of wind power plant location problem is considered to show the supremacy and effectiveness of the proposed study. Also, a detailed comparison is constructed to evaluate the performance and validity of the established technique."
1429,H,"The theory of convex functions plays an important role in engineering and applied mathematics. The Caputo-Fabrizio fractional derivatives are one of the important notions of fractional calculus. The aim of this paper is to present some properties of Caputo-Fabrizio fractional integral operator in the setting of h-convex function. We present some new Caputo-Fabrizio fractional estimates from Hermite-Hadamard-type inequalities. The results of this paper can be considered as the generalization and extension of many existing results of inequalities and convex functions. Moreover, we also present some application of our results to special means of real numbers."
1430,H,Transformations of differential equations to other equivalent equations play a central role in many routines for solving intricate equations. A class of differential equations that are particularly amenable to solution techniques based on such transformations is the class of linearisable second-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs). There are various characterisations of such ODEs. We exploit a particular characterisation and the expanded Lie group method to construct a generic solution for all linearisable second-order ODEs. The general solution of any given equation from this class is then easily obtainable from the generic solution through a point transformation constructed using only two suitably chosen symmetries of the equation. We illustrate the approach with three examples.
1431,H,"So far, most of the researchers developed one type of estimator in nonparametric regression. But in reality, in daily life, data with mixed patterns were often encountered, especially data patterns which partly changed at certain subintervals, and some others followed a recurring pattern in a certain trend. The estimator method used for the data pattern was a mixed estimator method of smoothing spline and Fourier series. This regression model was approached by the component smoothing spline and Fourier series. From this process, the mixed estimator was completed using two estimation stages. The first stage was the estimation with penalized least squares (PLS), and the second stage was the estimation with least squares (LS). Those estimators were then implemented using simulated data. Thesimulated data were gained by generating two different functions, namely, polynomial and trigonometric functions with the size of the sample being 100. The whole process was then repeated 50 times. The experiment of the two functions was modeled using a mixture of the smoothing spline and Fourier series estimators with various smoothing and oscillation parameters. The generalized cross validation (GCV) minimum was selected as the best model. The simulation results showed that the mixed estimators gave a minimum (GCV) value of 11.98. From the minimum GCV results, it was obtained that the mean square error (MSE) was 0.71 and R-2 was 99.48%. So, the results obtained indicated that the model was good for a mixture estimator of smoothing spline and Fourier series."
1432,H,"In this paper, we will introduce the definition of operator (p, eta)-convex functions, we will derive some basic properties for operator (p, eta)-convex function, and also check the conditions under which operations' function preserves the operator (p, eta)-convexity.

1433,H,"In this paper, bounds of fractional and conformable integral operators are established in a compact form. By using exponentially convex functions, certain bounds of these operators are derived and further used to prove their boundedness and continuity. A modulus inequality is established for a differentiable function whose derivative in absolute value is exponentially convex. Upper and lower bounds of these operators are obtained in the form of a Hadamard inequality. Some particular cases of main results are also studied."
1434,H,"A word is a finite sequence of symbols. Parikh matrix of a word is an upper triangular matrix with ones in the main diagonal and nonnegative integers above the main diagonal which are counts of certain scattered subwords in the word. On the other hand, a picture array, which is a rectangular arrangement of symbols, is an extension of the notion of a word to two dimensions. Parikh matrices associated with a picture array have been introduced, and their properties have been studied. Here, we obtain certain algebraic properties of Parikh matrices of binary picture arrays based on the notions of power, fairness, and a restricted shuffle operator extending the corresponding notions studied in the case of words. We also obtain properties of Parikh matrices of arrays formed by certain geometric operations."

Furthermore, we obtain a lattice isomorphism between the class of fuzzy deductive systems and the class of fuzzy congruence relations in the variety of Hilbert algebras."

For the practical application of the Sawi decomposition method, an advance problem of medical science for determining the blood glucose concentration during an intravenous injection has been considered and solved sequentially applying this method. Results of numerical problems depict that the Sawi decomposition method is a very effective decomposition method for determining the primitives of V.I.E."

Moreover, the frame operator for the DTW frame is obtained. Finally, we discuss dual pair of frames for discrete time Wilson systems and give a sufficient condition for their existence."
1442,H,"In this paper, the authors determine the number of infected cells and concentration of infected (viral) particles in plasma during HIV-1 (human immunodeficiency virus type one) infections using Shehu transformation. For this, the authors first defined some useful properties of Shehu transformation with proof and then applied Shehu transformation on the mathematical representation of the HIV-1 infection model. The mathematical model of HIV-1 infections contains a system of two simultaneous ordinary linear differential equations with initial conditions. Results depict that Shehu transformation is very effective integral transformation for determining the number of infected cells and concentration of viral particles in plasma during HIV-1 infections."
1443,H,"The study focuses on the chaotic behavior of a three-dimensional Hopfield neural network with time delay. We find the aspecific coefficient matrix and the initial value condition of the system and use MATLAB software to draw its graph. The result shows that their shape is very similar to the figure of Rosler's chaotic system. Furthermore, we analyzed the divergence, the eigenvalue of the Jacobian matrix for the equilibrium point, and the Lyapunov exponent of the system. These properties prove that the system does have chaotic behavior. This result not only confirms that there is chaos in the neural networks but also that the chaotic characteristics of the system are very similar to those of Rosler's chaotic system under certain conditions. This discovery provides useful information that can be applied to other aspects of chaotic Hopfield neural networks, such as chaotic synchronization and control."
1444,H,"In this note, we show that, for any f is an element of Z[x] and any prime number p, there exists g is an element of[Zx] for which the polynomial f(x) - g(x)(p) is irreducible over Q. For composite p >= 2, this assertion is not true in general. However, it holds for any integer p >= 2 if f is not of the form ah(x)(k), where a not equal 0 and k >= 2 are integers and h is an element of Z[x]."
1445,D,"The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of complex interactions among household and environmental-level factors on household-level food availability via a simulation model, the Food Accessibility Agent-based Model in Central Columbus, Ohio (FAAMC) and to test impacts of novel interventions for reducing disparities in food availability. FAAMC simulates food shopping patterns of households based on the actual location of homes and food stores, transportation network, household income, vehicle ownership, and distance to food stores. Policy interventions, which were evaluated as single or combined interventions, included: (1) reducing preference for convenience stores/partial markets; (2) increasing food availability in stores; and (3) increasing household income through a guaranteed basic income supplement program. The FAAMC estimated that mean food availability for food insecure households is 23% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 22-24%) lower than for food secure households. Increasing household income among the poorest households may lead to a 14% (95% CI: 13-18%) increase in monthly food availability for food insecure households. Implementing multiple interventions would lead to a 41% (95% CI: 40-43%) increase in monthly food availability among food insecure households. This study exemplifies how a systems science approach may serve as an effective and efficient tool for evaluating What if? scenarios for improving household-level food security."
1446,D,"Aflatoxins are carcinogenic, toxic and immunosuppressive substances produced by some species of the fungal genus, Aspergillus. Consumption of aflatoxins can have serious health effects. Widespread in the tropical and sub-tropical world, aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is found in many staple foods and feeds; after ingestion it is metabolized to aflatoxin M1 (AFM1), which transfers to milk. One option for reducing aflatoxin concentration in cow milk is addition of mycotoxin binders to animal feeds, but little is known about this practice in the smallholder dairy systems in developing countries. We undertook a study to investigate the availability and use of mycotoxin binders in selected urban and peri-urban areas of Kenya. Data were collected using key informant interviews with government officials and one-to-one questionnaire-guided interviews with agrovet outlets (shops that sell animal health products (such as antibiotics) and crop inputs (such as fertilizers) and feed processors. Nine different mycotoxin binder types were reported. They were sold by 8% (4/49) of agrovets and 33% (3/9) of feed processors. The binders were purchased by farmers formulating their own feeds and by feed processors. Our review of regulations found that incorporating binders into animal feeds is not mandatory and there are no specific standards governing their use in Kenya. Feed processors are expected to respect the maximum allowable limit of 5g/kg for AFB1 in complete feeds. Gaps in the local feed supplies that may potentially lead to increased risks of aflatoxin exposure through milk are discussed. This study provides key data on the availability and local use of mycotoxin binders, which were previously lacking. However, there is a need for continued research on their effectiveness in the local smallholder context, in order to promote their appropriate use."
1447,D,"Much attention has been devoted in the literature to the analysis of price transmission along food supply chains. Price transmission analysis has traditionally focused on applying econometric methods to assess price dynamics and interrelationships. However, the exclusive application of econometric methods without considering the market's institutional context has limited potential to support evidence-based policy-making. In recent years, studies have thus attempted to combine the use of quantitative and qualitative methods to better understand the level of performance of food value chains. This study contributes to broadening these empirical toolkits by suggesting a structured analytical framework that benefits from the simultaneous application of econometric and market-structure methods in price transmission analysis. To illustrate the application of the framework, we analyzed the milk market of Panama."
1448,D,"Due to negative consequences of climate change for agriculture and food production shocks affecting different areas of the world, the past two decades saw the conditions of global food security increasingly worsen. This has resulted in negative consequences for the world economy, partly causing international food price spikes and social upheavals. In this paper we present statistical findings along with a preliminary version of an original agent-based model called the Dawe Global Security Model that simulates the global food market and the political fragility of countries. The model simulates the effects of food insecurity on international food prices and how these, coupled with national political fragility and international food trade can, in turn, increase the probability of food riots in countries. The agents in the model are the 213 countries of the world whose characteristics reflect empirical data and the international trade of food is also simulated based on real trade partnerships and data. The model has been informed, calibrated and validated using real data and the results of these procedures are presented in the paper. To further test the model we also present the model's forecasts for the near future in terms of food prices and incidence of food riots. The Dawe Global Security Model can be used to test scenarios on the evolution of shocks to global food production and analyse consequences for food riots. Further developments of the model can include national responses to food crises to investigate how countries can influence the spread of global food crises."
1449,D,"Ten percent of the world's population depends on the ocean for a readily accessible source of protein and employment. Coastal ecosystems and the communities that rely upon them are facing extreme challenges of increases in ocean pollution, loss of habitat, ocean warming, and changes in ocean productivity. With the whole system under mounting pressure, governments need to scale down food security analyses to the coastal community level to avoid overseeing rising levels of food insecurity. This paper provides an alternative view and analysis of food security at both a national and community level taking into account these marginalised communities. The results propose a refined definition of marine food security and new quantitative methods to measuring direct and indirect reliance on fish within developing countries. Application of this concept and methods reveals that aggregated national statistics mask the extreme levels of dependence on fish for food security in coastal communities within Kenya and Madagascar. The Comoros, Mauritius, Mozambique, and Somalia appear to be the most vulnerable to increasing sea surface temperature, population, and fluctuation in total catch and will be severely affected by a changing Western Indian Ocean from a national, community, and individual perspective. Overall, the study highlights that governments need to disaggregate fisheries data and redefine measurements of food security to more accurately reveal the severity of the potential marine food insecurity crisis at hand."
1450,D,"Maternal and child under-nutrition resulting in childhood stunting remains prevalent in east Africa, leading to increased disease risk, limiting cognitive development, and impeding human capital accumulation that constrains individuals, communities, and nations from reaching their full potential. In a western Kenyan population with a high prevalence of childhood stunting, frequency of milk consumption has been shown to increase monthly height gain in children, indicating the potential to improve health through livestock productivity. However, calving rates remain low, constraining the availability of milk to the household. Here we model average herd-level calving intervals and its relation to milk yield and nutrition in the context of an agricultural household production model, applying a dynamic panel econometric approach to household level data. We provide evidence that targeted on-farm specialization leads to significantly higher calving rates and shorter calving intervals, which in turn predictably increase milk production. Importantly, we show that the positive link between calving and household milk nutrition is present across households that primarily consume milk produced on-farm (""""producer-consumers"""") and those that predominantly purchase milk (""""milk buyers""""), indicating that efforts to improve herd fertility in western Kenya could improve food security on a community scale."
1451,D,"Using survey dataset collected from nearly 9000 farmers along with pedigree and evaluation data, this study measures the contribution of the International Rice Genebank (IRG) to varietal improvement and rice productivity of farmers in Eastern India. We empirically test the relationship of ancestry to productivity changes while controlling for the effects of other farm inputs and environmental factors. Estimated coefficients indicate that a 10% increase in the genetic contribution of IRG accessions to an improved rice variety is associated with a yield increase of 27%. Through pedigree analysis, we also confirm that 45 to 77% of the genetic composition of improved rice varieties is derived from the genes of IRG accessions. Peta, Dee Geo Woo Gen, and Fortuna are the three most popular progenitors with definite IRG contribution. High genealogical diversity likely results from the crossing of germplasm received from multiple countries of origin, which also confer multiple, functional trait combinations in a released variety. Further, our calculations reveal that the average coefficient of parentage of all pairwise combinations among the 10 most adopted rice varieties is 0.0973, indicating a high degree of latent genetic diversity. Findings demonstrate the valuable contribution of the genetic resources conserved and distributed by IRG to the development of improved rice varieties."
1452,D,"The Covid19 pandemic should be seen as a wake-up call for humanity, to reflect, rethink and redesign food systems that are safe, healthy, sustainable, and beneficial to all. This crisis has disrupted food supply chains, affecting lives and livelihoods. Hunger and malnutrition is expected to increase and the poor and vulnerable will suffer the most. There is urgent need to build resilient food systems. A location specific farm-system-for-nutrition approach, based on sustainable use of natural resources and local agri-food value chains can help improve household diet diversity and address nutrition deficiencies. The food-based approach can improve preparedness and resilience of communities to withstand the challenge posed by crises in general, and COVID19 in particular."
1453,I,"Electroluminescence (EL) imaging is a useful modality for the inspection of photovoltaic (PV) modules. EL images provide high spatial resolution, which makes it possible to detect even finest defects on the surface of PV modules. However, the analysis of EL images is typically a manual process that is expensive, time-consuming, and requires expert knowledge of many different types of defects. In this work, we investigate two approaches for automatic detection of such defects in a single image of a PV cell. The approaches differ in their hardware requirements, which are dictated by their respective application scenarios. The more hardware-efficient approach is based on hand-crafted features that are classified in a Support Vector Machine (SVM). To obtain a strong performance, we investigate and compare various processing variants. The more hardware-demanding approach uses an end-to-end deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that runs on a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). Both approaches are trained on 1968 cells extracted from high resolution EL intensity images of mono- and polycrystalline PV modules. The CNN is more accurate, and reaches an average accuracy of 88.42%. The SVM achieves a slightly lower average accuracy of 82.44%, but can run on arbitrary hardware. Both automated approaches make continuous, highly accurate monitoring of PV cells feasible."
1454,I,"A direct steam generation (DSG) solar collector can be an efficient process-heat application compared to electricity generation, and it can significantly reduce dependence on non-renewable energy sources for steam generation. Due to intermittency of the sun, thermal energy storage is required to increase the capacity factor or the yearly utilization of the system. For this study, phase change material (PCM) is used to store the heat from the steam produced in the solar collector. Sodium formate is selected as the PCM material on a cost basis. A detailed off-design analysis is carried to predict the annual performance of the system. Fins are used to enhance the thermal performance of the PCM, and an simplified method is derived to predict the required fin mass. With an increase in the number of fins, the thermal performance of the system increases significantly at design point. But the fins are expensive, so an annual simulation and techno-economic analysis is carried to calculate the optimal number of fins and other operating parameters. For the case study of Imperial, California (USA), the minimum value of the levelized cost of heat (LCOH) for steam generation is 4.2 cents/kWh(th), and the optimal value for the equivalent PCM thermal conductivity is 1.5 W/mK with 4 h of storage and a solar multiple of 2.1. A sensitivity of LCOH with the solar installation cost shows that the collector cost should be less than 220 $/m(2) for California and 103 $/m(2) for the rest of the United States, for the steam generated from DSG collector and PCM storage to be competitive with the traditionally produced steam from natural gas. Where natural gas prices are higher, steam produced from a DSG collector and PCM storage can be an economical option. For example, in Kahului, Hawaii (USA), the LCOH for steam generation from a DSG collector and PCM storage is 43% cheaper compared to natural gas steam generation, even at a current solar installation price of 300 $/m(2). The breakeven price of natural gas is 8.7 $/MMBTU for the current solar installation price; in other words, steam produced from DSG collector and PCM storage can be an economical option for locations having good solar radiation and a natural gas price greater than 8.7 $/MMBTU."
1455,I,"Although the utilization of concentrated solar power (CSP) for electricity production is already at commercial stage, the application to energy intensive industrial processes is still at an early stage. Among these, the cement industry is one of the biggest CO2-emitters and requires temperature levels achievable with concentrated solar radiation. Since fine particles have to be treated in this process, several challenges arise from the implementation of solar energy in such applications. In this work we present the design and experimental assessment of a high temperature solar rotary kiln to perform the calcination of cement raw meal. With input powers of about 14 kW, material flows of 4-12 kg/h were treated and calcination degrees ranged from 24 to 99%. The chemical efficiency was between 8 and 20% while total efficiencies (thermal plus chemical) between 19 and 40% were achieved. The creation of dust, which is a major issue with particles in the mu m-range, could be kept under control by applying a suitable suction system at the reactor aperture. The influence of the mass flow rate, residence time and kiln temperatures on the calcination were analysed to identify key points for further improvement."
1456,I,"Concentrating solar power systems (CSP) with thermal storage units can provide dispatchable power. Here we propose a modified design of a cavity receiver combined with a thermocline heat storage unit for the beam-down CSP. Instead of using a separate receiver and heat storage unit, an integrated unit consisting of an extended cylindrical cavity with a packed bed storage is proposed. The new approach was designed using validated cavity radiation and quasi-1D 2-phase numerical heat transfer models. As the concentrated irradiation can be directly absorbed in such a system, the structure used can be simplified and operation of the unit is more effective. A high solar-to-exergy conversion ratio of 0.52 was reached with an optimized design, charging and discharging efficiencies being well beyond 99% and 92% at 770 degrees C. An important detail in the integrated receiver-storage design was the use of a circulation air flow fan, which enhanced the heat transfer inside the packed bed storage. The proposed design is promising for improving the efficiency and economics of beam down CSP."
1457,I,"Dynamic control of solar thermal processes is a critical bottleneck demanding to be addressed for the development of viable alternatives to traditional industrial processes that rely on high temperature process heat from fossil fuel combustion. Current technologies possess various concentrated solar power (CSP) control strategies to compensate for natural fluctuations of solar irradiation while some of the dynamic control problems are addressed by creative reactor design to capture solar energy more efficiently. In this paper, a solar receiver with two light entry controlling aperture mechanisms is proposed as a promising control method for manipulated radiation entry into the cavity. Design and motion characteristics of these aperture mechanisms govern the amount of flux intercepted by the receiver. Performance of these apertures in maintaining semi-constant temperature inside the receiver was tested numerically and experimentally for comprehensive explanation of the physics behind the results. An optical analysis was done by implementing two different Monte Carlo Ray Tracing (MCRT) approaches for comparison and verification of complex aperture designs. Total radiative losses were determined by considering the energy balance on the quartz window by taking the spectral-dependent optical properties of the window into account. A thermal analysis was done in conjunction with the optical analysis to demonstrate thermal-optic performance of both mechanisms. A 7 kW high flux Xenon bulb was optically modeled according to experimentally obtained radiation maps. The optical model was coupled as an input to a thermal computation with lumped parameter assumption. Numerical results were validated by comparison with experimental results for both steady and dynamic responses. Estimation of a high flux scenario at steady state as well as for a given DNI pattern were numerically predicted and comparisons with conventional control methods were made. Results demonstrated the potential of the variable aperture in terms of temperature control and receiver efficiency."
1458,I,"In surrounding solar power tower plants, the collector field is designed with all the heliostats pointing to the cylindrical receiver equator to obtain maximum intercept. However, in commercial plants, the addition of thousands of energy spots at the same receiver level causes an excessively high peak heat flux of about 2 MW/m(2). Therefore, this peak flux should be almost halved to avoid receiver problems due to creep and fatigue effects. The single-parameter aiming strategy (Vant-Hull, 2002) has already shown its ability to divide this high peak flux into two lower peaks; it consists in moving the hot spots up and down from the equator, in alternative heliostat rows, to create symmetric flux maps although they are clearly not very homogeneously distributed along the receiver height. In this work, a slight variation of the single-parameter aim strategy, simply proposing two aim parameters, has been successfully tested for a commercial solar power tower plant with a regular layout. The new two-parameter aiming strategy achieves not only reasonable peak flux values, but also an acceptably flattened flux profile and a slight reduction in spillage compared with the single-parameter strategy."
1459,I,"This paper presents a novel experimental work for cooling photovoltaic panels using water saturated zeolite/activated alumina. Different system configurations, with 4 different zeolite thicknesses, were tested indoor. Moreover, the zeolite was tested with different added components (fins and metal mesh/particles) for enhancing the system performance. Three different radiations intensities were set for a period of 6 h and the results were compared with the uncooled system. The experimental results showed a significant solar panels temperature reduction of approximately 14.9 degrees C and 9 degrees C for radiation intensities of 600 and 1000 W/m(2) respectively. The expected electrical efficiency, according to this temperature reduction, was calculated and an average enhancement of 10% and 7% at radiation of 600 and 1000 W/m(2) intensity respectively was estimated."
1460,I,"The aim of this research is to provide the techno-economic and benchmarking analysis of a 100 MWe class molten salt central receiver system using a thermocline hybrid thermal energy storage (TES) system versus conventional two-tank storage. The techno-economic analysis used has been carried out by means of specifically developed transient simulation models to find out a robust comparison between technologies. Thermal energy from storage, annual net electricity production and Levelized Cost of Electricity are the concise and comprehensive figures of merit of this study. An exhaustive effort has been made in order to achieve a well-founded comparison between concentrated solar power plants with equivalent storage system designs in terms of capacity factor and performance. Finally, this research demonstrates that the thermocline hybrid TES system provides a reliable cost effective storage solution that achieves the same Levelized Cost of Electricity as state-of-the-art technology. This is achieved due to the competitive price of the steelmaking slag pebbles versus molten salts, a revalorized processed steel by-product waste from the metallurgical industry used as packed-bed solid filler material for thermocline tanks. The results of this research open an attractive potential for cost reduction in the concentrated solar power sector, a key competitive value for a new market opportunity."
1461,I,"The reversible gas-solid thermochemical reaction between CO2 and SrO to form SrCO3 is considered for storing high-temperature heat delivered by concentrated solar energy systems. To maintain cycling stability, MgO-stabilized SrO-based materials were synthetized with various precursors and support contents by the co-precipitation, sol-gel, wet-mixing and dry-mixing production methods. Samples were analysed by thermogravimetry over multiple consecutive carbonation-calcination cycles in the range of 1000-1100 degrees C. The best performance was obtained by using the wet-mixing method with strontium acetate hemihydrate and porous magnesium oxide as precursors: the formulation with 40 wt% SrO featured stable chemical conversion over 100 consecutive carbonation-calcination cycles at 1000 degrees C and yielded gravimetric energy density of 0.81 MJ/kg."
1462,I,"Estimating and forecasting photovoltaic (PV) power generation in regions-e.g. the area controlled by the transmission system operator (TSO)-is a requirement for the operation of the electricity supply system. An accurate calculation of this quantity requires detailed information of the installed PV systems within the considered region; however, this information is not publicly available making forecasting difficult. Therefore, approximating the undefined PV systems information for use in a PV power model (parameterization) is of critical interest. In this paper, we propose a methodological approach for parameterization using time series of aggregated PV power generation. A Bayesian approach is used to overcome the significant number of unknown parameters in the problem. It regularizes the linear system by imposing constraints on deviations from an initial guess and covariance matrices; the initial guess uses available statistical distributions of PV system metadata. The performance of the proposed forecasting approach is evaluated using estimates of the regional PV power generation from three TSOs and meteorological data from the IFS forecast model (ECMWF). The proposed forecasting approach without the Bayesian parameterization has RMSE of 3.90%, 4.25% and 4.64%, respectively; including the Bayesian approach gives RMSE of 3.82%, 4.23% and 4.51%. For comparison, we also deployed a multiple linear regression which gave RMSE of 3.89%, 4.12% and 4.54%; however, there are considerable downsides to such an approach. Our approach is competitive with TSO forecasting systems despite using far fewer input data and simpler implementation of NWP prediction. This is particularly promising as there are many avenues for future development."
1463,I,"This work focuses on the reliable use of the steel making slag pebble as filler material of thermocline tanks which are combined with conventional molten salt tanks in a hybrid thermal storage configuration. The use of this hybrid configuration not only improves the efficiency and operation of the plant when there is solar radiation fluctuation but also includes pumps in separate molten salt tanks in order to increase the maximum height of the thermocline tanks and its useful storage volume, i.e. its storage capacity. A packed-bed numerical model has been used to study the potential of the slag pebbles in this hybrid storage configuration, comparing it against other well-known potential filler materials for thermocline tanks as the taconite and quartzite rock. The study carried out considers a storage capacity of 9 full load hours for a central receiver system of 110 MWe gross power. The results show that two thermocline tanks of 20 x 20 m, filled with steel making slag pebbles, reaches a capacity of 6.61 full load hours. An economic analysis is included which shows that the hybrid storage solution using slag pebbles represents a cost reduction of 13.7% against the state of the art solution. Additionally, comparing it against other filler materials, the slag hybrid storage solution has a cost reduction of 3.8% and 13% against the quartzite and taconite hybrid storage solution, respectively."
1464,I,"Under non-homogeneous solar irradiation, photovoltaic (PV) panels receive different solar irradiance, resulting in a decrease in efficiency of the PV generation system. There are a few technical options to fix this issue that goes under the name of mismatch. One of these is the reconfiguration of the PV generation system, namely changing the connections of the PV panels from the initial configuration to the optimal one. Such technique has been widely considered for small systems, due to the excessive number of required switches. In this paper, the authors propose a new method for increasing the efficiency of large PV systems under non-homogeneous solar irradiation using Series-Parallel (SP) topology. In the first part of the paper, the authors propose a method containing two key points: a switching matrix to change the connection of PV panels based on SP topology and the proof that the SP-based reconfiguration method can increase the efficiency of the photovoltaic system up to 50%. In the second part, the authors propose the extension of the method proposed in the first part to improve the efficiency of large solar generation systems by means of a two-levels architecture to minimize the cost of fabrication of the switching matrix."
1465,I,"The objective of this work is to experimentally investigate the impact of integrating a Phase Change Material (PCM) on the performance of two different laboratory solar chimney prototypes, rendering it a viable option for yearlong use. It has been stated that solar chimneys can provide constant ventilation and increase air quality in a building. This study aims to provide a different approach in means of improving the current performance of solar chimneys as, nowadays, it is mostly pursued through the modification of the inclination, the air gap size or the inlet/outlet dimensions. The solar chimney prototype mainly analysed in this work is built with 2 cm plywood plates with a thermal conductivity of 0.15 W/mK with a volume of 3.50 x 1.00 x 0.30 m. After a 6 h charge period, a mean ventilation rate above 70 m(3)/h can be achieved with a relative low gain of 550 W/m(2) provided by a series of 7 halogen lamps directed towards an effective collector area of 3.00 m(2). The results obtained in this work show that PCM integration provides a higher ventilation rate and a slower decrease during ventilation only phases (6 h discharge), where the halogen lamps do not provide any energy to the solar chimney. Overall, the implementation of paraffinic PCMs in solar chimneys could be an economically viable option for hybrid design solutions to create a healthy indoor environment within residential buildings through renewable solar energy."
1466,I,"Granular material offer many advantages which qualify them for use as heat transfer medium and heat storage material in solar thermal power plants and industrial processes. Moving bed heat exchangers (MBHE) with horizontal tubes are favorable to extract thermal energy from hot granular materials. However, due to the complex flow phenomena and heat transport mechanisms in granular materials precise design tools for MBHE are lacking. In previous studies we introduced a discrete particle model (DEM) to calculate the granular flow in MBHE and validated it by experiments. In this study we use this precise but computationally expensive DEM model to qualify a more efficient continuum model (CFD) which is being introduced in this work. We compare the two models with regard to the granular flow speed along the tube surface and find deviations of vertical bar Delta u/u(ref)vertical bar < 20% in the upper part of the tubes. Both models coherently predict the formation of a static area at the top of the tubes. The formation of the void area below the tubes is less accurately predicted, calling for further adaptations of the CFD model. The thus qualified CFD allows to study large heat exchanger geometries with substantially reduced computational effort."
1467,I,"The framework on which the physics of silicon solar cells (SiSCs) is based robustly predicts dependences of capacitance on light intensity and voltage, even when most recent innovations are considered as the incorporation of transition metal oxide/Si heterojunctions. However, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) challenge most of the established paradigms, claiming for rethinking of known theories and devising novel models. Here we tackle this scenario by probing and comparing light-induced capacitance responses yielded by these two major exponents in the field of photovoltaic research. SiSCs light capacitances can be easily interpreted in the framework of the so-called chemical capacitance. Latest approaches addressing the intriguing low-frequency capacitive features of PSCs are outlined and compared. Here, apparent similarities and differences between both photovoltaic technologies are highlighted, concerning the observation of light capacitances of chemical origin. It is concluded that, contrary to that occurring in SiSCs, bulk electronic chemical capacitances are not straightforwardly observed in PSCs. As capacitive features exhibited by PSCs are believed to be critically connected to performance degradation and device instability, future research and explanation directions are proposed here for advancing in the understanding of this challenging photovoltaic technology."
1468,I,"This paper presents a generic model for the prediction of the lifetime energy production of photovoltaic (PV) systems and the assessment of their annual energy yield in different time periods of operation. As case studies, it considers domestic PV system generation potentials in the UK and India to demonstrate the model results across a range of contrasting climatic and operating conditions. The model combines long-term averages of solar data, a commercial PV system simulation package and a probability density function to express the range of the annual energy prediction in different time periods of system operation. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis based on degradation rates and energy output uncertainties is embedded in the lifetime energy calculations. The importance of the reliability and maintenance of the PV systems and the energy prediction risks, especially regarding economic viability, are demonstrated through the PV lifetime energy potentials in these two countries. It is shown that, even for countries that are significantly different in respect to their solar resource, PV systems may produce similar amounts of energy during their lifetime for reasonable assumptions of degradation rates and uncertainty levels."
1469,I,"In this study, the photo-assisted SCR-NH3 activities of vanadium containing zeolite X (ZX-V) and Ag@ZX-V catalysts are investigated under visible-light and soft temperature conditions (RT and T = 150 degrees C). The highly dispersed silver was incorporated into the zeolite structure as Ag-n(delta+) nano and sub-nano-clusters with small particle size using a new photochemical concept. The catalysts were characterized using different techniques such as XRD, N-2 sorption, H-TEM, and DR-UV-Vis. An in situ FTIR study of adsorbed CO was also performed for the characterization of the metal sites and their accessibility. The catalytic reaction was investigated using the operando FTIR technique allowing the study of both Ag@ZX-V and ZX-V catalytic surfaces, and the gas phase of the reaction in real time. Both catalysts are not active in dark and only Ag@ZX-V exhibits a photocatalytic activity under visible light. At RT, the results show that silvers clusters promote the photocatalytic oxidation of NH3/NO, and no SCR is observed. This probably due to an energy transfer from the metallic site to the triplet oxygen and the formation of highly oxidant singlet oxygen. However, at T = 150 degrees C a significant photo-assisted SCR activity is observed under visible light irradiation with more than 18% of additional NOx removal. The different behavior of the material at 150 degrees C in respect to its activity at RT is mainly attributed to the additional formation of silver nanoparticles and to the possible formation and conversion of intermediates that are not formed and or converted at RT (thermodynamic limitation). Basing on this study, a possible mechanism of the photo-assisted SCR reaction over Ag@ZX-V catalyst is proposed."
1470,I,"Nowadays, photovoltaic (PV) technology has reached a high level of maturity in terms of module efficiency and cost competitiveness in comparison with other energy technologies. As PV has achieved high levels of deployment, the development of devices that can help to reduce PV operation and maintenance costs has become a priority. Soiling can be cause of significant losses in certain PV plants and its detection has become essential to ensure a correct mitigation. For this reason, accurate and low-cost monitoring devices are needed. While soiling stations have been traditionally employed to measure the impact of soiling, their high cost and maintenance have led to the development of innovative low-cost optical sensors, such as the device presented in this work and named """"DUSST"""" (Detector Unit for Soiling Spectral Transmittance). The thermal characterization of DUSST's components and the methodology used to predict soiling transmittance losses are presented in this study. The results show that the losses can be predicted with an error lower than 1.4%. The method has been verified with an experimental campaign with naturally soiled coupons exposed outdoors in Jae ' n, Spain."
1471,I,"The evaluation of non-visual effects of light is a crucial topic in lighting design research and practice. Performing such analysis requires precise information about the spectral distribution of the tested light source. Assessing non-visual effects of daylight is complicated due to its spectral composition continuously changing, depending on many factors. Currently there are no available databases with spectral and spatial radiation patterns of the sky vault for locations spread all over the world, and an easy and common method to evaluate non-visual effects of daylight is lacking. The goal of the paper is to provide a simple method to evaluate the non-visual potential of daylight, accounting for its variability. In order to present it, spectral measurements were conducted in two European cities in spring and summer. Horizontal and vertical illuminance toward the four cardinal directions was measured. Daylight variability was analysed in terms of illuminance, Correlated Colour Temperature (CCT) and Melanopic to Photopic (M/P) ratio. A comparison between the measured spectra and the CIE standard illuminants was performed and it was found that the usefulness of this method to evaluate non-visual effects of light in terms of M/P is adequate and provides reliable results. Therefore, a simple method to estimate the non-visual potential of daylight based on the use of D series of illuminants was presented and validated by comparing the results with the measured data. Using this method to calculate M/P always achieves RMSPEs below 6%."
1472,I,"In dense urban areas, the use of building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) facades are becoming popular and they are bringing many advantageous along with the energy-saving features. However, at the same time, they raise tensions in capital investments and overall returns. """"Solsmaragden"""" is one of such a commercial building, that is integrated with BIPV facade with the peak power of 127.5 kW and owned by Union eiendomsutvikling AS in Norway. In this paper, a lifecycle cost analysis (LCCA) of BIPV facade integrated to """"Solsmaragden"""" is investigated based on on-field recorded data after four years of operation (2016-2019). While formulating LCCA, numerous benefits from system power generation, societal and environmental benefits, and financial gains due to three different end-of-life material recovery approaches were also considered. The result based on the field monitored performance showed that the net present value (NPV), discounted payback period, internal rate of return and levelised cost of energy of the system is equal to 478,934 NOK, 22 years, 6% and 1.28 NOK/kWh, respectively. It is observed that the BIPV system as a building envelope material for different orientations of the building skin could reimburse not only all the investment costs but also become a source of income for the buildings. The results also illustrated that the granted subsidy is substantially covering the societal and environmental benefits of this project."
1473,I,"Classical quality control (QC) methods of solar irradiance apply easy-to-implement physical or statistical limits that are incapable of detecting low-magnitude measuring errors due to the large width of the intervals. We previously presented the bias-based quality control (BQC), a novel method that flags samples in which the bias of several independent gridded datasets is larger for consecutive days than the historical value. The BQC was previously validated at 313 European and 732 Spanish stations finding multiple low-magnitude errors (e.g., shadows, soiling) not detected by classical QC methods. However, the need for gridded datasets, and ground measurements to characterize the bias, was hindering the BQC implementation. To solve this issue, we present a free web service, www.bqcmethod.com, that implements the BQC algorithm incorporating both the gridded datasets and the reference stations required to use the BQC across Europe from 1983 to 2018. Users only have to upload a CSV file with the global horizontal irradiance measurements to be analyzed. Compared to previous BQC versions, gridded products have been upgraded to SARAH-2, CLARA-A2, ERA5, and the spatial coverage has been extended to all of Europe.

1474,I,"This article describes outdoor temperature-controlled measurement of various photovoltaic (PV) modules fabricated using different technologies and using reference cells with spectral filters. Short-circuit current measurements of all PV modules and reference cells were recorded simultaneously using 16-bits Keysight digitizers and high-resolution Agilent multimeters. The spectral incompatibility factor was calculated considering the spectral response of each device and the spectrum measured outdoors. Corresponding spectra were also generated by the simple model of atmospheric radiative transfer of the sun SMARTS2 and were additionally used to compare the spectral incompatibility factors. The validation of the measurement method was demonstrated by comparing the incompatibility factor calculated with variation of the short-circuit current relationship between the device under test and the reference cell over time. Additionally, it was evaluated how the relationship between spectral variation of irradiance and the spectral response of different technologies affects the productivity in thin-film modules. Main observation from measurements (performed in Labsol) was that a-Si/mu-Si, CdTe, and triple a-Si junction converted 0.21%, 2.47%, and 3.65% more irradiation into electric current (in summer), respectively, compared to c-Si technology. The PV CIGS module converted on average 0.26% more irradiation into electric current in winter compared to c-Si technology. The results help to understand the spectral effects on the working of outdoor PV module and the relationships between measured and modeled spectra, as well as errors introduced by the spectral incompatibility factor."
1475,I,"Wind loads may decrease a heliostat's optical performance by affecting its shape and orientation. As small scale wind tunnel or numerical models cannot reflect a heliostat's dynamic behavior entirely, in this study we investigated a real scale Stellio heliostat installed on the DLR heliostat testing platform where it was exposed to the natural wind. The wind-induced response was captured with a dynamic photogrammetry system that combines a high spatial and high temporal resolution. As its application to a heliostat is novel, the first focus of this paper is to validate the applied setup and the accuracy of measured displacements. The second focus is to discuss the wind-induced Stellio behavior. A method is presented which allows for separating the total wind-induced behavior into a trackingand a slope-relevant part. Based on this separation, the wind induced tracking deviation (0.44 mrad RMS) during the investigated measurement period (mean wind speed approximate to 4.8 m/s, mean turbulence intensity approximate to 26 %) reached a level of approximately one third of a heliostat's typical total tracking deviation. Likewise, during the time step of largest deformations, the wind-induced slope deviation (0.75 mrad RMS) of the most affected facet reached a level of approximately one third of a Stellio facet's total slope deviation. However, wind-induced slope deviations occurred only locally and temporally. Furthermore, wind-excited eigenfrequencies were revealed to have a negligible impact on both the tracking and slope deviation in case of the Stellio. Oscillations and deformations related to frequencies below the eigenfrequencies were rather found to have a predominant impact on the optical performance."
1476,I,"This study reports on the printing of TiO2 nanoparticles and the sensitization of the photoanode by a new digital printing technology, named Digital Materials Deposition """"DMD"""" to fabricate semi-transparent DSSCs. In this study, the push-pull dye coded """"D35"""" and I-3(-)/I- were used respectively as sensitizer and redox mediator. The photovoltaic performances of the solar cells printed with the DMD technology were compared to those prepared by the conventional method consisting of screen-printed nanoparticles and dying process by overnight soaking of the electrode into a solution of the sensitizer. Scanning Electron Microscopy shows that the DMD printed film is more porous than the one deposited by screen printing. The cells prepared by DMD give higher solar energy conversion efficiency (Jsc = 12.65 mA/cm(2), Voc = 775 mV, FF = 75%, PEC = 7.4%) than with conventional screen-printing technique (Jsc = 10.03 mA/cm(2), Voc = 760 mV, FF = 72%, PEC = 5.48%). IMVS/IMPS measurements demonstrate that the superior photocurrent density delivered by DMD printed solar cells is due to a higher charge collection efficiency. Overall, this study demonstrates that DMD technology simplifies the DSSC fabrication process with a reduction of the material consumption and it is quick and efficient representing an innovative and attractive method to manufacture DSSCs."
1477,I,"The photovoltaic (PV) roofs have two main energy-saving effects, which are shading and power supply. Considering the shading and power generation gain jointly, a roof is changed from the building energy end to the building energy supply end, thus changing its energy use system greatly. Therefore, this paper carries out research on the comprehensive energy-saving effect integrating the shading and the power supply gain. Three types of PV rooftops, namely, horizontally-mounted overhead PV rooftop, tilted overhead PV rooftop, and attached PV rooftop are studied to explore their impacts on the heat gain and heat loss of the roof and building's heating and cooling load. In order to estimate the overall energy-saving in different climatic regions in China, an overall energy-saving evaluation method that considers the power generation and shading benefit effects of the PV rooftop is proposed. Based on the climate and solar radiation zones in China, 13 respective cities are selected to be included in the research. The results show that, by considering only the shading effect of PV panels, the tilted PV is more suitable in summer, reducing the heat input, whereas the horizontally-mounted PV is more effective in winter to prevent more heat loss. Regarding the overall energy-saving that considers both the shading and power generation effects of PV panels, building with horizontally-mounted PV rooftop has the highest efficiency in the summer season, while the building with tilted PV rooftop has the highest efficiency in the winter season. The model and analysis of the overall energy-saving presented in this work can provide a guide for the application of rooftop solar PV panels in different climate zones in China."
1478,I,"The algorithm for computing the solar vector of (Blanco et al., 2001) is revisited to improve its accuracy in the period 2020-2050, a period for which the algorithm was not initially designed. The resulting improved algorithm achieves a 25% decrease in the average error of the angular deviation with respect to the true solar vector (from a mean error of 11.81-8.78 arcsec), while simultaneously decreasing the range of variation of the error."
1479,I,"Methods for quick and accurate detection and diagnosis of defects in PV systems are increasingly important as the global photovoltaic (PV) capacity continues to grow at a rapid pace. Two of the most used methods for defect detection involve aerial infrared thermography and data analysis of production data. In this work, we combine the two methods to analyze two utility scale PV plants, providing new understanding about the two methods. We report on the percentage and distribution of thermal anomalies of different categories and quantify their relationship with performance on string level. We find that the most important parameter for determining production losses on string level is the number of module substrings containing thermal anomalies. Due to the large variability of the effect of different thermal signatures, as well as uncertainties in the estimate of the string performance, we find no clear correlation between performance and thermal signature category or temperature. However, a whole hot cell is the thermal signature that on average has the smallest impact on the power output on string level. Finally, in our data, the performance of a string of 20 modules with 3 bypass diodes is on average reduced by 1.16 +/- 0.12% per module substring containing thermal anomalies."
1480,J,"The direct carbolithiation of diphenylacetylenes and their cross-coupling procedure taking advantage of the intermediate alkenyllithium reagents are presented. By employing our recently discovered highly active palladium nanoparticle based catalyst, we were able to couple an alkenyllithium reagent with a high (Z/E) selectivity (10 : 1) and good yield to give the breast cancer drug tamoxifen in just 2 steps from commercially available starting materials and with excellent atom economy and reaction mass efficiency."
1481,J,The first chemical enantioselective synthesis of N-hydroxyaspartic acid derivatives using chiral multifunctional thiourea/boronic acid organocatalysts was developed. A series of fumaric monoacids underwent an intermolecular asymmetric aza-Michael addition of O-alkyl hydroxylamines in excellent regioselectivity. The addition of another carboxylic acid raised the enantiomeric enrichment up to 97% ee. O-Deprotection of the aza-Michael adduct provided an aspartate-derived hydroxylamine fragment applicable for KAHA (alpha-keto acid-hydroxylamine) ligation.
1482,J,"Several N-Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC)-boryl sulfides with B-substituents were prepared. The added steric hindrance leads to much improved selectivities as only the NHC-boryl mono-sulfides were obtained. The B-substituted NHC-boranes are also conducive to more selective S to N NHC-boryl shift, provided that the NHC used is not too sterically demanding."
1483,J,"Chemoselective palladium-catalyzed arylation of polyamines with 6-bromoquinoline has been explored to prepare chelators for the detection of metal cations in aqueous media. The introduction of a single aromatic moiety into non-protected polyamine molecules was achieved using the commercially available Pd(dba) 2/BINAP precatalyst to afford nitrogen chelators, in which the aromatic signalling unit is directly attached to the polyamine residue. Water-soluble receptors were then synthesized using N-alkylation of these polyamines by hydrophilic coordinating residues. By combining rich photophysical properties of the 6-aminoquinoline unit with a high coordination affinity of chelating polyamines and a hydrophilic character of carboxamido-substituted phosphonic acid diesters in a single molecular device, we synthesized chemosensor 5 for selective double-channel (UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopies) detection of CuII ions in aqueous media at physiological levels. This receptor is suitable for the analysis of drinking water and fabrication of paper test strips for the naked-eye detection of CuII ions under UV-light. By increasing the number of donor sites we also obtained chemosensor 6 which is efficient for the detection of HgII ions. Moreover, chemosensor 6 is also suitable for multiple detection of metal ions because it chelates not only HgII but also CuII and ZnII ions displaying different responses of emission in the presence of these three cations."
1484,J,"Mevalonate Kinase (MVK) catalyses the ATP-Mg2+ mediated phosphate transfer of mevalonate to produce mevalonate 5-phosphate and is a key kinase in the mevalonate pathway in the biosynthesis of isopentenyl diphosphate, the precursor of isoprenoid-based biofuels. However, the crystal structure in complex with the native substrate mevalonate, ATP and Mg2+ has not been resolved, which has limited the understanding of its reaction mechanism and therefore its application in the production of isoprenoid-based biofuels. Here using molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and a hybrid QM/MM study, we revisited the location of Mg2+ resolved in the crystal structure of MVK and determined a catalytically competent MVK structure in complex with the native substrate mevalonate and ATP. We demonstrated that significant conformational change on a flexible loop connecting the alpha 6 and alpha 7 helix is induced by the substrate binding. Further, we found that Asp204 is coordinated to the Mg2+ ion. Arg241 plays a crucial role in organizing the triphosphoryl tail of ATP for in-line phosphate transfer and stabilizing the negative charge that accumulates at the beta,gamma-bridging oxygen of ATP upon bond cleavage. Remarkably, we revealed that the phosphorylation of mevalonate catalyzed by MVK occurs via a direct phosphorylation mechanism, instead of the conventionally postulated catalytic base mechanism. The catalytically competent complex structure of MVK as well as the mechanism of reaction will pave the way for the rational engineering of MVK to exploit its applications in the production of biofuels."
1485,J,"A self-templation strategy was used to synthesise isophthalamide [2] catenanes of various sizes in up to 51% yield without the need for metal ions as templates or mediators of covalent bond formation. Using this strategy a bis-monodentate catenane was prepared incorporating exohedral pyridine units. Upon complexation of this ligand with AgOTf a one-dimensional coordination polymer was obtained in the solid state in which both macrocycles of the catenane are involved in binding to the metal nodes, resulting in a rare example of a coordination assembly in which mechanical bonds are incorporated into the structure backbone."
1486,J,The mechanism of the enantioselective Michael addition of diethyl malonate to trans-beta-nitrostyrene catalyzed by a tertiary amine thiourea organocatalyst is explored using experimental C-13 kinetic isotope effects and density functional theory calculations. Large primary C-13 KIEs on the bond-forming carbon atoms of both reactants suggest that carbon-carbon bond formation is the rate-determining step in the catalytic cycle. This work resolves conflicting mechanistic pictures that have emerged from prior experimental and computational studies.
1487,J,"Protein kinases and phosphatases modulate protein structure and function, which in turn regulate cellular activities. The development of novel proteins and protein motifs that are responsive to protein phosphorylation provides new ways to probe the functions of individual protein kinases and the intracellular effects of their activation and downregulation. Herein we develop a minimal motif that is responsive to protein phosphorylation, termed a minimal protein kinase-inducible domain. The encodable protein motif comprises a 7- or 8-residue sequence (DKDADXW or DKDADXXW), derived from EF-Hand calcium-binding domains, that is necessary but not sufficient for binding terbium, combined with a protein phosphorylation site (Ser or Thr at residue 9) that, upon phosphorylation, completes the metal-binding motif. Thus, the motif binds metal poorly and exhibits weak terbium luminescence when not phosphorylated. Upon phosphorylation, the peptide binds metal with significantly higher affinity and exhibits robust terbium luminescence. Phosphorylation results in up to a 23x increase in terbium luminescence. Minimal phosphorylation-dependent motifs as small as 9 residues (DKDADGWIS) were developed. NMR spectroscopy on this lanthanum(III) center dot phosphopeptide complex confirmed that binding occurs in a manner similar to that in an EF-Hand, despite the absence of the conserved Glu12 typically present in an EF-Hand. By combining molecular design with known protein kinase recognition sequences, minimal protein kinase-inducible domains were developed that were responsive to phosphorylation by Protein Kinase A (PKA: DKDADRRW(S/pS)IIAK), Protein Kinase C (PKC: DKDADGWI(T/pT)FRRKA), and Casein Kinase 1 (CK1: DKDADDWA(S/pS)I). Phosphorylation by PKA was quantified in HeLa cell extracts, with a 4.4x increase in fluorescence (terbium luminescence) observed at 544 nm. The optimized minimal motif includes alternating aspartate residues at positions 1, 3, and 5, plus binding through the main-chain carbonyl at position 7; a lysine at position 2 to provide electrostatic balance and reduce binding in the absence of phosphorylation; an alanine at residue 4 to promote the aL conformation observed at that position of the EF Hand; a tryptophan at residue 7 or 8 to sensitize terbium luminescence; and a phosphorylation site with serine or threonine at residue 9. Residues at positions 6; 7 or 8; and 10 or later may be changed to provide kinase specificity. In the CK1-responsive peptide, the acidic residues in the proto-terbium-binding motif are employed as part of the kinase recognition sequence. This work thus presents fundamental rules for the design of compact phosphorylation-responsive terbium-binding motifs, with potential further application to motifs responsive to other protein post-translational modifications."
1488,J,"C-H alkylation reactions using short chain olefins as alkylating agents could be operationally simplified on the lab scale by using quaternary ammonium salts as precursors for these gaseous reagents: Hofmann elimination delivers in situ the desired alkenes with the advantage that the alkene concentration in the liquid phase is high. In case a catalytic system did not tolerate the conditions for Hofmann elimination, a very simple spatial separation of both reactions, Hofmann elimination and direct alkylation, was achieved to circumvent possible side reactions or catalyst deactivation. Additionally, the truly catalytically active species of a rhodium(I) mediated alkylation reaction could be identified by using this approach."
1489,J,"Metabolic engineering of fatty acids and polyketides remains challenging due to unresolved protein-protein interactions that are essential to synthase activity. While several chemical probes have been developed to capture and visualize protein interfaces in these systems, acyl carrier protein (ACP) transacylase (AT) domains remain elusive. Herein, we combine a mutational strategy with fluorescent probe design to expedite the study of AT domains from fatty acid and polyketide synthases. We describe the design and evaluation of inhibitor-inspired and substrate-mimetic reporters containing sulfonyl fluoride and beta-lactone warheads. Moreover, specific active-site labeling occurs by optimizing pH, time, and probe concentration, and selective labeling is achieved in the presence of inhibitors of competing domains. These findings provide a panel of AT-targeting probes and set the stage for future combinatorial biosynthetic and drug discovery initiatives."
1490,J,"An evaluation of a range of aryl, alkyl and vinyl esters as prospective C(1)-ammonium enolate precursors in enantioselective Michael addition-lactonisation processes with (E)-trifluoromethylenones using isothiourea catalysis is reported. Electron deficient aryl esters are required for reactivity, with 2,4,6-trichlorophenyl esters providing optimal product yields. Catalyst screening showed that tetramisole was the most effective isothiourea catalyst, giving the desired dihydropyranone product in excellent yield and stereoselectivity (up to 90 : 10 dr and 98 : 2 er). The scope and limitations of this process have been evaluated, with a range of diester products being generated after ring-opening with MeOH to give stereodefined dihydropyranones with excellent stereocontrol (10 examples, typically similar to 90 : 10 dr and > 95 : 5 er)."
1491,J,"Apoptosis is a highly regulated process involved in the normal organism development and homeostasis. In the context of anticancer therapy, apoptosis is also studied intensively in an attempt to induce cell death in cancer cells. Caspase activation is a known key event in the apoptotic process. In particular, active caspase-3 and -7 are the common effectors in several apoptotic pathways, therefore effector caspase activation may be a promising biomarker for response evaluation to anticancer therapy. Quantitative imaging of apoptosis in vivo could provide early assessment of therapeutic effectiveness and could also be used in drug development to evaluate the efficacy as well as potential toxicity of novel treatments. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a highly sensitive molecular imaging modality that allows non-invasive in vivo imaging of biological processes such as apoptosis by using radiolabeled probes. Here we describe the development and evaluation of fluorine-18-labeled caspase-3 activitybased probes (ABPs) for PET imaging of apoptosis. ABPs were selected by screening of a small library of fluorine-19-labeled DEVD peptides containing different electrophilic warhead groups. An acyloxymethyl ketone was identified with low nanomolar affinity for caspase-3 and was radiolabeled with fluorine-18. The resulting radiotracer, [18F] MICA-302, showed good labeling of active caspase-3 in vitro and favorable pharmacokinetic properties. A mu PET imaging experiment in colorectal tumor xenografts demonstrated an increased tumor accumulation of [18F] MICA-302 in drug-treated versus control animals. Therefore, our data suggest this radiotracer may be useful for clinical PET imaging of response to anticancer therapy."

1494,J,"Fluoroalkylation reactions of (hetero)aromatics have been accomplished through the low-power illumination from red LEDs (lambda(max) = 635 nm) of commercially available perfluoroalkyl iodides R-F-I and phthalocyanine zinc salt as photocatalyst in MeCN : DMF solvent mixture. This methodology has been extended to the perfluorobutylation of sulfides. As far as we are concerned, this is the first report on a perfluoroalkylation reaction of (hetero)aromatics and sulfides under red-light photocatalysis."
1495,J,"An efficient enantioselective synthesis of 3,3-disubstituted phthalides possessing a chiral quaternary carbon center was achieved via catalytic asymmetric bromolactonization that utilized BINOL-derived bifunctional sulfide catalysts. Transformations of the bromo group in optically active phthalide products were also performed to demonstrate the utility of this novel synthetic protocol."
1496,J,"Dyes with nonlinear optical (NLO) properties enable new imaging techniques and photonic systems. We have developed a dye (DANPY-1) for photonics applications in biological substrates such as nucleic acids; however, the design specification also enables it to be used for visualizing biomolecules. It is a prototype dye demonstrating a water-soluble, NLO-active fluorophore with high photostability, a large Stokes shift, and a favorable toxicity profile. A practical and scalable synthetic route to DANPY salts has been optimized featuring: (1) convergent Pd-catalyzed Suzuki coupling with pyridine 4-boronic acid, (2) site-selective pyridyl N-methylation, and (3) direct recovery of crystalline intermediates without chromatography. We characterize the optical properties, biocompatibility, and biological staining behavior of DANPY-1. In addition to stability and solubility across a range of polar media, the DANPY-1 chromophore shows a first hyperpolarizability similar to common NLO dyes such as Disperse Red 1 and DAST, a large two-photon absorption cross section for its size, substantial affinity to nucleic acids in vitro, an ability to stain a variety of cellular components, and strong sensitivity of its fluorescence properties to its dielectric environment."
1497,J,Gold(I) catalysed regio- and stereoselective intermolecular hydroamination of internal alkynes was developed for the effective synthesis of a series of (Z)-functionalised vinylazoles under solvent free conditions. The catalytic hydrogenation of the resulting enamines leads to substituted saturated azoles in good yields.
1498,J,"(-)-Zampanolide is a marine microtubule-stabilizing macrolide that has been shown by in vitro experiments to be a promising anticancer lead compound. Through its unique covalent-binding with beta-tubulin, zampanolide exhibits cytotoxic potency towards multi-drug resistant cancer cells that is superior to paclitaxel. However, the limited availability of zampanolide impedes its further in vivo evaluation as a viable drug candidate. Zampanolide is envisioned to become more drug-like if its chemically fragile side chain can be stabilized; hence, this project aims to develop mimics of zampanolide with a stable side chain using straightforward synthetic methods. To this end, twelve novel zampanolide mimics (51-62) with conjugated and planar side chains have been synthesized via a 24-step sequence for each mimic from commercially available 2-butyn-1-ol as starting material. A Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction incorporates the a, beta-unsaturated ketone side chain and also closes the core macrocycle. WST-1 cell proliferation assays in three docetaxel-sensitive and two docetaxel-resistant human prostate cancer cell models confirm that a suitably designed side chain can serve as a bioisostere for the N-acyl hemiaminal side chain in zampanolide. Mimic 52 with a 17R chiral center was identified as the optimal candidate with IC50 values of 0.29-0.46 mu M against both docetaxel-sensitive (PC-3 and DU145) and docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cell lines (PC-3/DTX and DU145/DTX). Zampanolide mimic 52 exhibited equivalent antiproliferative potency towards both docetaxel-sensitive and docetaxel-resistant cell lines, with relative resistance in the range of 0.9-1.6."
1499,J,"The design, synthesis and structural characterization of non-natural oligomers that adopt well-defined conformations, so called foldamers, is a key objective in developing biomimetic 3D functional architectures. For the aromatic oligoamide foldamer family, use of interactions between side-chains to control conformation is underexplored. The current manuscript addresses this objective through the design, synthesis and conformational analyses of model dimers derived from 3-O-alkylated para-aminobenzoic acid monomers. The O-alkyl groups on these foldamers are capable of adopting syn- or anti-conformers through rotation around the Ar-CO/NH axes. In the syn-conformation this allows the foldamer to act as a topographical mimic of the alpha-helix whereby the O-alkyl groups mimic the spatial orientation of the i and i + 4 side-chains from the alpha-helix. Using molecular modelling and 2D NMR analyses, this work illustrates that covalent links and hydrogen-bonding interactions between side-chains can bias the conformation in favour of the alpha-helix mimicking syn-conformer, offering insight that may be more widely applied to control secondary structure in foldamers."
1500,J,"Two truncated analogues of the polyenyl photoprotective xanthomonadin pigments have been synthesised utilising an iterative Heck-Mizoroki (HM)/iododeboronation cross coupling approach and investigated as models of the natural product photoprotective agents in bacteria. Despite the instability of these types of compounds, both analogues proved to be sufficiently stable to allow isolation, spectroscopic analysis and biological studies of their photoprotective behaviour which showed that despite their shorter polyene chain length, they retained the ability to protect bacteria from photochemical damage; i.e. incorporation of one compound into E. coli provided photoprotective activity against singlet oxygen analogous to the natural photoprotective mechanisms employed by Xanthomonas bacteria, answering key questions about what minimal functionality is required to impart photoprotection, potentially leading to new classes of photoprotective and antioxidants compounds."
1501,J,"An efficient four-step, six-transformation protocol was developed to afford bioactive N-alkyl-or N-arylamide (E)-arylamidines featuring strategic amidine C3 modifications which were inaccessible or low yielding by previous methods. This synthetic approach, exemplified with 24 amidines and requiring only a single purification, highlights a multicomponent Ugi-Mumm rearrangement to afford highly diversified quinazolinones which undergo regiospecific rearrangement to afford new amidines. The method extensively broadens the structural scope of this new class of trisubstituted amidines and demonstrates the tolerance of regional C3 amidine steric bulk, visualized with X-ray crystallographic analysis."
1502,J,"Host-guest complexes exhibiting a 1:1 binding stoichiometry need not consist of a single host and guest. A series of oligopeptides, which were previously reported to have abnormally high binding enthalpies were investigated to deduce whether they exist as a 2:2 quaternary or a 1:1 binary complex with cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]). Through a systematic study of the sequence-specific binding pathways of peptide-CB[8] association, a phenylalanine-leucine dipeptide was found to be capable of switching from a 1:1 stoichiometric complex to a 2:1 complex. By studying the differences in size-based diffusion properties of these two binding modes, the presence of a 1:1 pairwise inclusion complex was verified for the regime where CB[8] is in excess. Findings in this study can be utilised to customise' the precise CB[8]-oligopeptide self-assembly pathway, acting as a useful toolbox in the design of supramolecular systems."
1503,J,"An in-depth study of the reaction of electrochemically generated trifluoromethyl radicals with aryl alkynes in the presence of water is presented. The radicals are readily generated by anodic oxidation of sodium triflinate, an inexpensive and readily available CF3 source, with concomitant reduction of water. Two competitive pathways, i.e. aryl trifluoromethylation vs. oxytrifluoromethylation of the alkyne, which ultimately lead to the generation of -trifluoromethyl ketones, have been observed. The influence of several reaction parameters on the reaction selectivity, including solvent effects, electrode materials and substitution patterns on the aromatic ring of the substrate, has been investigated. A mechanistic rationale for the generation -trifluoromethyl ketones based on cyclic voltammetry data and radical trapping experiments is also presented. DFT calculations carried out at the M06-2X/6-311+G(d,p) level on the two competing pathways account for the observed selectivity."
1504,J,"The hydrophobic moiety of cationic amphiphiles plays an important role in the transfection process because its structure has an impact on both the type of the supramolecular assembly and the dynamic properties of these assemblies. The latter have to exhibit a compromise between stability and instability to efficiently compact then deliver DNA into target cells. In the present work, we report the synthesis of new cationic amphiphiles featuring a thioether function at different positions of two 18-atom length lipid chains and we study their physicochemical properties (anisotropy of fluorescence and compression isotherms) with analogues possessing either oleyl (C18:1) or stearyl (C18:0) chains. We show that the fluidity of cationic lipids featuring a thioether function located close to the middle of each lipid chain is intermediate between that of oleyl- and stearyl-containing analogues. These properties are also supported by the compression isotherm assays. When used as carriers to deliver a plasmid DNA, thioether-containing cationic amphiphiles demonstrate a good ability to transfect human-derived cell lines, with those incorporating such a moiety in the middle of the chain being the most efficient. This work supports the use of a thioether function as a possible alternative to unsaturation in aliphatic lipid chains of cationic amphiphiles to modulate physicochemical behaviours and in turn biological activities such as gene delivery ability."
1505,J,"The insertion of 1,1-difluoroallenes was carried out to form a C-C bond exclusively on their central carbon. o-Bromophenyl-bearing 1,1-difluoroallenes underwent intramolecular insertion in the presence of a palladium catalyst. Regioselective C-C bond formation occurred to form a six-membered carbo-cycle, leading to pharmaceutically and agrochemically promising difluoromethylated naphthalenes."
1506,J,"The fungal metabolite sphaeropsidin A (SphA) has been recognised for its promising cytotoxicity, particularly towards apoptosis- and multidrug-resistant cancers. Owing to its intriguing activity, the development of SphA as a potential anticancer agent has been pursued. However, this endeavour is compromised since SphA exhibits poor physicochemical stability under physiological conditions. Herein, SphA's instability in biological media was explored utilizing LC-MS. Notably, the degradation tendency was found to be markedly enhanced in the presence of amino acids in the cell medium utilized. Furthermore, the study investigated the presence of degradation adducts, including the identification, isolation and structural elucidation of a major degradation metabolite, (4R)-4,4 ',4 '-trimethyl-3 '-oxo-4-vinyl-4 ',5 ',6 ',7 '-tetrahydro-3 ' H-spiro[cyclohexane-1,1 '-isobenzofuran]-2-ene-2-carboxylic acid. Considering the reduced cytotoxic potency of aged SphA solutions, as well as that of the isolated degradation metabolite, the reported antiproliferative activity has been attributed primarily to the parent compound (SphA) and not its degradation species. The fact that SphA continues to exhibit remarkable bioactivity, despite being susceptible to degradation, motivates future research efforts to address the challenges associated with this instability impediment."
1507,J,"We herein report a robust upgraded synthetic protocol for the synthesis ofN-Hnb-Cys crypto-thioester peptides, useful building blocks for segment-based chemical protein synthesis through native chemical ligation. We recently observed the formation of an isomeric co-product when using a different solid support than the originally-reported one, thus hampering the general applicability of the methodology. We undertook a systematic study to characterize this compound and identify the parameters favouring its formation. We show here that epimerization froml- tod-cysteine occurred during the key solid-supported reductive amination step. We also observed the formation of imidazolidinones by-products arising from incomplete reduction of the imine. Structural characterization combined with the deciphering of underlying reaction mechanisms allowed us to optimize conditions that abolished the formation of all these side-products."
1508,J,The rapid synthesis of an amide hydrogen bond templated [1]rotaxane is reported - demonstrating a potential pathway to synthetic analogues of lasso peptides.

1509,J,"Comparative ascaroside profiling ofCaenorhabditisnematodes using HPLC-ESI-(-)-MS/MS precursor ion scanning revealed a class of highly species-specific ascaroside dimers. Their 2- and 4-isomeric, homo- and heterodimeric structures were identified using a combination of HPLC-ESI-(+)-HR-MS/MS spectrometry and high-resolutiondqf-COSY NMR spectroscopy. Structure assignments were confirmed by total synthesis of representative examples. Functional characterization using holding assays indicated that males ofCaenorhabditis remaneiandCaenorhabditis nigoniare exclusively retained by their conspecific ascaroside dimers, demonstrating that dimerization of conserved monomeric building blocks represents a yet undescribed mechanism that generates species-specific signaling molecules in theCaenorhabditisgenus."
1510,J,"Lewis acid-assisted palladium-catalysed dealkoxylation ofN-alkoxyamides has been developed. This reaction proceeded smoothly with a range ofN-alkoxyamides in the absence of an external reductant, thereby establishing a convenient and reductant-free protocol. In addition, a gram-scale reaction could be achieved. Preliminary mechanistic investigations indicated that beta-hydrogen elimination from a palladium alkoxide intermediate generated an intramolecular hydride source."
1511,J,"A concise and asymmetric synthesis of the enantiomeric pyrrolidines2andent-2are herein reported. Both enantiomers were assessed as beta-GCase inhibitors. While compoundent-2acted as a poor competitive inhibitor, its enantiomer2proved to be a potent non-competitive inhibitor. Docking studies were carried out to substantiate their respective protein binding mode. Both pyrrolidines were also able to enhance lysosomal beta-GCase residual activity in N370S homozygous Gaucher fibroblasts. Notably, the non-competitive inhibitor2displayed an enzyme activity enhancement comparable to that of reference compounds IFG and NN-DNJ. This work highlights the impact of inhibitors chirality on their protein binding mode and shows that, beyond competitive inhibitors, the study of non-competitive ones can lead to the identification of new relevant parmacological chaperones."
1512,J,"Paramagnetic macrocycles functionalized with phenylboronic moieties have proven to be interesting for MRI applications based on their ability to recognize cancer cells and generate local contrast. However, full use of the potential of this class of compounds is hampered by laborious and inefficient synthetic and, especially, purification procedures. The amphiphilic character of water-soluble phenylboronates renders them difficult compounds to be prepared through conventional solution synthesis due to the tendency to aggregate and form adducts with other nucleophiles. The new strategy described herein exploits the advantage of solid-phase synthesis with the application of DEAM-PS resin for anchorage and the subsequent simplified derivatization of boronates. GdDOTA-EN-PBA and its fluorinated analogue GdDOTA-EN-F2PBA were synthesized in a much easier, faster and economically convenient way to achieve good yields and purity. Furthermore, the effect of electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms on the aromatic ring of the latter compound was investigated by comparing the physico-chemical properties of both compounds as well as their binding affinity towards melanoma cancer cells."
1513,J,"4-Fluorothreonine (4-FT) is the only naturally occurring fluorinated amino acid antibiotic. Although two conserved proteins in the 4-FT pathway have been found to be involved in self-detoxification mechanisms, the 4-FT-producing strains may also require an alternative pathway to degrade the intracellular 4-FT. In this study, we examined the possible degradation role of three enzymes involved in threonine metabolite pathways toward 4-FT as a possible degradation route to avoidin vivo4-FT accumulation. Among these three enzymes, threonine deaminase was found to catalyse a defluorination reaction to generate 4-hydroxy-alpha-ketobutyrate, which is supposed to be further metabolised by an aldolase that likely is a unique occurrence in the 4-FT-producing strains. Our finding may constitute a 4-FT degradation pathway as a complementary resistance mechanism."
1514,J,"Cyclic octadepsipeptides such as PF1022A and its synthetic derivative emodepside exhibit anthelmintic activity with the latter sold as a commercial drug treatment against gastrointestinal nematodes for animal health use. The structure-permeability relationship of these cyclic depsipeptides that could ultimately provide insights into the compound bioavailability is not yet well understood. The fullyN-methylated amide backbone and apolar sidechain residues do not allow for the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds, normally observed in the membrane-permeable conformations of cyclic peptides. Hence, any understanding gained on these depsipeptides would serve as a prototype for future design strategies. In previous nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies, two macrocyclic core conformers of emodepside were detected, one with all backbone amides intrans-configuration (hereon referred as the symmetric conformer) and the other with one amide incis-configuration (hereon referred as the asymmetric conformer). In addition, these depsipeptides were also reported to be ionophores with a preference of potassium over sodium. In this study, we relate the conformational behavior of PF1022A, emodepside, and closely related analogs with their ionophoric characteristic probed using NMR and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and finally evaluated their passive membrane permeability using PAMPA. We find that the equilibrium between the two core conformers shifts more towards the symmetric conformer upon addition of monovalent cations with selectivity for potassium over sodium. Both the NMR experiments and the theoretical Markov state models based on extensive MD simulations indicate a more rigid backbone for the asymmetric conformation, whereas the symmetric conformation shows greater flexibility. The experimental results further advocate for the symmetric conformation binding the cation. The PAMPA results suggest that the investigated depsipeptides are retained in the membrane, which may be advantageous for the likely target, a membrane-bound potassium channel."
1515,J,"A series of chiral fluorescent helicene-BODIPY conjugates was prepared by the regioselective formylation of aza[4]helicene precursors and then an efficient one-pot two-step BODIPY synthesis (13 examples, 28-82%). Fused conjugates exhibit absorption and fluorescence properties (phi(F)30-45%) in the red visible domain, and a CPL signature could be measured at 605 nm (g(lum)+/- 5 x 10(-4)). Photophysical and electronic properties were investigated and rationalized through first principles."
1516,J,"Developing stereoselective synthetic routes that are efficient and cost-effective allows easy access to biologically active molecules. Our previous syntheses of allele-selective bumped inhibitors of the Bromo and Extra-Terminal (BET) domain proteins, Brd2, Brd3, Brd4 and BrdT, required a wasteful, late-stage alkylation step and expensive chiral separation. To circumvent these limitations, we developed a route based on stereocontrolled alkylation of an N-Pf protected aspartic acid derivative that was used in a divergent, racemisation-free protocol to yield structurally diverse and enantiopure triazolodiazepines. With this approach, we synthesized bumped thienodiazepine-based BET inhibitor, ET-JQ1-OMe, in five steps and 99% ee without the need for chiral chromatography. Exquisite selectivity of ET-JQ1-OMe for Leu-Ala and Leu-Val mutants over wild-type bromodomain was established by isothermal titration calorimetry and X-ray crystallography. Our new approach provides unambiguous chemical evidence for the absolute stereochemistry of the active, allele-specific BET inhibitors and a viable route that will open wider access to this compound class."
1517,J,"The first and facile synthesis of N,N '-dialkylated 2,6,9-triazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonadienes was achieved by the [4 + 4] self-condensation of beta-formyl-beta-nitroenamine in the presence of ammonium acetate. The 2,6- and 2,9-dialkylated products were found to be interconvertible when dissolved in a solvent. This isomerization proceeds through intramolecular ring transformation via a common intermediate under equilibrium."
1518,J,"The first chemical synthesis of lacto-N-neohexaose (LNnH) has been completed using a convergent synthetic strategy. The reaction conditions and donor-acceptor combinations have been carefully refined to minimize side reactions and achieve high yields in all glycosylation steps. Lacto-N-neotetraose, another common human milk oligosaccharide, was also synthesized en route to the target LNnH."
1519,J,"The reaction of diethyl 2,5-bis(tert-butyl)phenoxy-3,6-dihydroxyterephthalate (1) with tetraethylene glycol di(p-toluenesulfonate) under high-dilution conditions afforded several isolated products. Two products were identified as macrocycles with one being the 1 + 1 crown ether derivative 3 (10% yield), and the second being the 2 + 2 crown ether compound D3 (19% yield). The X-ray structure for 3 was determined with the asymmetric unit observed to comprise half of the molecule. The small crown ether ring of 3 interacts with K+ or H+ ions in MeOH, but binding is weak and the macrocyclic cavity is too small to fully encapsulate the K+ ion. Transesterification of compounds 1, its methylated version 2 and 3 with diols such as ethylene glycol or 1,4-butandiol produced monomers (M1-M3) which were reacted with terephthaloyl chloride. Short oligomers were produced (PolyM1-PolyM3) rather than extensive polymeric materials and all displayed solid state fluorescence. The absorption and fluorescence properties of M1-M2 and their polymers can be related to subtle structural changes. The Stokes shift for M2 of 15 627 cm(-1) in DCM is one of the largest observed for a simple organic chromophore in fluid solution."
1520,J,"Iridium-catalysed catalytic, regioselective C-H borylation of beta-aryl-aminopropionic acid derivatives gives access to 3,5-functionalised protected beta-aryl-aminopropionic acid boronates. The synthetic versatility of these new boronates is demonstrated through sequential one-pot functionalisation reactions to give diverse building blocks for medicinal chemistry. The C-H borylation is also effective for dipeptide substrates. We have exemplified this methodology in the synthesis of a pan alpha(v)integrin antagonist."
1521,J,"The Henry reaction was performed using microwave heating within the deep eutectic solvent (DES) choline chloride/urea (ChCl/urea) which acted as both the catalyst and solvent for the reaction. The optimisation of the conditions (temperature, heating mode, time, DES) allowed 1,3-dinitropropane derivatives to be obtained via tandem Henry reaction/Michael addition, in one step from a range of different aromatic aldehydes in high yields and under mild reaction conditions."
1522,J,"Flash vacuum pyrolysis of methyl N-methyl-N-nitrosoanthranilate leads to elimination of nitric oxide and disproportionation of the formed N-radical to 7-(methylamino)phthalide and methyl N-methylanthranilate. This transformation was found to be a convenient, solvent-free method for the preparation of 7-(methylamino)phthalides. An alternative route through pyrolysis of N-benzyl-N-methyl anthranilates was also investigated."
1523,J,"Nucleoside analogues represent an important class of drug candidates. With the aim of searching for novel bioactive nucleosides, we developed an efficient synthetic way to construct a series of aryl 1,2,3-triazole acyclic C-azanucleosides via Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. The aryl 1,2,3-triazole motifs within these azanucleosides showed coplanar features, suggesting they could act as surrogates for large planar aromatic systems or nucleobases. Moreover, several aryltriazole acyclic C-azanucleosides bearing long alkyl chains exhibited potent antiproliferative activity against various cancer cell lines via induction of apoptosis. Most interestingly, the lead compound significantly down-regulated the key proteins involved in the heat shock response pathway, representing the first anticancer acyclic azanucleoside with such a mode of action. These novel aryl 1,2,3-triazole cyclic C-azanucleosides therefore serve as promising paradigms for further exploring anticancer drug candidates."
1524,J,"Invader probes,i.e., DNA duplexes modified with +1 interstrand zippers of intercalator-functionalized nucleotides like 2 '-O-(pyren-1-yl)methyl-RNA monomers, are energetically activated for sequence-unrestricted recognition of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) as they are engineered to violate the neighbor exclusion principle, while displaying high affinity towards complementary DNA sequences. The impact on Invader-mediated dsDNA-recognition upon additional modification with different non-nucleotidic bulges is studied herein, based on the hypothesis that bulge-containing Invader probes will display additionally disrupted base-stacking, more extensive denaturation, and improved dsDNA-recognition efficiency. Indeed, Invader probes featuring a single central large bulge -e.g., a nonyl (C-9) monomer - display improved recognition of model DNA hairpin targetsvis-a-visconventional Invader probes (C(50)values similar to 1.5 mu Mvs.similar to 3.9 mu M). In contrast, probes with two opposing central bulges display less favorable binding characteristics. Remarkably, C-9-modified Invader probes display perfect discrimination between fully complementary dsDNA and dsDNA differing in only one of eighteen base-pairs, underscoring the high binding specificity of double-stranded probes. Cy3-labeled bulge-containing Invader probes are demonstrated to signal the presence of gender-specific DNA sequences in fluorescentin situhybridization assays (FISH) performed under non-denaturing conditions, highlighting one potential application of dsDNA-targeting Invader probes."
1525,J,"Conjugated aldehydes and ketones undergo reaction with Me(2)PhSiBpin (pin: pinacolato) catalyzed by Au nanoparticles supported on TiO2 forming exclusively the beta-borylation products, via the intermediate formation of the labile silaboration adducts. This chemoselectivity pathway is complementary to the so far known analogous reaction catalyzed by other metals, where beta-silylation occurs instead. beta-Borylation also occurs with pinBBpin under identical reaction conditions in a variety of conjugated carbonyl compounds, including esters and amides which are unreactive in their attempted Au-catalyzed silaboration."
1526,J,"The first conceptualised class of dual-binding guanine quadruplex binders has been designed, synthesised and biophysically studied. These compounds combine diaromatic guanidinium systems and neutral tetra-phenylporphyrins (classical binding moiety for guanine quadruplexes) by means of a semi-rigid linker. An extensive screening of a variety of guanine quadruplex structures and double stranded DNAviaUV-vis, FRET and CD experiments revealed the preference of the conjugates towards guanine quadruplexes. Additionally, docking studies indicate the potential dual mode of binding."
1527,J,"The combined Lewis acid catalytic system, generated from molecular iodine and tritylium tetrafluoroborate effectively catalyzed the Friedel-Crafts (FC) arylation of diarylmethyl sulfides providing an efficient access to various unsymmetrical triarylmethanes. The addition of tritylium and iodine created a more active catalytic system to promote the cleavage of sulfidic C-S bonds."
1528,D,"Recent large-scale pandemics such as the covid19, H1N1, Swine flu, Ebola and the Nipah virus, which impacted human health and livelihoods, have come about due to inadequate food systems safeguards to detect, trace and eliminate threats arising from zoonotic diseases. Such diseases are transmitted to humans through their interaction with animals in the food value chain including through the consumption of bush meat. Climate change has also facilitated the emergence of new zoonotic diseases. The lack of adequately enforced food-safety standards in managed agricultural production systems creates the necessary conditions for diseases to mutate into highly contagious strains. The lack of food safety measures in handling, packaging and sales of food increases risks of cross-species contamination. Finally, increasing anti-microbial resistance, combined with rapid urbanization and global interconnectedness allows diseases to spread rapidly among humans. Thus, part of the reconstruction efforts, post covid19, should include prioritizing proactive investments in food safety. The key to stave off another such pandemic lies in integrating one-health knowledge on zoonotic diseases along with food safety measures along the food value chain. Refocusing policy priorities from disease control to prevention will improve international coordination efforts in pandemic prevention. Implementing such proactive actions will cost a very small fraction of the reconstruction budgets. However, the expected benefits of the food-safety approach will include preventing global economic losses due to pandemics."
1529,D,"In this time of the pandemic, nothing is as it used to be. This change creates space for new narratives towards resilience. The resilience perspective implies preparing for shocks as well as various futures that might evolve. Thus, more sustainable food systems cannot only be built to be pandemic proof. This preparation can be facilitated by co-designing contrasting future narratives, identifying means for developing capacity to adapt to those futures and developing tools to enhance that capacity, such as demonstrated here. The capacity of food systems to adapt and transform is enhanced by dialogue, transparency and collective learning in food value chains and networks, sovereignty over resources, and built-in diversity in response to change. In market-led global food chains, supplier-buyer diversity is important, while in public-led regions with some market protection, farm and crop diversity might matter more in response to variability in weather, price and policies. During, for example, an international conflict, or the time of a pandemic, diverse food sourcing from local producer-consumer cooperatives to community-supported and urban agriculture could secure food for citizens. Assessments of critical diversity in response to shocks and volatility can help actors to tailor effective diversity to manage resilience while avoiding the long-feared trade-off between diversity and resource-use efficiency. The interdependence of humanity deserves attention, as food systems are only as resilient as their weakest actor. A truly resilient global food system implies not only preparedness for coming shocks and changes but also a foundation that makes shocks less probable and critical."
1530,D,"COVID-19 undermines food security both directly, by disrupting food systems, and indirectly, through the impacts of lockdowns on household incomes and physical access to food. COVID-19 and responses to the pandemic could undermine food production, processing and marketing, but the most concerning impacts are on the demand-side - economic and physical access to food. This paper identifies three complementary frameworks that can contribute to understanding these effects, which are expected to persist into the post-pandemic phase, after lockdowns are lifted. FAO's 'four pillars'- availability, access, stability and utilisation - and the 'food systems' approach both provide holistic frameworks for analysing food security. Sen's 'entitlement' approach is useful for disaggregating demand-side effects on household production-, labour-, trade- and transfer-based entitlements to food. Drawing on the strengths of each of these frameworks can enhance the understanding of the pandemic's impacts on food security, while also pinpointing areas for governments and other actors to intervene in the food system, to protect the food security of households left vulnerable by COVID-19 and public responses."
1531,D,"In this paper we submit some thoughts on the possible implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for rural people in the countries of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). We base our observations and conclusions on our long-term research experience in the region. The paper focuses on the economics of rural households during this crisis period and its aftermath. We conclude that country differences clearly exist due to their different stages of development. However, while rural households belong to the Corona risk groups, they are also resilient to such a shock. We submit that Governments in the GMS should strengthen policies that conserve the safety-net function of rural villages."
1532,D,"Children who experience poor nutrition during the first 1000 days of life are more vulnerable to illness and death in the near term, as well as to lower work capacity and productivity as adults. These problems motivate research to identify basic and underlying factors that influence risks of child malnutrition. Based on a structured search of existing literature, we identified 90 studies that used statistical analyses to assess relationships between potential factors and major indicators of child malnutrition: stunting, wasting, and underweight. Our review determined that wasting, a measure of acute malnutrition, is substantially understudied compared to the other indicators. We summarize the evidence about relationships between child malnutrition and numerous factors at the individual, household, region/community, and country levels. Our results identify only select relationships that are statistically significant, with consistent signs, across multiple studies. Among the consistent predictors of child malnutrition are shocks due to variations in climate conditions (as measured with indicators of temperature, rainfall, and vegetation) and violent conflict. Limited research has been conducted on the relationship between violent conflict and wasting. Improved understanding of the variables associated with child malnutrition will aid advances in predictive modeling of the risks and severity of malnutrition crises and enhance the effectiveness of responses by the development and humanitarian communities."
1533,D,"Disruption to food systems and impacts on livelihoods and diets have been brought into sharp focus by the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to investigate effects of this multi-layered shock on production, sales, prices, incomes and diets for vegetable farmers in India as both producers and consumers of nutrient-dense foods. We undertook a rapid telephone survey with 448 farmers in 4 states, in one of the first studies to document the early impacts of the pandemic and policy responses on farming households. We find that a majority of farmers report negative impacts on production, sales, prices and incomes. Over 80% of farms reported some decline in sales, and over 20% of farms reported devastating declines (sold almost nothing). Price reductions were reported by over 80% of farmers, and reductions by more than half for 50% of farmers. Similarly, farm income reportedly dropped for 90% of farms, and by more than half for 60%. Of surveyed households, 62% reported disruptions to their diets. A majority of farm households reported reduced ability to access the most nutrient-dense foods. Around 80% of households reported ability to protect their staple food consumption, and the largest falls in consumption were in fruit and animal source foods other than dairy, in around half of households. Reported vegetable consumption fell in almost 30% of households, but vegetables were also the only food group where consumption increased for some, in around 15% of households. Our data suggest higher vulnerability of female farmers in terms of both livelihoods and diet, and differential effects on smaller and larger farms, meaning different farms may require different types of support in order to continue to function. Farms reported diverse coping strategies to maintain sales, though often with negative implications for reported incomes. The ability to consume one's own produce may be somewhat protective of diets when other routes to food access fail. The impacts of COVID-19 and subsequent policy responses on both livelihoods and diets in horticultural households risk rolling back the impressive economic and nutrition gains India has seen over the past decade. Food systems, and particularly those making available the most nutrient-dense foods, must be considered in ongoing and future government responses."
1534,D,"The COVID-19 crisis is worsening food insecurity by undermining informal food chains. We focus on impacts involving the informal food chains that incorporate the resilience-enhancing biodiversity of food and agriculture known as agrobiodiversity. Our analysis addresses how informal food chains and agrobiodiversity are impacted by policies and interventions amidst COVID-19 disruptions. Our methodology relies on research in Peru with a focus on the cites and surrounding areas of Lima, Arequipa, Cusco, Huancayo, and Huanuco. We extend these insights to similar challenges and opportunities across western South America and other word regions. We utilize the four-part Agrobiodiversity Knowledge Framework to guide our examination of agrobiodiversity-related processes that interconnect governance, nutrition, agroecology, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results detail three links of informal food chains that are being disrupted and yet can offer resilience. These are food retailing, logistics and transportation, and seed systems. Utilization of the Agrobiodiversity Knowledge Framework cuts through highly complex issues to elaborate key food-security difficulties facing informal systems and how they can be strengthened to provide more resilience. We identify the specific roles of agrobiodiversity in resilience-enhancing processes that need strategic policy and program support. Results identify ways to augment the resilience of informal food chains using agrobiodiversity and the empowerment of social groups and organizations in urban food systems and rural communities. We conclude that the disruptions triggered by the global COVID-19 pandemic highlight the need to use agrobiodiversity as an instrument for resilience in informal food chains."
1535,D,"In the context of developing countries, early evidence suggests that the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on food production systems is complex, heterogenous, and dynamic. As such, robust monitoring of the impact of the health crisis and containment measures across agricultural value chains will likely prove vitally important. With Bangladesh as a case study, we discuss the building blocks of a comprehensive monitoring system for prioritizing and designing interventions that respond to food system disruptions from COVID-19 and preemptively avoid further cascading negative effects. We also highlight the need for parallel research that identifies pathways for enhancing information flow, analysis, and action to improve the efficiency and reliability of input and output value chains. In aggregate, this preliminary work highlights the building blocks of resilient food systems to external shocks such as COVID-19 pandemic in the context of developing nations. In doing so, we call attention to the importance of 'infection safe' agricultural input and output distribution logistics, extended social safety nets, adequate credit facilities, and innovative labor management tools alongside, appropriate farm mechanization. In addition, digital extension services, circular nutrient flows, enhanced storage facilities, as well as innovative and robust marketing mechanisms are required. These should be considered in parallel with effective international trade management policies and institutions as crucial supportive measures."
1536,D,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated mitigation measures are highlighting resiliency and vulnerability of food systems with consequences for diets, food security, and health outcomes. Frameworks and tools are called for to evaluate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as identify entry points for implementing preparedness efforts. We support it is critical to adopt a food environment typology framework based on the different types of food environments that people have access to in order to examine how their relationship with food environments shift with disruptions such as COVID-19 and, ultimately impact diets and food security. Here, we provide an overview of applying a food environment typology framework for developing and implementing a rapid tool to evaluate the effects of COVID-19 on interactions people have with their food environments. This tool was developed on the basis of a preliminary case study with smallholder farmers in China that generated a set of key hypotheses. We modified the tool in order to be applicable to diverse contexts in low-, middle-, and high-income countries. Other researchers can implement the rapid tool presented here during times of COVID-19 as well as other disruptions towards identifying barriers and opportunities for enhancing food system resilience."
1537,D,"The UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Target 2.5 explicitly calls for the maintenance of genetic diversity of seeds through soundly managed and diversified seed and plant banks at national, regional, and international levels as an essential undertaking to end global hunger (SDG Goal 2). This special issue results from a renewed call to demonstrate the value-in-use of conserving and supplying plant genetic resources conserved in genebanks to researchers, plant breeders, and farmers. We present these studies as a collective contribution to a relatively small body of literature that highlights not only the importance of crop plant diversity managed by genebanks but also the diversity of genebank functions and uses. In this overview, we begin by restating foundation concepts that economists have applied to study the value of crop genetic resources conserved as genebank accessions. We then provide a synthesis of previous research on genebank values from the late 1990s until the present. We summarize the main messages of the studies included in this special issue of Food Security and explain how they contribute to a better understanding of the role, function, and value of genebanks, particularly as we address food security challenges in a changing agricultural context. Finally, we draw implications for further applied research and policy."
1538,D,"In addressing COVID-19, African governments should not forget the livelihoods as well as the food and nutrition security of their citizens. With over 70% of the workforce in the informal sector without any social protection and health insurance, the pandemic could have a devastating impact on income and livelihoods as well as food and nutrition security for workers up and down the food chain. There are ten steps African governments can take to ensure that their response to the disease takes food and nutrition security into account: 1. Protect food supply chains and consider them essential services; 2. Consider fiscal and monetary incentives; 3. Prioritize healthy diets; 4. Use food reserves wisely; 5. Keep food markets open while ensuring safety; 6. Use mobile cash transfers for social protection; 7. Protect farmers and food workers; 8. Prioritize gender equality; 9. Instill a sense of solidarity; and 10. Avoid export bans."
1539,D,"The urban population in Sub-Saharan Africa is projected to expand by nearly 800 million people in the next 30 years. How this rapid urban transition is affecting household-level urban food security, and reverberating into broader food systems, is poorly understood. To fill this gap, we use data from a 2017 survey (n = 668) of low- and middle-income residents of Accra, Ghana, to characterize and compare the predictors of household-level food security using three established metrics: the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS); the Household Food Insecurity Access Prevalence (HFIAP); and the Food Consumption Score (FCS). According to HFIAP, 70% of sampled households are food insecure, but only 2% fall below acceptable thresholds measured by FCS. Only one household reported sourcing food from modern supermarkets and fewer than 3% produce food for consumption through gardening, farming, or fishing. Instead, households rely on purchased food from traditional markets, local stalls and kiosks, and street hawkers. Results from a suite of general linear models show that household assets, education, and demographic characteristics are significantly associated with food security outcomes according to HFIAS and HFIAP. The poor correlation and weak model agreement between dietary recall such as FCS, and experience-based food security metrics, like HFIAS and HFIAP, highlight limitations of employing historically rural-centric food security measurement approaches within the urban context. Given that Sub-Saharan Africa's future is urban, our results add empirical evidence in support of the growing chorus of scholars advocating for comprehensive urban-oriented food security research and policy agendas across Sub-Saharan Africa."
1540,D,"Fish is an excellent source of protein, but can also be a good source of micronutrients. In Zambia fish is the main animal food source for poor women and children, two groups which are likely to suffer from inadequate micronutrient supply (hidden hunger). Although the potential of fish to combat hidden hunger is increasingly recognized and fisheries and aquaculture have been identified as key resources in addressing food and nutrition security issues in Zambia, only limited information on the nutrient composition of consumed fish species and products is available. Thus the objectives of this paper are to give a quantitative description of the nutritional composition of fish and fish products consumed in Zambia, and to estimate their potential to the Recommended Daily Intakes (RDIs) of micronutrients. Therefore approximately forty fish species in various kinds of processing were collected and prepared following local customs. Samples were analysed for macronutrients such as protein and fat. Contents of B-vitamins and minerals were also analysed. Protein content was overall similar, while fat content and fatty acid composition varied considerably. Most fish contained high amounts of niacin and cobalamin, but small fish usually contained the most cobalamin. Small fish contained up to 32 times the amount of calcium than other fish and often contained more iron and zinc, too. Overall small fish species, which are commonly consumed by poor women and children, can be used to combat hidden hunger in Zambia, due to high levels of cobalamin, calcium, iron and zinc."
1541,D,"This opinion piece looks at the substantial role of informal traders in ensuring food security, and other economic and social goods in South Africa and how they have been impacted by Covid-19 and responses to it. The state responses have reflected a continued undervaluing and undermining of this sector to the detriment of the traders themselves, their suppliers, and their customers. There is a need for a new valuing of the sector that would recognise and build on its mode of ordering and key contributions to society. This needs to include: shifting the narrative about the actors involved and challenging the concept of """"informal""""; planning and regulating to ensure more space for owner-operated small-scale food retailers; and putting in place a social-safety net to support them in times of crisis."
1542,D,"This study examines the impact of COVID-19 related 'stay-at-home' restrictions on food prices in 31 European countries. I combine the European Union's Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) with the Stay-at-Home Restriction Index (SHRI) from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) dataset for January-May 2020. The results of a series of difference-in-difference regression models reveal that the severity of stay-at-home restrictions increased overall food prices by 1% in March 2020, compared to January and February 2020. The price level for food continued to rise in the high stay-at-home restriction countries relative to thier counterpart in April but stabilised in May. The food categories that witnessed the most significant surges in prices were meat, fish & seafood, and vegetables. The prices of bread & cereals, fruits, milk, cheese & eggs and oils & fats were not significantly affected. The correlations between food prices and stay-at-home restrictions were significant after controlling for cross-country variations in COVID-19 affectedness and other mitigation and adaptation measures, such as international travel controls, road closures and the size of the economic stimulus packages. This study presents the first empirical evidence of food price inflation as an unintended consequence of COVID-19 pandemic containment measures in one of the most severely hit continents of the world."
1543,D,"The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on food and nutrition insecurity are likely to be significant for Small Island Developing States due to their high dependence on foreign tourism, reliance on imported foods and underdeveloped local food production systems. SIDS are already experiencing high rates of nutrition-related death and disability, including double and triple burdens of malnutrition due to unhealthy diets. We consider the potential role for improved local food production to offset the severity of food system shocks in SIDS and identify the need for localized approaches to embrace systems thinking in order to facilitate communication, coordination and build resilience."
1544,D,"Past approaches to food security in the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) were informed by concerns about food availability. They aimed at domestic self-sufficiency and self-sufficiency by proxy (via farmland investments abroad). These strategies have failed. Water scarcity at home increasingly compromises agricultural production. Farmland investments abroad have not matched ambitious related announcements due to a complex mixture of commercial, socio-economic and political factors. They do not contribute meaningful quantities to the Gulf countries' food imports. The failure of such strategies has prompted a shift of focus instead towards value chain management as a means to secure food availability. Rather than trying to fight food import dependence, the Gulf countries now accept and manage it. However, malnutrition that leads to high levels of obesity and diabetes constitutes a risk factor in the face of COVID-19. Food accessibility for vulnerable population segments such as migrant labour is another issue that requires yet further policy measures, such as safety nets - whose expansion would be politically controversial if not impossible, however."
1545,D,"This brief article aims to interrogate some widely used concepts in framing the interactions between disease epidemics, food systems and nutrition, with a particular focus on the COVID-19 crisis. How should we conceptualize vulnerability in such situations - both with regard to viral exposure and to subsequent nutrition-relevant impacts of epidemics and responses (including lockdowns)? Is it possible to simultaneously pursue strategies aimed at strengthening resilience and driving transformation ('building back better')? What type of framing and conceptualization can help illuminate entry points and options for responding effectively to interacting crises? In addressing these questions, it's important to re-visit lessons from past attempts to address the impacts of epidemics on food and nutrition security."
1546,D,"A vast majority of the relief and rehabilitation packages announced in the months following the nationwide lockdown in India have focused on economic rehabilitation. However, the education sector has remained absent from this effort, including in India's central government's 250 billion dollar stimulus package. In this paper, we discuss the implications of lockdown-induced school and rural child-care center closures on education and health outcomes for the urban and rural poor. We especially focus on food and nutritional security of children who depend on school feeding and supplementary nutrition programs. We argue that the impacts are likely to be much more severe for girls as well as for children from already disadvantaged ethnic and caste groups. We also discuss ways in which existing social security programs can be leveraged and strengthened to ameliorate these impacts."
1547,I,"The main control objective in commercial solar parabolic plants is to track the average temperature of all the loops around a reference set by the operator, by manipulating the flow of a synthetic oil. Due to the large number of loops existing in current solar plants and the vast extension that they cover, obtaining a precise knowledge of every loops efficiency becomes a very challenging task. Parameters such as loops reflectivity, tube absorptance, optical efficiency may exhibit a great disparity due to dirt accumulated and atmospheric conditions. Because of this, the most efficient loops achieve higher temperatures and the collectors may have to be set out of focus in many cases. This paper presents a case study on a simulation model of a large scale parabolic plant, 50 MW, in which a control of the aperture of the solar field loops inlet valves is applied through a nonlinear optimization problem. The goal is to reduce the imbalance of loops temperature caused by the difference in efficiencies. The idea is opening the input valves of the most efficient loops to increase the incoming flow-rate and reducing the flow in the less efficient loops. This will prevent, in many cases, the activation of the defocus control avoiding energy losses and minimizing the deterioration of actuators. The optimization problem will need estimations of the loops states and parameters. An Unscented Kalman Filter is used to estimate the loops temperatures states and a concentrated parameter model is used to estimate the loops efficiencies. A loop clustering is implemented to avoid high computation times. Simulation results showing thermal balance of the field minimizing the defocusing actions are presented."
1548,I,"Prudent and efficient utilization of renewable energy sources is needed in order to achieve clean energy transition. Since energy use in buildings represents around 40% of total energy use in European Union the reduction of energy use in this sector is most definitely needed. One of the great challenges in this sector represents retrofit of residential buildings where 3/4 of buildings in Europe are residential. To reduce energy consumption and increase the use of renewables in existing residential buildings to achieve nearly zero energy buildings (nZEB) a holistic approach of retrofit with interconnected technological system is needed. In the first part of this paper the nZEB and thermal energy storage are introduced for further implementation of the phase change material (PCM) into storage tank. Furthermore energy toolkit based on the synergetic interaction between technologies integrated in the system for holistic retrofit of residential buildings, which is under development within HEART project (HORIZON 2020), is presented. In this project step towards self-sufficient heating and cooling of building is made with increase in on-site consumption of self-produced energy from solar energy and interconnection between PV, electrical storage, heat pump, thermal energy storage, fan coil heat pump, cloud based decision support and building energy management system. With such a smart energy system the almost zero-energy buildings will be possible to decrease energy use in residential sector. Improvement of sensible thermal energy storage with implemented cylindrical modules filled with PCM is investigated experimentally. The results from experiment show that thermal energy storage unit with integrated modules filled with PCM can supply desired level of water temperature for longer period of time. The advantage of PCM in thermal energy storage is in applications that needs narrow temperature range of supplying and storing thermal energy what is the subject matter of consideration in the case of HEART project."
1549,I,"Optimising the aiming strategy is crucial for Solar Power Tower plants, in order to maximise the energy generated, whilst also preventing catastrophic damage to receiver components. In this work, a bi-objective optimisation model is developed to find optimal aiming strategies for a Solar Power Tower plant. The primary objective to maximise the radiation captured by the receiver is offset by a secondary objective to minimise the deviation from a desired target distribution, which is designed by solar plant operators to improve plant efficiency. A numerical method is proposed to solve the optimisation problem, and an illustrative example is presented to show functionality of the model and the numerical method. Conclusions are drawn on the model presented, extensions are considered and current work is discussed."
1550,I,"Building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV)-vacuum system is promising for advanced window application due to its ability to reduce heat transfer, control over admitted solar heat and generates environmentally benign electricity. In this work, numerically thermal comfort for an unfurnished room comprising of BIPV-vacuum glazing was evaluated for the United Kingdom (UK) climate. Required parameters to determine thermal comfort, one-dimensional heat transfer model was developed and validated for BIPV-vacuum glazing and results were compared with BIPV-double-pane glazing system. PV cell temperature difference between these two different types of glazing was 24 degrees C. For the UK climate, BIPV-vacuum glazing offered 26% higher room temperature at clear sunny day compared to BIPV-double system. BIPV-vacuum glazing system provided soothing or comfortable thermal comfort during mid-day period for a clear sunny day at temperate climate. In a combined BIPV-vacuum glazing, it was also predicted that vacuum glass facing external ambient is suitable for the UK climate whilst vacuum glass facing internal room ambient is applicable for Indian climate."
1551,I,This paper addresses experimental results on fluidized particle-in-tube solar receiver using a finned tube in order to increase wall-to-particle heat transfer. On-sun tests of a single finned tube solar receiver were performed at the focus of the 1 MW solar furnace of Odeillo. Several solar flux densities and distributions (mean values 236-485 kW/m(2)) and particle mass flux densities (G = 20-110 kg/m(2).s) were tested. A detailed analysis of tube wall and particle temperature distributions and temperature measurement accuracy is proposed. The power extracted by the particle suspension ranges between 17.8 kW and 32 kW and the typical thermal efficiency of this lab-scale solar receiver is about 75%. The mean global wall-to-fluidized particle heat transfer coefficient is calculated as 1200 +/- 400 W/m(2).K for Gin the range 30-110 kg/m(2).s. The main uncertainty on the heat transfer coefficient is due to uncertainty on wall temperature measurement during on-sun experiments. The range of this uncertainty is estimated by comparing infra-red camera measurements and wall-welded thermocouple data.
1552,I,"The increased usage of solar energy places additional importance on forecasts of solar radiation. Solar panel power production is primarily driven by the amount of solar radiation and it is therefore important to have accurate forecasts of solar radiation. Accurate forecasts that also give information on the forecast uncertainties can help users of solar energy to make better solar radiation based decisions related to the stability of the electrical grid. To achieve this, we apply statistical post-processing techniques that determine relationships between observations of global radiation (made within the KNMI network of automatic weather stations in the Netherlands) and forecasts of various meteorological variables from the numerical weather prediction (NWP) model HARMONIE-AROME (HA) and the atmospheric composition model CAMS. Those relationships are used to produce probabilistic forecasts of global radiation. We compare 7 different statistical post-processing methods, consisting of two parametric and five non-parametric methods. We find that all methods are able to generate probabilistic forecasts that improve the raw global radiation forecast from HA according to the root mean squared error (on the median) and the potential economic value. Additionally, we show how important the predictors are in the different regression methods. We also compare the regression methods using various probabilistic scoring metrics, namely the continuous ranked probability skill score, the Brier skill score and reliability diagrams. We find that quantile regression and generalized random forests generally perform best. In (near) clear sky conditions the non-parametric methods have more skill than the parametric ones."
1553,I,"In this work, a systematic study of different tuning rules of proportional-integral (PI) control parameters applied to Photovoltaic Irrigation Systems (PVIS) based on Standard Frequency Converters (SFCs) has been carried out. A laboratory system has been implemented to obtain the PI control parameters by means of the most widely accepted tuning rules in control systems. Based on the step-input response modeling, we have been applied the tuning rules of Ziegler-Nichols (ZNs), Chien-Hrones-Reswick (CHR), Cohen-Coon (C-C), Lambda and AMIGOs. Based on frequency response modeling we have been applied the tuning rules of Ziegler-Nichols (ZNf) and AMIGOf. The PI controller parameters obtained from these tuning rules have been evaluated by performing two types of tests: start-up and sudden drop of the available PV power. The experimental results show that the parameter sets obtained by the ZNs, CHR and AMIGOf rules are the only ones that pass all the start-up tests and that the tests of sudden drop of the available PV power are only passed by the configuration obtained by the AMIGOf rules. Therefore, it has experimentally verified that the AMIGO tuning rules based on the frequency response modeling are the only ones that provide adequate values for the PI control parameters for PV irrigation systems."
1554,I,"Soiling of solar reflectors affects their reflectance and has a direct impact on the power output of concentrated solar power (CSP) plants. One way to minimize the efficiency losses is the implementation of anti-soiling coatings on the reflector surfaces. This method is being studied for the past decade, but has not been successfully commercialized yet. The purpose of the coatings is to reduce soiling and improve the washability of the reflectors. In this work results are presented from an extensive outdoor campaign of two potential anti-soiling coatings under realistic conditions at a representative CSP site in southern Spain. Nearly six years of outdoor data are available, which makes this campaign the longest published on this type of coatings. Regular cleaning and reflectance measurements were performed during the exposure and conclusions about the performance and durability of the coatings are drawn. It is shown that in the initial state the coatings show an advantageous behavior, resulting in higher reflectance during outdoor exposure due to less soiling and better cleaning of the reflectors. The second main finding is that durability is an important issue for the implemented coatings, as their properties degrade over time resulting in lower reflectance values after several years of exposure compared to conventional glass reflectors."
1555,I,"The optimal design of distributed generation systems is of foremost importance to reduce fossil fuel consumption and mitigate the environmental impact of human activities in urban areas. Moreover, an efficient and integrated control strategy is needed for each of the components of a distributed generation plant, in order to reach the expected economic and environmental performances. In this paper, the transition from natural gas to electricity-based heating is evaluated for residential applications, considering the interplay between photovoltaic electricity produced on site and the thermal energy storage, to grant the optimal management of heating devices. The energy demand of an apartment building, under different climatic conditions, is taken as a reference and four power plant solutions are assessed in terms of energy cost and pollution reduction potential, compared to a baseline plant configuration. The performance of each power plant is analyzed assuming an optimized control strategy, which is determined through a graph-based methodology that was previously developed and validated by the authors. Outcomes from our study show that, if heat pumps are used instead of natural gas boilers, energy costs are reduced up to 41%, while CO2 emissions are reduced up to 73%, depending on the climatic conditions. Our results provide a sound basis for considering the larger penetration of photovoltaic plants as an effective solution towards cleaner and more efficient heating technologies for civil applications. The simultaneous utilization of heat pumps (as substitutes of boilers) and photovoltaic panels yields a positive synergy that nullifies the local pollution, drastically cuts the CO2 emission, and guarantees the economical sustainability of the investment in renewable energy sources without subsidiary mechanisms."
1556,I,"A solar assisted ground source heat pump (SAGSHP) system is a promising technology which pairs two widely abundant renewable energy sources, solar and shallow geothermal. In space heating dominated regions, the addition of solar collectors to conventional ground source systems improves their feasibility. There are many aspects which influence the system's efficiency; but experimentation to optimize these would requires high capital investment and take a very long time. Therefore, mathematical modeling and computer-based simulations are preferable methods to conduct sensitivity and feasibility analyses. In this work, a PVT based solar assisted ground source heat pump system was modeled using TRNSYS program, and sensitivity analyses were conducted. For the PVT collectors, an experimentally verified transient model was utilized, while experimental data were used to validate a novel very shallow borefield. For the heat pump model, manufacturer's performance data along with a new novel method were combined, and a new component was created in the simulation platform. A single family dwelling with domestic hot water demand was assumed for the heating load, and weather data from Birmingham, West Midlands, UK was used. The simulation results were evaluated by utilizing the annual specific productivity metric rather than the systems seasonal performance factor, which is the current choice for SAGSHP systems. The proposed evaluation approach was found be capable of clarifying, in detail, the effect of the parametric variation on the system's energy performance. The sensitivity analyses are focused on six parameters on the energy conversion side, with the heat pump's evaporator as the physical boundary. It was found that the storage capacity and the plate heat exchanger's effectiveness, contribute the most to the system's and PVTs' heat productivity. Whilst heat productivity depended more on the parameters' variation, the power generation was influenced mainly by the collectors' tilt. The results of this study are significant for design and operation of these systems."
1557,I,"Photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) collectors are hybrid solutions for the conversion of solar energy into electrical and thermal energy. The development of validated and standardized PVT collector models is important for the comparison of products, informed decision making based on energetic and economic performance, and to promote the market diffusion of PVT technology. This contribution presents a novel PVT performance model, compares different parameter identification approaches, and validates the model and its implementation in a common simulation software (TRNSYS) for system simulations. For the thermal performance model, a two-node model with either one or two thermal capacities is compared. The two-node approach with one thermal capacity represents an extension of the quasi-dynamic solar thermal collector model with the added functionality of the electrical performance. This modeling approach has also proven to be the recommended modeling approach for the investigated PVT collectors in this work. Furthermore, the parameter identification procedure is described in detail and different approaches are compared. It is shown that a combined identification of thermal and electrical model parameters with determination of all thermal and electrical model parameters is the most suitable approach regarding accuracy and processing effort. To sum up, the presented PVT performance model and the proposed parameter identification procedure achieve a good agreement of simulated and measured thermal and electrical power output for the analyzed PVT collector types and operating conditions. Hence, the model is suitable for dynamic simulation studies and is proposed as standardized performance model for PVT collectors."
1558,I,"This paper focuses on the part of Tubular Daylight Guide Systems (TDGS): the Mirrored Light-Pipe (MLP). MLP is part of the multiple specular reflection conveyors. They allow daylight to be transported and distributed in dark rooms far from traditional openings while limiting heat transmission. It involves collecting, concentrating, and diffusing sunlight using a dome placed on the roof. It is then conveyed through a highly reflective tube and diffused into a building's room using a diffuser. Previous work (Malet-Damour et al., 2017, 2016) has shown that it was necessary to identify and study the climate in which the light pipe will be installed. A state-of-the-art of experimental and numerical results was conducted over the period from1990 to 2019. It revealed that the behavior of the light pipe depends strongly on the indoor (area to be illuminated) and outdoor (meteorology) environment. This paper presents the experimental observations of studies conducted from 2013 to 2015 on Mirrored Light-Pipe in Reunion Island. The climate in which the experiment was undertaken is presented with a focus on illuminance. In 2019, this study is the only one analyzing the performance of the light pipe in extreme situations of extreme sunlight conditions (maximum global illuminance of around 200 Klux). Experimental results based on various scenarios quantified the impact of the reflection coefficient of the area to be illuminated, the presence of an anticyclonic dome, the type of sky or the ideal position of a sub-dome deflector. The results are very encouraging."
1559,I,"With declining costs and increasing performance, the deployment of renewable energy systems is growing faster. In 2017, for the first time, the number of people without access to electricity dropped down below 1 billion, but trends on energy access likewise fall short of global goals. Particular attention is given to stand-alone solar photovoltaic systems in rural areas or where grid extension is unfeasible. Tools to evaluate electrification projects are available, but they are based on simulations that do not cover all aspects of the design-space. Automated verification using model checking has proven to be an effective technique to validate complex (state transition) systems. This paper marks the first application of software model checking to formally verify the design of a stand-alone solar photovoltaic system, including solar panel, charge controller, battery, inverter, and electric load. Our main focus is on the project validation to be carried out just after the system sizing, i.e., prior to buying equipment and deployment, as a safe approach to ensure the intended behavior. Five case studies were used to evaluate this proposed approach and to compare that with specialized simulation tool. Different verification tools were evaluated to compare performance and soundness among automated verifiers. The results reported by our automated verification method and by the simulation tool were compared with data collected from dwellers of the deployed cases, thereby showing the effectiveness of our approach, where specific conditions that lead to failures in a solar photovoltaic system are only detailed by the automated verification method."
1560,I,"Simulated current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of photovoltaic (PV) cells and modules are significant for the performance assessment, design and quality control, which are decided by the accurate determination of the intrinsic parameters of the devices. Commonly, a single-diode model is utilized to extract these parameters such as the ideality factor (n), series resistance (R-s), shunt resistance (R-sh), saturation current (I-o) and photo-generated current (I-lambda). Driven by this idea, a new mathematical manipulation was performed on the single-diode equation that yielded a non-linear formula of R-s. Later, Brents algorithm was used to precisely estimate R-s at every fine-tuned point of n, thereby all other parameters were determined. The set of parameters that provided the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) between the experimental and simulated I-V data were chosen to be optimum. The proposed Brents algorithm (BA) was shown outperform several recently reported computational and heuristic algorithms that were exploited to mine the single-diode model parameters for solar cells and modules with varied device temperatures and solar irradiation conditions."
1561,I,"We report on the potential of tuning poly(9-vinylcarbazole) (PVK) properties through functionalization for an application as hole transport material (HTM) for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The synthesized PVK-based polymers were substituted with moieties of interest to improve the solubility, the charge transport properties, or to tune energy levels. Bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amine moieties were found to improve the hole mobility and to increase the HOMO level of the PVK. Therefore, PSCs employing PVK-[N(PhOCH3)(2)](2) as HTM exhibited a best PCE of 16.7%. Compared to spiro-OMeTAD, first studies have shown that PVK-[N(PhOCH3)(2)](2) could extend PSC lifetime."
1562,I,"Photovoltaic (PV) systems power losses are approximately 15-20% of the performance ratio for current PV systems. There are several reasons that explain PV modules failures, and since they are connected in series to the rest of the string, a failure in one module may result in losses in the entire string. In addition, some of these failures, if are not fixed in time may become permanent and may reduce the lifespan of the PV modules. Periodic monitoring is the only way to detect these failures. Monitoring techniques oriented to groups of modules are unable to detect faults in individual modules. I-V curve tracers, which are oriented to module level and use power electronics components and large capacitors, require to disconnect the PV module from the rest of the system and long measurement times. This works proposes a methodology, that is able to take partial measurements of individual PV modules and recompose their characteristics with only small capacitors in the range of tens of microfarads and without power electronics components. The monitoring methodology is able to measure individual PV modules without modifying the electrical interconnection circuit and to deviate the operating point to +/-0.3 A and 5 V in less than 5 ms. From this deviation, the system recomposes the PV module I-V characteristics with accuracies that are between 1 and 3% for the region close to maximum power."
1563,I,"Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) thin films have been synthetized by cosputtering followed by a selenization treatment on Mo and transparent conductive oxide (TCO) coated soda lime glass substrates, such as ZnO:Al and SnO2:F (FTO). The aims of the present work is to investigate the impact of the TCO substrates on the CZTSe growth, the reactions at the back contact and the electrical properties of solar cells. The results show that the morphology of CZTSe is affected by the TCO back contacts. It is found that TCO acts as a diffusion barrier of Na from soda lime glass to CZTSe. Thus low incorporation of Na during the annealing could explain the difference in grain size of CZTSe deposited on TCO. Moreover it is evidenced chemical reactions between TCO and CZTSe which affects the interface. While the efficiency up to 8% is obtained for CZTSe based solar cells deposited on Mo substrate, the efficiency drops to 2.3% for the solar cells deposited on FTO. The low efficiency is explained by the recombination at the back contact due to the formation of the ZnO secondary phase at the CZTSe/FTO interface."
1564,J,"The Suzuki-Miyaura reaction is a cornerstone method for sp(2)-sp(2) cross-coupling in industry. There has been a concerted effort to enable the use of Ni catalysis as an alternative to Pd in order to mitigate cost and improve sustainability. Despite significant advances, ligand development for Ni-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling remains underdeveloped when compared to Pd and, as a consequence, ligands for Ni-catalyzed processes are typically taken from the Pd arena. In this study we evaluate the effect of using a similar Ni and Pd precatalyst based on a common bidentate ligand (dppf) in a head-to-head format for the most common type of biaryl couplings, establishing the practical implications of direct replacement of Pd with Ni, and identifying the potential origins of these observations in a mechanistic context."
1565,J,"Ethionamide (ETH) is one of the most widely used second-line chemotherapeutic drugs for the treatment of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis. The bioactivation and activity of ETH is dramatically potentiated by a family of molecules called """"boosters"""" among which BDM43266 is one of the most potent. However, the co-administration of these active molecules is hampered by their low solubility in biological media and by the strong tendency of ETH to crystallize. A novel strategy that involves synthesizing a codrug able to self-associate into nanoparticles prone to be taken up by infected macrophages is proposed here. This codrug is designed by tethering N-hydroxymethyl derivatives of both ETH and its booster through a glutaric linker. This codrug self-assembles into nanoparticles of around 200 nm, stable upon extreme dilution without disaggregating as well as upon concentration. The nanoparticles of the codrug can be intranasally administered overcoming the unfavorable physico-chemical profiles of the parent drugs. Intrapulmonary delivery of the codrug nanoparticles to Mtb infected mice via the intranasal route at days 7, 9, 11, 14, 16 and 18 post-infection reduces the bacterial load in the lungs by a factor of 6."
1566,J,We introduce a chemoenzymatic strategy for straightforward in vitro generation of C- terminally linked fusion proteins. Tubulin tyrosine ligase is used for the incorporation of complementary click chemistry handles facilitating subsequent formation of functional bispecific antibody- fragments. This simple strategy may serve as central conjugation hub for a modular protein ligation platform.
1567,J,Controlling the activity of biomolecules with light-triggered photocages is an important research tool in the life sciences. We describe here a coumarin photocage that unusually combines the biocompatible optical properties of strong absorption at a long wavelength close to 500 nm and high photolysis quantum yields. The favourable properties are achieved by synthetically installing on the photocage scaffold a diethyl amino styryl moiety and a thionoester group rather than the lactone typical for coumarins. The photocage's photophysics are analysed with microsecond transient absorption spectroscopy to reveal the nature of the excited state in the photolysis pathway. The excited state is found to be strongly dependent on solvent polarity with a triplet state formed in DMSO and a charge-separated state in water that is likely due to aggregation. A long triplet lifetime is also correlated with a high photolysis quantum yield. Our study on the biocompatible photocage reveals fundamental insight for designing advanced photocages such as longer wavelengths in different solvent conditions tailored for applications in basic and applied research.
1568,J,"We describe the first chemical synthesis of a functional mutant of the DNA binding domain of the oncoprotein MYC, using two alternative strategies which involve either one or two Native Chemical Ligations (NCLs). Both routes allowed the efficient synthesis of a miniprotein which is capable of heterodimerizing with MAX, and replicate the DNA binding of the native protein. The versatility of the reported synthetic approach enabled the straightforward preparation of MYC and Omomyc analogues, as well as fluorescently labeled derivatives."
1569,J,"A novel fluorescent aryl-extended phenoxycalix[4]pyrrole ditopic sensor with enhanced cation recognition properties was efficiently synthesized via click chemistry and characterized through both molecular fluorescence and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Results demonstrate the selectivity of this fluorescent sensor for fluoride when taking into account its interaction with anions, while its cation binding properties showed selectivity for iron, and its sensing properties for several cations in dimethylsulfoxide. This work introduces a new ditopic receptor able to complex major environmentally relevant species and depicts the importance of click chemistry in the introduction of new tetra-chromophoric calix[4]pyrrole binding platforms with specific photophysical properties."
1570,J,"Synergistic palladium and enamine catalysis was explored to promote ketone addition to unactivated olefins. A secondary amine-based organocatalyst was identified as the optimal co-catalyst for the directed Pd-catalyzed alkene activation. Furthermore, asymmetric hydrocarbon functionalization of unactivated alkenes was also achieved with good to excellent yield (up to 96% yields) and stereoselectivity (up to 96% ee). This strategy presented an efficient approach to prepare alpha-branched ketone derivatives under mild conditions."
1571,J,"Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations using a consistent methodology accounting for solvation, dispersion and thermal effects have been used to study C-H activation of the simple directing group substrate 2-phenylpyridine (a-H). The computational model uses acetate (-OAc) and benzene to represent the carboxylate and arene co-ligands coordinated at a Ru organometallic complex. A variety of different mechanisms ranging from cationic to neutral, ion-paired, arene free, two substrates bound, and solvent (MeCN) coordinated have been explored. Computed results indicate that the cationic pathways from """"B+"""", [(C6H6)Ru(OAc)(a-H)](+), and """"D+ (eta(6))"""", [(eta(6)-a-H)Ru(OAc)(a-H)](+), involve the lowest overall barriers to C-H activation. Consideration of solvent coordination leads to a complex variety of isomers and conformers. Here a neutral pathway with either one or two acetonitriles coordinated to the Ru centre give very low barriers to C-H activation."

1573,J,"Mutasynthetic supplementation of the AHBA blocked mutant strain of S. hygroscopicus, the geldanamycin producer, with 21 aromatic and heteroaromatic amino acids provided new nonquinoid geldanamycin derivatives. Large scale (5 L) fermentation provided four new derivatives in sufficient quantity for full structural characterisation. Among these, the first thiophene derivative of reblastatin showed strong antiproliferative activity towards several human cancer cell lines. Additionally, inhibitory effects on human heat shock protein Hsp90 alpha and bacterial heat shock protein from H. pylori HpHtpG were observed, revealing strong displacement properties for labelled ATP and demonstrating that the ATP-binding site of Hsps is the target site for the new geldanamycin derivatives."
1574,J,"Numerous studies demonstrate the promise of opioid peptides as analgesics, but poor oral bioavailability has limited their therapeutic development. This study sought to increase the oral bioavailability of opioid peptides by cyclization, using Hantzsch-based macrocyclization strategies to produce two new series of cyclized DAMGO and Leu/Met-enkephalin analogs. Opioid receptor affinity and selectivity for compounds in each series were assessed in vitro with radioligand competition binding assays. Compounds demonstrated modest affinity but high selectivity for the mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors (MOR, DOR and KOR), while selectivity for mu opioid receptors varied by structure. Antinociceptive activity of each compound was initially screened in vivo following intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration and testing in the mouse 55 degrees C warm-water tail-withdrawal test. The four most active compounds were then evaluated for dose-and time-dependent antinociception, and opioid receptor selectivity in vivo. Cyclic compounds 1924-10, 1936-1, 1936-7, and 1936-9 produced robust and long-lasting antinociception with ED50 values ranging from 0.32-0.75 nmol following i.c.v. administration mediated primarily by mu- and delta-opioid receptor agonism. Compounds 1924-10, 1936-1 and 1936-9 further displayed significant time-dependent antinociception after oral (10 mg kg(-1), p.o.) administration. A higher oral dose (30 mg kg(-1). p.o.) of all four cyclic peptides also reduced centrally-mediated respiration, suggesting successful penitration into the CNS. Overall, these data suggest cyclized opioid peptides synthesized by a Hantzsch-based macrocyclization strategy can retain opioid agonist activity to produce potent antinociception in vivo while conveying improved bioavailability following oral administration."
1575,J,"The Pictet-Spengler reaction of tryptophan esters and aldehydes has been widely applied in natural product synthesis and medicinal chemistry. To date, the trans- or cis-configuration of 1,3-disubstituted tetrahydro-beta-carbolines (TH beta Cs) formed in this reaction has most often been assigned based on the relative C-13 chemical shifts of C1 and C3 in the diastereomers. Although the upfield shifts of C1 and C3 in trans-TH beta Cs relative to cis-TH beta Cs has been attributed to steric compression associated with the """"gamma-gauche"""" effect, we show that this effect is not borne out experimentally for other carbons that should suffer this same compression. Thus we developed a robust alternative method for stereochemical assignment based on H-1 NMR coupling constants (31 examples) and supported by extensive DFT-based conformational analysis and calculation of H-1-H-1 coupling constants. DFT calculations of C-13 NMR chemical shifts also cast doubt upon the role of the """"gamma-gauche"""" effect on C1 and C3 chemical shifts in trans-TH beta Cs."
1576,J,"Despite the advantages of photodynamic therapy (PDT) over chemotherapy or radiotherapy such as low side effects, lack of treatment resistance and spatial selectivity inherent to light activation of the drug, several limitations especially related to the photosensitiser (PS) prevent PDT from becoming widespread in oncology. Herein, new folic acid-and biotin-conjugated PSs for tumour-targeting PDT are reported, with promising properties related to PDT such as intense absorption following one-photon excitation in the red or two-photon excitation in the near-infrared, and also high singlet oxygen quantum yield (close to 70% in DMSO). Cellular studies demonstrated that both targeted PSs induced phototoxicity, the folate-targeted PS being the most effective one with 80% of cell death following 30 min of irradiation and a phototoxicity four times higher than that of the non-targeted PS. This result is in accordance with the uptake of the folate-targeted PS in HeLa cells, mediated by the folate receptors. Moreover, this folate-targeted PS was also phototoxic following two-photon excitation at 920 nm, opening new perspectives for highly selective PDT treatment of small and deep tumours."
1577,J,"Fluorinated carbohydrates have been employed as probes for fundamental studies of protein-carbohydrate interactions, but also in the development of mechanism-based enzyme inhibitors.

Here we report the synthesis and characterisation of novel vicinal dideoxy-difluorinated D-galactoses with fluorination at the 3,4-positions, and at the 2,3-positions, the latter in both the pyranose and furanose forms. This includes a successful pyranose-into-furanose isomerisation protocol."
1578,J,"Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are becoming important drugs for hard to treat diseases. Modifications to their DNA backbones are essential to inhibit degradation in vivo, but they can reduce binding affinity to RNA targets. To address this problem we have combined the enzymatic resistance of carbamate (CBM) DNA backbone analogues with the thermodynamic stability conferred by locked nucleic acid sugars (LNA). Using a dinucleotide phosphoramidite strategy and automated solid phase synthesis, we have synthesised a set of oligonucleotides modified with multiple LNA-CBM units. The LNA sugars restore binding affinity to RNA targets, and in this respect LNA position with respect to the CBM linkage is important. Oligonucleotides containing carbamate flanked on its 5' and 3'-sides by LNA form stable duplexes with RNA and unstable duplexes with DNA, which is desirable for antisense applications. Carbamate-LNA modified oligonucleotides also show increased stability in the presence of snake venom and foetal bovine serum compared to LNA or CBM backbones alone."
1579,J,"Lacto-N-biose 1,2-oxazoline was prepared chemo-enzymatically and shown to be a donor substrate for beta-1,3-glycosylation of lactose by the wild-type and glycosynthase variants (D320E, D320A, Y419F) of Bifidobacterium bifidum beta-N-hexosaminidase. Lacto-N-tetraose, a core structure of human milk oligosaccharides, was formed in 20-60% yield of donor substrate (up to 8 mM product titre), depending on the degree of selectivity control by the enzyme used."
1580,J,"A new method was developed for synthesizing 2-alkyl-2-boryl-tetrahydrofuran derivatives from aliphatic ketones using a copper(i)/N-heterocyclic carbene complex catalyst. This reaction presumably proceeds through the nucleophilic addition of a borylcopper(i) intermediate to ketone, followed by intramolecular substitution of the resulting alkoxide for the halide leaving group. The new borylation products, 2-alkyl-2-boryl-tetrahydrofuran derivatives with a condensed structure around the C-B bond, cannot be synthesized by other methods."
1581,J,"Bioorthogonal decaging reactions are a promising strategy for prodrug activation because they involve bond cleavage to release a molecule of interest. The trans-cyclooctene (TCO)-tetrazine inverse electron-demand Diels-Alder reaction has been widely applied in vivo for decaging of amine prodrugs, however, the release of alcohol-containing bioactive compounds has been less well studied. Here, we report a TCO-carbamate benzyl ether self-immolative linker for the release of OH-molecules upon reaction with a tetrazine trigger. The benzyl ether linker proved to be highly stable and can rapidly liberate alcohols under physiological conditions upon reaction with tetrazines. The mechanism and decaging yield were systematically examined by fluorescence and HPLC analysis by using a fluorogenic TCO-benzyl ether-coumarin probe and different 3,6-substituted tetrazine derivatives. This study revealed that decaging occurs rapidly (t(1/2) = 27 min) and the cycloaddition step happens within seconds (t(1/2) = 7 s) with reaction rates of approximate to 100 M-1 s(-1). Importantly, the reaction is compatible with living organisms as demonstrated by the decaging of a prodrug of the antibacterial compound triclosan in the presence of live E. Coli, that resulted in complete cell killing by action of the released OH-active drug. Overall, this work describes a new linker for masking alcohol functionality that can be rapidly reinstated through tetrazine-triggered decaging."

1583,J,"We investigate the self-assembly of a palmitoylated (C16-chain at the N terminus) peptide fragment in comparison to the unlipidated peptide EELNRYY, a fragment of the gut hormone peptide PYY3-36. The lipopeptide C16-EELNRYY shows remarkable pH-dependent self-assembly above measured critical aggregation concentrations, forming fibrils at pH 7, but micelles at pH 10. The parent peptide does not show self-assembly behaviour. The lipopeptide forms hydrogels at sufficiently high concentration at pH 7, the dynamic mechanical properties of which were measured. We also show that the tyrosine functionality at the C terminus of EELNRYY can be used to enzymatically produce the pigment melanin. The enzyme tyrosinase oxidises tyrosine into 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), DOPA-quinone and further products, eventually forming eumelanin. This is a mechanism of photo-protection in the skin, for this reason controlling tyrosinase activity is a major target for skin care applications and EELNRYY has potential to be developed for such uses."
1584,J,"A one-pot approach for ortho-coupling of arenes with non-actived N-nucleophiles has been developed using sequential iron and copper catalysis. Regioselective ortho-activation of anisoles, anilines and phenols was achieved through iron( III) triflimide catalysed iodination, followed by a copper( I)-catalysed, ligand-assisted coupling reaction with N-heterocycle, amide and sulfonamide-based nucleophiles. The synthetic utility of this one-pot, two-step method for the direct amination of ortho-aryl C-H bonds was demonstrated with the late-stage functionalisation of 3,4-dihydroquinolin-2-ones. This allowed the preparation of a TRIM24 bromodomain inhibitor and a series of novel analogues."
1585,J,"What computational methods should be used to achieve the most reliable result in computational structure elucidation? A study on the effect of quality and quantity of geometries on computational NMR structure elucidation performance is reported. Semi-empirical, HF and DFT methods were explored, and B3LYP optimized geometries in combination with mPW1PW91 shifts and M06-2X conformer energies was found to be best. The required number of conformers considered has also been investigated, as well as several methods for the reduction of this number. Clear guidelines for the best computational NMR structure elucidation methods for different levels of available computing power are provided."
1586,J,"We describe the biocompatible conjugation of the Tris base to 2-formyl and 2-acetylphenylboronic acid (abbreviated as 2-FPBA and 2-APBA respectively), which have emerged as a versatile chemotype for fast biocompatible conjugation reactions. Tris base was found to react with 2-FPBA/APBA to give oxazolidinoboronate (OzB) complexes, analogous to the thiazolidinoboronate (TzB) and imidazolidinoboronate (IzB) complex formation that we recently reported. The Tris conjugations proceed well in complex biological media, and in contrast to the TzB/IzB complexes, the Tris conjugates exhibit superior kinetic stability (dissociation over days) as well as chemical stability against oxidation. We demonstrate the utility of such conjugation chemistries via a small molecule-induced peptide cyclization in blood serum."
1587,J,"A method for (hetero)arylboration of alkynes is presented. The reaction allows for the synthesis of densely functionalized tetrasubstituted alkenes with control of regioselectivity and diastereoselectivity. The conversion of the products to the corresponding alpha,alpha-bis(hetero)arylketones is also shown."
1588,J,"Utilising a fast and sensitive screening method based on imidazolium-tagged probes, we report unprecedented reversible activity of bacterial beta 1,4-galactosyltransferases to catalyse the transgalactosylation from lactose to N-acetylglucosamine to form N-acetyllactosamine in the presence of UDP. The process is demonstrated by the preparative scale synthesis of pNP-beta-LacNAc from lactose using beta 1,4-galactosyltransferase NmLgtB-B as the only biocatalyst."
1589,J,"We have synthesised a range of thiazole orange (TO) functionalised oligonucleotides for nucleic acid detection in which TO is attached to the nucleobase or sugar of thymidine. The properties of duplexes between TO-probes and their DNA and RNA targets strongly depend on the length of the linker between TO and the oligonucleotide, the position of attachment of TO to the nucleotide (major or minor groove) and the mode of attachment of thiazole orange (via benzothiazole or quinoline moiety). This information can be used to design probes for detection of target nucleic acids by fluorescence or duplex melting. With cellular imaging in mind we show that 2 '-OMe RNA probes with TO at the 5-position of uracil or the 2 '-position of the ribose sugar are particularly effective, exhibiting up to 44-fold fluorescence enhancement against DNA and RNA, and high duplex stability. Excellent mismatch discrimination is achieved when the mispaired base is located adjacent to the TO-modified nucleotide rather than opposite to it. The simple design, ease of synthesis and favourable properties of these TO probes suggest applications in fluorescent imaging of DNA and RNA in a cellular context."
1590,J,"In contrast to many other water-soluble peptide arrangements, the formation of a triple helix in collagen proceeds inside out: polar glycyl residues form the interior, whereas nonpolar prolyl side chains constitute the exterior. In our work, we decided to exploit this aspect of the peptide architecture in order to create hyperstable collagen mimicking peptides (CMPs). The key element of this study is the environment. Given that the peptide assembles in a nonpolar medium, the collapse of the polar peptide backbone into the triple helix should become more favorable. Following this idea, we prepared CMPs based on hydrophobic proline analogues. The synthesis was performed by a combination of liquid-and solid-phase approaches: first, hexapeptides were prepared in solution, and then these were launched into conventional Fmoc-based peptide synthesis on a solid support. The resulting peptides showed an excellent signal of the triple helix in the model nonpolar solvent (octanol) according to circular dichroism observations. In a study of a series of oligomers, we found that the minimal length of the peptides required for triple helical assembly is substantially lower compared to water-soluble CMPs. Our results suggest further explorations of the CMPs in hydrophobic media; in particular, we highlight the suggestion that collagen could be converted into a membrane protein."
1591,J,"A gold-catalysed post-Ugi chemo- and diastereoselective cascade dearomative spirocyclization/1,6-addition sequence is disclosed for the synthesis of diverse fused polyheterocyclic scaffolds bearing indole, pyrrole, benzothiophene, furan or electron-rich arene moieties from easily available building blocks. The effectiveness and efficiency of this diversity-oriented approach has been proved in the rapid construction of 28 fused polyheterocyclic scaffolds with a good building-block variability and structural complexity in two operational steps."
1592,D,"Consumer behavior changes differently in emergencies. Understanding consumer food stockpiling behavior during COVID-19 pandemic can provide critical information for governments and policymakers to adjust inventory and response strategies. This paper analyzed consumer food stockpiling behavior, including the change of food reserve scale and willingness to pay for fresh food reserves in COVID-19. Our paper shows that the scale of food reserve extends from 3.37 to 7.37 days after the outbreak of COVID-19; if available, consumers on average are willing to pay 18.14 yuan (60.47%) premium for fresh products reserves. The result shows that food stockpiling behavior is fueled by a set of multiple motivations and subjective risk perception. Female, high education level and high-income consumers were more likely to reserve larger scale food reserves, but consumers' willingness to pay for fresh food reserves is determined by income. This study was conducted when new infection cases continued to rise in the world. The story of food stockpiling during the COVID-19 pandemic in China is similar with the rest of world. Consumer stockpiling behavior in China can also be expanded to other countries to predict the change of food demand and understand more about consumer preferences in emergencies."
1593,D,"In response to COVID-19, seed security interventions are being planned to help bolster fragile livelihoods. After 25 years of research during emergencies, there are many lessons to build on, including that seed systems, especially informal markets, prove fairly resilient and often function even in high stress contexts. As a wise first step, given the possible volatility in supply, farmers' seed saving should be supported actively and at scale. Rigorous remote assessments will have to become the new norm for gauging seed security, with reviews recognizing that different crops might be affected in different ways by specific seed channel stress or breakdown. Well-known short-term seed security responses, for example, Direct Seed Distribution, will need to be tailored to the new COVID-19 reality, particularly in terms of altering logistics. More fundamentally, three new factors might herald a transformation in response: 1) Choice for farmers has to be the operative principle (especially as markets may fluctuate quickly); 2) Remote two-way 'state of the art' communication has to be built rapidly; and 3) Seed quality options might need to be liberalized, especially given the scale of possible seed security intervention. Covid-19 effects will likely linger several years or potentially six to nine seasons (depending on agricultural calendar). Now might be the time to move from stop-gap responses (and repetitive ones) to more sustainable and powerful market-led support, with particular emphasis on responses that leverage and strengthen the informal sector markets."
1594,D,"Smallholder maize growers are experiencing significant yield gaps due to sub-optimal agricultural practices. Adequate agricultural inputs, particularly nutrient amendments and best management practices, are essential to reverse this trend. There is a need to understand the cause of variations in maize yield, provide reliable early estimates of yields, and make necessary recommendations for fertilizer applications. Maize yield prediction and estimates of yield gaps using objective and spatial analytical tools could provide accurate and objective information that underpin decision support. A study was conducted in Rwanda at Nyakiliba sector and Gashora sector located in Birunga and Central Bugesera agro-ecological zones, with the objectives of (1) determining factors influencing maize yield, (2) predicting maize yield (using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) approach), and (3) assessing the maize yield gaps and the impact on food security. Maize grain yield was significantly higher at Nyakiliba (1.74 t ha(-1)) than at Gashora (0.6 t ha(-1)). NDVI values correlated positively with maize grain yield at both sites (R-2 = 0.50 to 0.65) and soil fertility indicators (R-2 = 0.55 to 0.70). Maize yield was highest at 40 kg P ha(-1)and response to N fertilizer was adequately simulated at Nyakiliba (R-2 = 0.85, maximum yield 3.3 t ha(-1)). Yield gap was 4.6 t ha(-1)in Nyakiliba and 5.1 t ha(-1)in Gashora. Soil variables were more important determinants of social class than family size. Knowledge that low nutrient inputs are a major cause of yield gaps in Rwanda should prioritize increasing the rate of fertilizer use in these agricultural systems."
1595,D,"This study examined the use of the household dietary diversity score (HDDS) to assess household nutrient adequacy in Ethiopia. It also examined the correlates of HDDS following the food systems framework. Results show that the average nutrient consumption in Ethiopia varies by place of residence and by income profile, where households in urban areas and those in the higher income quintiles rank favorably. Among 13 nutrients under study, we found nutrient inadequacy for fat, calcium, zinc, riboflavin, niacin, folate, vitamin C and vitamin A ranging between 46% and 89%, and the prevalence of inadequacy for vitamin B12 to be up to 100%. Econometric results showed that HDDS is a strong predictor of a household's mean probability of nutrient adequacy (MPA), and that an HDDS of 10 is the minimum threshold at which HDDS can improve household MPA. We found suggestive evidence within the food systems that improving household-incomes, access to health and transport services are beneficial to improve HDDS and nutrient consumption in Ethiopia."
1596,D,"Widespread food insecurity remains a daunting challenge in Africa, despite significant gains in global efforts to eliminate hunger over the last three decades. This paper examines the effects of easing trade across borders - through reductions in documents, time, and costs to export and import - on food security outcomes in Africa. To control for endogeneity, this paper employs the first-difference instrumental variable estimator based on panel data covering 45 African countries over the period 2006-2015. The results reveal that poor trade facilitation constitutes a significant driver of food insecurity in Africa. In particular, ineffective trade facilitation is associated with significant increments in the prevalence of undernourishment and depth of food deficit, as well as reductions in dietary energy supply adequacy and access to sanitation facilities. The results show that food availability and food access are significantly hampered by higher documentation requirements and lengthier export and import times. The results suggest that reductions in delays from documentary and border compliance promise to be the most effective trade facilitation reforms to enhance food security in Africa."
1597,D,"The International Potato Center (CIP) genebank conserves and facilitates access to highly diverse germplasm of potato, sweetpotato, and Andean roots and tubers as a global public good for food security. While it is generally understood that material from the CIP genebank has played an important role in the release of many CIP-related varieties grown by smallholder farmers in lower-income countries, the contribution has not been evaluated in quantitative terms. By applying the relative contribution of provenance based on pedigree data, we apportion the CIP genebank contribution of two released potato varieties: Pallay Poncho and Victoria. The estimated contribution of the CIP genebank to Pallay Poncho and Victoria is 35% and 72%, respectively. We then used an economic surplus approach to measure Victoria's benefits in Uganda by attributing and valuing productivity gains. The gross benefit of Victoria in Uganda is estimated at USD $1.04 billion (2016 value), which exceeds the annual operating cost of the entire genebank over its lifetime. Seventy-two percent of the economic benefits corresponding to germplasm of Victoria are due to the CIP genebank contribution. Our findings demonstrate the magnitude of economic benefits generated by the use of conserved germplasm provided by the CIP genebank in crop improvement, which is only one of the several components of its total economic value. These results show that the availability of diverse germplasm is perhaps one of the most important elements in varietal development."
1598,D,"This opinion article results from a collective analysis by the Editorial Board of Food Security. It is motivated by the ongoing covid-19 global epidemic, but expands to a broader view on the crises that disrupt food systems and threaten food security, locally to globally. Beyond the public health crisis it is causing, the current global pandemic is impacting food systems, locally and globally. Crises such as the present one can, and do, affect the stability of food production. One of the worst fears is the impacts that crises could have on the potential to produce food, that is, on the primary production of food itself, for example, if material and non-material infrastructure on which agriculture depends were to be damaged, weakened, or fall in disarray. Looking beyond the present, and not minimising its importance, the covid-19 crisis may turn out to be the trigger for overdue fundamental transformations of agriculture and the global food system. This is because the global food system does not work well today: the number of hungry people in the world has increased substantially, with the World Food Programme warning of the possibility of a """"hunger pandemic"""". Food also must be nutritious, yet unhealthy diets are a leading cause of death. Deepening crises impoverish the poorest, disrupt food systems, and expand """"food deserts"""". A focus on healthy diets for all is all the more relevant when everyone's immune system must react to infection during a global pandemic. There is also accumulating and compelling evidence that the global food system is pushing the Earth system beyond the boundaries of sustainability. In the past twenty years, the growing demand for food has increasingly been met through the destruction of Earth's natural environment, and much less through progress in agricultural productivity generated by scientific research, as was the case during the two previous decades. There is an urgent need to reduce the environmental footprint of the global food system: if its performances are not improved rapidly, the food system could itself be one main cause for food crises in the near future. The article concludes with a series of recommendations intended for policy makers and science leaders to improve the resilience of the food system, global to local, and in the short, medium and long term."
1599,D,"Short term food security issues require reliable crop forecasting data to identify the population at risk of food insecurity and quantify the anticipated food deficit. The assessment of the current early warning and crop forecasting system which was designed in mid 80's identified a number of deficiencies that have serious impact on the timeliness and reliability of the data. We developed a new method to forecast maize yield across smallholder farmers' fields in Tanzania (Morogoro, Kagera and Tanga districts) by integrating field-based survey with a process-based mechanistic crop simulation model. The method has shown to provide acceptable forecasts (r(2) values of 0.94, 0.88 and 0.5 in Tanga, Morogoro and Kagera districts, respectively) 14-77 days prior to crop harvest across the three districts, in spite of wide range of maize growing conditions (final yields ranged from 0.2-5.9 t/ha). This study highlights the possibility of achieving accurate yield forecasts, and scaling up to regional levels for smallholder farming systems, where uncertainties in management conditions and field size are large."
1600,D,"Taking a food systems approach is a promising strategy for improving diets. Implementing such an approach would require the use of a comprehensive set of metrics to characterize food systems, set meaningful goals, track food system performance, and evaluate the impacts of food system interventions. Food system metrics are also useful to structure debates and communicate to policy makers and the general public. This paper provides an updated analytical framework of food systems and uses this to identify systematically relevant metrics and indicators based on data availability in low and middle income countries. We conclude that public data are relatively well available for food system drivers and outcomes, but not for all of the food system activities. With only minor additional investments, existing surveys could be extended to cover a large part of the required additional data. For some indicators, however, targeted data collection efforts are needed. As the list of indicators partly overlaps with the indicators for the Sustainable Development Goals (SGDs), part of the collected data could serve not only to describe and monitor food systems, but also to track progress towards attaining the SDGs."
1601,D,"Small island states have features in common which make it difficult for them to assure food security through self-production, notably limited land, fresh water and labour. As these island states grow economically, diet diversification by an increasingly affluent population demands a balance between food imports and self-production. Singapore, a wealthy, small island state has consistently been ranked high in food security in international comparisons, but only under conditions when trade is uninhibited and countries do not reduce food exports. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown vulnerabilities in the country's """"Resilience"""" strategy to maintain food security through importing over 90% of its food needs from over 170 countries. Leading up to and during the pandemic, strategic policy initiatives were announced by the government and new measures were taken to increase the stability of imports, ramp up production from existing farms, increase self-production by 300% by 2030 through increasing the number of high technology urban vegetable and fish farms, and factory-cultured food, and reducing food waste. Singapore offers lessons for other small island states in ways to improve their food security."
1602,D,"The COVID-19 crisis has exposed the vulnerability of India's Agri food system and accentuated the need for agricultural market reforms and digital solutions to connect farmers to markets, to create safety nets and ensure reasonable working conditions, and to decentralize Agri food systems to make them more resilient."
1603,D,"While literature has noted the presence of a nutrition transition in terms of changing nutrition outcomes in Vietnam, very limited evidence linking changes in upstream food system factors to downstream diet and nutrition changes exists. Combining available data from different sources and analyzing it through a conceptual food systems framework, our study examines different pathways of nutrition transition through food supply, food prices, household food expenditures, diets, and nutrition outcomes in Vietnam. Our findings show that while Vietnam is at the start of its nutrition transition, change is happening rapidly. Undernutrition is falling, obesity is rising, and nutrition-related chronic diseases account for a significant burden of diseases and death. In terms of changes in healthful foods, the supply of vegetables and fruits is plentiful, and expenditure on vegetables remains consistent and small. Notably however, vegetable consumption has dropped, and increasing meat and milk consumption have been double-edged swords for nutrition. In terms of foods associated with the negative sides of the nutrition transition, the availability of sweets and sweetened beverages has risen in recent years, with oils and fats rising less. The expenditure share on food eaten away from home, in many contexts a marker for less healthful diets, has increased over time. While these changes are typical of a nutrition transition, Vietnam is also somewhat of an outlier in some respects: wet markets and daily fresh food purchases continue to dominate food purchasing behaviour, and food eaten away from home means a different thing in a country renowned for its diverse and healthy street food and roadside restaurant culture. While this study brings together important data on the food system drivers of a nutrition transition in Vietnam, it cannot link each of these issues into a standard statistical model of change due to data gaps at different levels, calling for data collection improvement in future diet and food systems research. Vietnamese health policy explicitly acknowledges nutrition transition issues, with targets for obesity reduction. This work on the food system drivers of the nutrition transition points to the need to further adapt policy in other sectors beyond health, however. At the same time as making nutrient-rich foods more accessible, nutrient-poor or ultra-processed foods need to be made less accessible and desirable if additional income is to contribute to a healthy diet in limiting Vietnam's emerging nutrition transition."
1604,D,"COVID-19 has had an instant effect on food systems in developing countries. Restrictions to the movement of people and goods have impaired access to markets, services and food. Unlike other concurrent crises, rather than threatening the material hardware of food systems, COVID-19 has so far affected the 'software' of food systems, highlighting again that connectivity is at the heart of these systems. Drops in demand, the loss of markets and employment and growing concerns about international cooperation are indications of possible deeper disruptions to come. Amidst this uncertainty, strategies to safeguard food and nutrition security of the world's poor need to prioritize diversification of production and markets. Nutritious, biofortified crops such as potato, sweetpotato, but also wheat, maize and beans among others, can play a more significant role to provide key micronutrients (vitamin A, iron, zinc) at large scale. Strong local market chains, robust smallholder production systems and increasing commercial utilization make these crops powerful vehicles for securing nutrition when markets and mobility look uncertain. We posit that the evolving impacts of COVID-19 provide an opportunity to focus agricultural innovations, including the development and delivery of biofortified crops, on new and more specifically defined 'jobs to be done' throughout the food system. This will help bridge some of the current disruptions in supply and demand and will help prepare food systems for future crises."
1605,D,"India experienced a consumption puzzle since the 1970s, whereby households' calorie intakes declined over time, despite significant economic growth. This declining trend in calorie intake (consumption puzzle) was reversed for the first time in 2011-12. This is the first empirical study that investigates the relationship between refinements in data collection on food away from home (FAFH) and the trend reversal in per capita calorie intake decline in India. Findings from the study showed that the declining trend in calorie intake in India has been partly due to measurement issues and that correcting for these issues through refinements in data collection for FAFH in 2011-12 had a positive effect on the reversal of the calorie intake decline. India uses per capita calorie intake estimated using data from HCES to define the official poverty line, a benchmark used in designing many social welfare programs. Incorrect estimates of calorie intake will have negative implications on the effectiveness of welfare programs aimed at reducing food insecurity. Findings from this study provide insights for further improvement in data collection regarding household-level consumption expenditures. The study has implications not only for India but also for other countries that use household-level consumption data to understand diets and to design food and nutrition programs."
1606,D,"The extreme poverty line is the most commonly used benchmark for poverty, set at US$ 1.90 by the World Bank. Another benchmark, based on the Anker living wage methodology, is the remuneration received for a standard work week necessary for a worker to meet his/her family's basic needs in a particular place. The living wage concept has been used extensively to address incomes of plantation workers producing agricultural commodities for international markets. More recently intense discussion has emerged concerning the 'living income' of smallholder farmers who produce commodities for international supply chains on their own land. In this article we propose a simple method that can be used in all types of development projects to benchmark a rural 'living income'. We launch the Living Income Methodology, as adapted from the Living Wage Methodology, to estimate the living income for rural households. In any given location this requires about one week of fieldwork. We express it per adult equivalent per day (AE/day) and data collection is focused on rural households and their immediate surroundings. Our three case studies showed that in 2017 in Lushoto District, rural Tanzania, the living income was US$ PPP 4.04/AE/day, in Isingiro District, rural Uganda, 3.82 and in Sidama Zone, rural Ethiopia, 3.60. In all cases, the extreme poverty line of US$ PPP 1.90 per capita per day is insufficient to meet the basic human rights for a decent living in low-income countries. The Living Income Methodology provides a transparent local benchmark that can be used to assess development opportunities of rural households, by employers in rural areas, including farmers hiring in labour, while respecting basic human rights on a decent living. It can be used to reflect on progress of rural households in low-income countries on their aspired path out of poverty. It further provides a meaningful benchmark to measure progress on Sustainable Development Goal 1, eliminating poverty, and 2, zero hunger and sustainable food systems, allowing for consideration of the local context."
1607,D,"Since the early 2000s, agricultural input subsidy programs (ISPs) have again become a popular agricultural development policy tool in sub-Saharan Africa. Although many of the programs include as objectives raising incomes and reducing poverty among smallholder farmers, there is limited empirical evidence on whether ISPs are achieving these goals. Focusing on the case of Zambia, we use nationally-representative household panel survey data to estimate the effects of ISP fertilizer and hybrid maize seed on smallholder farm household welfare. Results suggest that during the years of analysis, Zambia's ISP reduced the poverty headcount ratio and poverty severity among these farm households by 1.5 and 9.0 percentage points, respectively. We found little evidence of spillover effects on households not directly participating in the program. However, we found some evidence of heterogeneous direct program effects: welfare improvements resulting from the ISP are greatest for households with farm sizes of 1-5 ha, female-headed households, and households with relatively older heads."
1608,I,"Solar irradiance nowcasts can be derived with sky images from all sky imagers (ASI) by detecting and analyzing transient clouds, which are the main contributor of intra-hour solar irradiance variability. The accuracy of ASI based solar irradiance nowcasting systems depends on various processing steps. Two vital steps are the cloud height detection and cloud tracking. This task is challenging, due to the atmospheric conditions that are often complex, including various cloud layers moving in different directions simultaneously. This challenge is addressed by detecting and tracking individual clouds. For this, we developed two distinct ASI nowcasting approaches with four or two cameras and a third hybridized approach. These three systems create individual 3-D cloud models with unique attributes including height, position, size, optical properties and motion. This enables us to describe complex multi-layer conditions. In this paper, derived cloud height and motion vectors are compared with a reference ceilometer (height) and shadow camera system (motion) over a 30 day validation period. The validation data set includes a wide range of cloud heights, cloud motion patterns and atmospheric conditions. Furthermore, limitations of ASI based nowcasting systems due to image resolution and image perspective constrains are discussed. The most promising system is found to be the hybridized approach. This approach uses four ASIs and a voxel carving based cloud modeling combined with a cloud segmentation independent stereoscopic cloud height and tracking detection. We observed for this approach an overall mean absolute error of 648 m for the height, 1.3 m/s for the cloud speed and 16.2 degrees for the motion direction."
1609,I,"This article demonstrates the feasibility of using a phase change material (PCM) in a solar stove for storing energy. The PCM is a material that is able of absorbing and liberating great amounts of energy upon solidification and melting due to its superior latent heat storage capability. In this study, small capsules, used as PCM storage units in the solar stove, were constructed from aluminum and tested for solar energy storage during shiny days. The capsules were placed in a receiver of a parabolic reflector to absorb heat from the reflected sunlight of the parabolic reflector, which was stored as latent heat in the PCM. Acetamide of commercial grade was used as the material for latent heat storage. The solar stove with the PCM storage units had been experimentally tested. The thermal performance was analyzed during idle condition of the fan and at three rates of air flow. The temperature of the PCM capsules decreased rapidly during the first few minutes as the temperature of cooking pan increased at the same rate, and then the two temperatures matched and decreased slowly. The rate of change was higher with increasing air flow rate. Energy effectiveness between the PCM tubes and air flow increased with increasing air flow rate. The results supply significant information to design a prototype of solar stove provided with a good thermal performance material utilized for storing thermal energy."
1610,I,"The application of photovoltaics (PV) has broadened into urban environments, which has different condition from rural environments, where generally PV power plants are installed. In order to develop solar cells for urban application, we should find the answers to two questions with dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). One is current flat module design is really optimized for all solar cell types. The other is, if not, how to find the optimized module design. The power output from solar cells according to light incident angle has two types: one is linear to cosine law where the flat module and the other is non-linear to cosine law where 3-dimensional array of cell in the module can provide improved power output and energy density in given installed area. We have shown that DSSCs belongs to second case and non-linearity came under angled incident light by means of FDM calculation and experiments. In addition, by introducing patterns in the photoanode, light trapping effect maximized nonlinearity to the oblique incident. We have arrayed the DSSCs cells into sub-modules with oblique angle. From this simple modification, from flat 2-dimensional array to 3-dimensional array of cells, the power output and energy density increased by 30-40%, respectively."
1611,I,"In this work, we investigate how Al and Mg doped mesoporous TiO2 layers can improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with respect to undoped mesoporous TiO2, The PSC configuration used in this study consists of mesoscopic structure with CH3NH3PbI3 as the perovskite absorber. A PSC with optimized mol% of Al and Mg doped mesoporous TiO2 layers has been shown to achieve up to 22% higher efficiency than that of pure TiO2. While the Mg doping only enhances the open-circuit voltage (V-OC), the Al doping effectively enhances the V-OC, the short-circuit current density (J(SC)), and the fill factor (FF). The occupancy of the doped metals in the lattice is confirmed by XRD, EDX, and XPS. The Mg doping increases the band gap of TiO2 while the Al doping decreases it. The wide band gap in Mg doped TiO2 reduces the electron and hole recombination rate, thus increasing the J(SC) and V-OC. By Al doping, deep trap sites in the TiO2 are eliminated, and this effectively reduces the recombination losses and in turn, increases the J(SC). The enhanced electron-hole generation rate attributed to the decrease in the band gap of Al doped TiO2 also increases the J(SC). In addition, there is an enhancement on the electron mobility by the presence of Al metal and this gives an increase in the FF. The results have demonstrated the possibility of improving the PCE of PSCs by fine tuning the band gap of mesoporous TiO2."
1612,I,"The corrosion rates of AISI 316L and AISI 321H austenitic stainless steel, immersed in a stagnant isothermal mixture of 60% NaNO3 and 40% KNO3 molten salt at 550 degrees C in atmospheric air are 8.6 and 9.0 mu m/yr, respectively. The corrosion mechanism was proposed by recording the weight changes of the steel coupons at different time intervals up to 3000 h, and by the characterization of multilayer oxide scales formed on the steel surface. Multilayers made of different oxides, mainly Fe2O3 and Fe3O4, are the principal scale products. At 3000 h, the thickness of the scale layer formed on AISI 321H (7.5 +/- 2.9 mu m) is slightly higher than the one formed at the AISI 316L (6.9 +/- 2.1 mu m). This small difference might reflect the partial spallation of the corrosion layer on AISI 321H, which is seen for times longer than 1000 h. A minimal change of the composition of the molten nitrate salt is observed in time and is predominantly due to the appearance of soluble chromate products and nitrite compounds (0.004 wt% and 1.4 wt% at 3000 h, respectively). The observed corrosion behaviour of these alloys shows that they are good candidate for usage as containers of molten nitrate salts in the thermal energy storage (TES) system for a CSP plant."
1613,I,"A surface solar radiation forecast algorithm is developed using cloud physical properties from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) on board of the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) geostationary satellite. The novelty of the algorithm is the derivation of cloud motion vectors using cloud physical properties. The solar radiation forecast products include global horizontal irradiance (GHI) and direct normal irradiance (DNI). The forecast horizon is 0-4 h at a 15 min temporal resolution. The forecast is currently tested for the Netherlands at a spatial resolution of about 4 km x 6 km. Compared to measurements of the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) site of Cabauw, the root mean square error (RMSE) is about 31-44% for GHI and 59-100% for DNI at a forecast horizon of 2 h. For a forecast horizon of 15 min, the RMSE is 22-24% for GUI and 43-61% for DNI. The correlation coefficients between the forecasts and BSRN measurements are similar for GHI and DNI, and decrease from about 0.8-0.9 at 15 min to 0.45-0.75 at 2 h. The SEVIRI forecast outperforms the HARMONIE numerical weather prediction model forecast in the first 2-3 h. The quality of the forecast depends on the sky conditions: for clear-sky indices larger than 0.7, the SEVIRI GHI forecast is better than both smart persistence and the HARMONIE forecast in the first 4 h."
1614,I,"With growing demand for economic, eco-friendly, easy-manufacturing and renewable portable power source, flexible dye-sensitized solar cells (FDSSCs) exhibit a promising potential in the field of portable power sources. However, FDSSCs surfer from low conversion efficiency and poor stability, which hinder their applications. In this work, we have summarized recent development and challenges according to respective functions of their vital components (substrate, semiconductor film, sensitizer, electrolytes and counter electrode) as well as their effects on photoelectric conversion efficiency. Meanwhile, typical fabrication approaches have been analyzed for increasing the incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE). The approaches in rigid dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) for improving performance are also introduced to provide the favorable direction for accelerating FDSSCs' application in field of potable power source."
1615,I,"Solar thermal power plants with central receiver and thermal storage are expected to be one key technology in future electricity generation, because they are renewable and due to the thermal storage independent of the current solar radiation. State-of-the-art solar power plants often use molten nitrate salts as heat transfer fluid. The use of liquid sodium instead leads to lower electricity generation costs. Sodium has a high thermal conductivity and thus large heat transfer rates are possible. Hence, a smaller absorber surface is sufficient for the same thermal power. As a result, the sodium receiver achieves a higher efficiency at lower investment cost. Additionally, the aiming strategy, which reduces the peak heat flux on molten salt receivers isn't necessary for sodium. Even at high heat flux densities, the absorber tubes will be cooled sufficiently due to the high heat transfer coefficients. Therefore, the sodium receiver in this analysis is designed for one single aim point, resulting mean in a heat flux density of (q)over dot(mean) = 1.06 MW/m(2) and (q)over dot(peak) = 2.99 MW/m(2). The state-of-the-art system with molten salt considers (q)over dot(mean) = 0.51 MW/m(2) and (q)over dot(peak) = 1.0 MW/m(2). The presented techno-economic analysis of two sodium based concepts compared to a reference system with molten salt results in up to 16% lower electricity generation costs."
1616,I,"Potential photovoltaic (PV) production from vertical facades facing the four cardinal points of the compass are calculated from daily average vertical global insolation readings measured in Burgos, Spain. Ten-minute data sets are collected over forty-five months, from January 2014 to September 2017, in the experimental campaign to produce estimates of daily average insolation levels, from which the PV potential of the vertical surfaces was calculated. Given the scarcity of data on Global Vertical Insolation (GVI), the main sky-related variables were processed in four classic decomposition models (Isotropic, Circumsolar, Klucher, and Hay) to predict the insolation values. Both the experimentally measured GVI values and those calculated with the models were then compared using the statistical indicators RMSE and MBE. The results highlighted the economic viability of Building Integrated PhotoVoltaic (BIPV) facilities, even on the north-facing facades, in comparison with the horizontal facility at the same location."
1617,I,"Bifacial photovoltaic (PV) modules can increase the performance with respect to traditional PV modules because both sides of the cells, front and rear, absorb solar radiation. To assess their performance and quality, PV modules are characterized using international standards. However, currently only a draft IEC technical specification exists for bifacial PV modules and research needs to be done in order to study the indoor performance testing conditions. One of the issues that need to be addressed is how to measure bifacial PV modules correctly and analyse the different testing approaches proposed. This work outlines the indoor performance testing of c-Si bifacial modules under different module mounting setups including open rack, a structure with baffles and 3 modules. For each mounting method a white reflective rear panel of several dimensions was placed at various distances behind the module as a potential approach for a double-sided illumination characterization method. Electrical performance is also studied with a single-side illumination method with a black rear panel. The rear irradiance measurements and non-uniformity are also studied and the performance measurements are validated with a single-side illumination method. Additional rear irradiance allows P-max increment up to 20% under certain conditions. However, the rear irradiance non-uniformity needs to be improved in order to fulfil the current requirements of the draft technical specification."
1618,I,"Short-term solar forecasting models based solely on global horizontal irradiance (GHI) measurements are often unable to discriminate the forecasting of the factors affecting GHI from those that can be precisely computed by atmospheric models. This study introduces a Physics-based Smart Persistence model for Intra-hour forecasting of solar radiation (PSPI) that decomposes the forecasting of GHI into the computation of extraterrestrial solar radiation and solar zenith angle and the forecasting of cloud albedo and cloud fraction. The extraterrestrial solar radiation and solar zenith angle are accurately computed by the Solar Position Algorithm (SPA) developed at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). A cloud retrieval technique is used to estimate cloud albedo and cloud fraction from surface-based observations of GHI. With the assumption of persistent cloud structures, the cloud albedo and cloud fraction are predicted for future time steps using a two-stream approximation and a 5-min exponential weighted moving average, respectively. Our model evaluation using the long-term observations of GHI at NREL's Solar Radiation Research Laboratory (SRRL) shows that the PSPI has a better performance than the persistence and smart persistence models in all forecast time horizons between 5 and 60 min, which is more significant in cloudy-sky conditions. Compared to the persistence and smart persistence models, the PSPI does not require additional observations of various atmospheric parameters but is customizable in that additional observations, if available, can be ingested to further improve the GHI forecast. An advanced technology of cloud forecast is also expected to improve the future performance of the PSPI."
1619,I,"This work presents the exploratory experimental results of a co-located solar receiver and thermal energy storage (TES) concept based on a pool of molten glass contained in a cavity, serving as solar receiver and TES medium simultaneously. Distinctive features of the system are the direct and volumetric absorption of solar radiation by the semi-transparent glass and a stationary TES medium. Only the charge cycle was studied, without a heat-removal system. Recycled soda-lime-silica (SLS) container glass of various colors was adopted as working medium in a setup tested at the ETH's High Flux Solar Simulator (HFSS). A steady 3D heat transfer model of the experimental apparatus, which couples Monte-Carlo ray-tracing and CFD techniques, was developed and validated against the experimental results. The tests used the HFSS as the only energy source, with maximum radiative fluxes of 1.2 MW m(-2) and power input of 1.5 kW directly absorbed by the glass, which reached measured temperatures of 1300 degrees C, while the maximum temperatures -as predicted by the model- exceeded 1500 degrees C. Such conditions were maintained for 5 to 10 h and no technical problems were encountered with the containment of the hot glass melt. These preliminary results demonstrate that silicate glasses are effective volumetric absorbers of solar radiation up to temperatures exceeding 1300 degrees C."
1620,I,"Heat mitigation strategies can reduce excess heat in urban environments. These strategies, including solar reflective cool roofs and pavements, green vegetative roofs, and street vegetation, alter the surface energy balance to reduce absorption of sunlight at the surface and subsequent transfer to the urban atmosphere. The impacts of heat mitigation strategies on meteorology have been investigated in past work at the mesoscale and global scale. For the first time, we focus on the effect of heat mitigation strategies on the surface energy balance at the neighborhood scale. The neighborhood under investigation is El Monte, located in the eastern Los Angeles basin in Southern California. Using a computational fluid dynamics model to simulate micrometeorology at high spatial resolution, we compare the surface energy balance of the neighborhood assuming current land cover to that with neighborhood-wide deployment of green roof, cool roof, additional trees, and cool pavement as the four heat mitigation strategies. Of the four strategies, adoption of cool pavements led to the largest reductions in net radiation (downward positive) due to the direct impact of increasing pavement albedo on ground level solar absorption. Comparing the effect of each heat mitigation strategy shows that adoption of additional trees and cool pavements led to the largest spatial-maximum air temperature reductions at 14:00 h (1.0 and 2.0 degrees C, respectively). We also investigate how varying the spatial coverage area of heat mitigation strategies affects the neighborhood-scale impacts on meteorology. Air temperature reductions appear linearly related to the spatial extent of heat mitigation strategy adoption at the spatial scales and baseline meteorology investigated here."
1621,I,"The potential of utilizing geopolymer concrete (GPC) walls containing microencapsulated phase change material (MPCM) in buildings at different environmental conditions has been investigated. The effect of climate conditions (temperature, solar radiation) and MPCM design (shell thickness, concentration) on the energy efficiency of buildings was systematically analyzed based on numerical calculations utilizing the finite differences method with an energy balance approach. The energy efficiency of buildings was found to increase at higher levels of MPCM addition and for thicker concrete walls. When the outdoor temperature is higher than the indoor temperature, increasing the maximum solar radiation causes a higher power consumption, a lower power reduction, and accordingly a reduced energy efficiency of the buildings. Utilizing a PCM with a melting temperature close to the average outdoor and indoor temperatures has a positive effect on enhancing the energy efficiency of buildings. Numerical calculations were used to evaluate the efficiency of using GPC containing two different types of MPCM (PS-DVB/RT27 with a paraffin Rubitherm (R) RT27 core and a shell of polystyrene cross-linked with divinylbenzene and MF/PCM24 with a paraffin mixture core and a melamine formaldehyde polymer shell) at the environmental conditions of Oslo and Madrid throughout one year. It was found that a significant reduction of the annual power consumption for heating/cooling can be achieved in both Oslo and Madrid. It was also found that the wall orientation and the season have significant effects on the power consumption and power reductions. The GPC containing MPCM was found to exhibit better performance in Madrid than in Oslo. The developed model can be used as a quantitative tool to design MPCM-concrete walls in different climates."
1622,I,"This manuscript presents a performance study on a forced convection single-pass solar air heater channel with compact cross-matrix absorber (CMA) incorporating metal hollow square-tube absorbers. Four different geometries of CMA (Type I, II, III and IV) were investigated experimentally to evaluate their efficiency, pressure drops and heat transfer parameters. The experiments were conducted with uniform heat flux (indoor) and outdoor solar radiation as heat source. The air mass flow rates used were between 0.0142 kg/s and 0.0360 kg/s. Techno-economic feasibility studies were conducted using cost-benefit ratio (AC/AEG) method. Thermal efficiency of the CMA obtained by Type I with 76%, being the highest. CMA Type I also exhibited the highest temperature elevation than other configurations with 15.3 degrees C and thermal capacity of 38.7 kJ. Maximum pressure drop obtained was 1.33 Pa in turbulent condition with Reynolds number of 50,794. Type I has the advantage of high performance CMA and has comparatively lower cost-benefit ratio (AC/AEG) of 0.15 RM/kWh than other type of thermal absorbers."
1623,I,"Thermocline thermal-energy storage (TES) suffers from so-called thermocline degradation, which refers to the flattening of temperature gradients in the TES with successive charging-discharging cycles. Thermocline degradation increases the variations of the heat-transfer fluid (HTF) outflow temperatures, decreases storage utilization factors, and increases specific TES material costs. Methods that prevent or reduce thermocline degradation by changing the operation of the storage are called thermocline-control (TCC) methods. The assessment of TCC methods is the main objective of this work. Three TCC methods that were chosen for this assessment are described in this paper. Two methods, based on either extracting or injecting HTF through ports, were derived from previously published methods while the third method, based on mixing multiple HTF streams, one of which is extracted through a port, is novel. In a companion paper (Geissbuhler et al., Solar Energy, submitted 2018), the three TCC methods are assessed for air and molten salt as HTF using simulations of stand-alone storages as well as storages integrated into a concentrated solar power plant."
1624,I,"Non-uniform conditions within a PV module lead to significant energy losses in conventional topologies. Some of the energy lost due to partial shading can be recovered by installing reconfigurable modules. In order to explore the potential benefits of reconfigurable topologies in installations where non-uniform conditions are dominant, three shading scenarios are simulated throughout the year, both for reconfigurable and conventional modules. This allows the evaluation of the performance of each topology and estimation of the long-term gains. Using a cost function, which includes the additional investment cost, the energy gain can be translated to financial terms. Through this, locations where reconfigurable topologies can be beneficial, both in energy and financial terms, can be identified. The methodology is applied to the case of reconfigurable PV modules with a snake-like configuration. Simulation results show that these PV modules allow for higher energy production compared to conventional modules under all the simulated shading scenarios. However, they remain economically profitable over 20 years only in locations where partial shading is expected to occur daily, either throughout the full year or at least in the period of the year where energy generation is high."
1625,I,"The receiver at the optical-to-thermo-hydraulic interface of a Solar Tower plant needs careful optimization in the design stage to guarantee maximum yield during operation. Due to the highly transient behavior of a Solar Tower plant, evaluation of the receiver performance based on annual yield as a figure of merit is important. In this study, a novel method for the optimization of Solar Tower molten salt cavity receivers is introduced, which integrates optical, thermal, hydraulic and operational aspects. The receiver geometry, the hydraulic layout and the aiming strategy are optimized simultaneously. The optimization objective function is based on a validated simulation model that integrates a sky discretization approach for optical assessment and an Artificial Neural Network for fast system simulation. This approach allows to accelerate the transient annual assessment such that annual thermal yield can be used as figure of merit in the iterative optimization. For the latter, an Evolutionary Algorithm adapted to the problem has been applied, which allows for identifying optimized receiver configurations with reasonable computational effort. The methodology is demonstrated by means of a 55 MWth receiver and a given Heliostat Field in southern Spain. For this example, the evolution of receiver parameters during the course of the optimization and the break-down of different loss contributions are discussed. The optimized receiver configuration delivers more than 4% higher annual yield, as compared to the reference configuration based on static design considerations. The approach's applicability to different systems - external receivers, other heat transfer fluids, commercial scale system sizes - is discussed."
1626,I,"Global and regional trends indicate that energy demand will soon be covered by a widespread deployment of renewable energy sources. However, the weather and climate driven energy sources are characterized by a significant spatial and temporal variability. One of the commonly mentioned solutions to overcome the mismatch between demand and supply provided by renewable generation is a hybridization of two or more energy sources into a single power station (like wind-solar, solar-hydro or solar-wind-hydro). The operation of hybrid energy sources is based on the complementary nature of renewable sources. Considering the growing importance of such systems and increasing number of research activities in this area this paper presents a comprehensive review of studies which investigated, analyzed, quantified and utilized the effect of temporal, spatial and spatiotemporal complementarity between renewable energy sources. The review starts with a brief overview of available research papers, formulates detailed definition of major concepts, summarizes current research directions and ends with prospective future research activities. The review provides a chronological and spatial information with regard to the studies on the complementarity concept."
1627,I,"Global horizontal irradiance (GHI) estimates and forecasts are necessary for the efficient use of a naturally fluctuating energy source like solar energy. However, few forecasting methods exist for high latitudes. In this study we present the development and validation of a satellite-based GHI forecast for southern Finland, called Solis-Heliosat. The forecast is formed by combining information from the clear sky (CS) model Pvlib Solis with consecutive geostationary weather satellite imagery, using the Heliosat method. Forecasts are produced up to 4 h with a 15-min temporal resolution. The CS model, the satellite-based all-sky estimate, and the GHI forecast have been compared and validated against other methods and in situ GHI measurements. An additional comparison was made for two datasets representing a changing cloud environment. The CS model estimates had an average rMBE (relative Mean Bias Error) of -6% to 1% and a rRMSE (relative Root Mean Square Error) of 6-10%. For the all-sky estimates the rMBE was -4% to -2%, and rRMSE 2-33%. With increasing forecast time the Solis-Heliosat rMBE descends to -9% and rRMSE reaches 50% at 4 h. Solis-Heliosat performs better than the persistence forecasts in most cases, particularly in a changing cloud environment. Our study indicates the use of satellite-based forecasts as a viable tool for forecasting GHI for the solar energy industry also in the high latitudes. In high latitudes geostationary satellite-based methods are at their limit; however, the information they can provide will enable efficient solar energy production."
1628,I,"Correlations for natural convection heat loss from solar cavity receivers are widely based on isothermal surface temperature assumptions, which do not occur in practice due to the local heat balance varying with position. An open question thus exists regarding the suitability of such correlations for non-isothermal conditions. This paper addresses this issue by presenting a new Nusselt correlation developed from an experimental investigation of natural convection heat loss from a non-isothermal scale-model cylindrical cavity receiver. Cavities that are considered in this work have length-to-diameter ratios of 1 and 2, are operated at peak temperatures ranging from 355 degrees C to 650 degrees C, and exhibit temperature differences along the cavity wall between 40 degrees C and 342 degrees C. Stagnation and convection zones, as well as view factor profiles, are observed to contribute to the wall temperature distribution as the cavity is inclined downwards. An energy balance undertaken for steady state provides insight into the effects of non-uniform surface temperature distribution and inclination-dependent surface areas on radiative and convective losses. Natural convection heat loss results from this work are compared with widely-used correlations from the literature that assume isothermal wall conditions, and systematic discrepancies are observed. The proposed Nusselt correlation which accounts for the temperature non-uniformity, cavity inclination and geometric aspect ratio is evaluated against experimental data from this and other studies. It is found to produce excellent predictions of Nusselt numbers for cylindrical cavity receivers in the Grashof number range of 2.6 x 10(5) to 1.4 x 10(7)."
1629,I,"The continuously growing penetration of intermittent electricity sources will increase the future demand for dispatchable power plants, which balance out fluctuations within the electrical grids. Parabolic trough power plants with thermal energy storages could be one renewable solution for regions with a high yearly direct normal irradiance (DNI) sum, but in order to compete against other renewable as well as non-renewable technologies, the economic competitiveness must be ensured. Price reductions can be achieved for example by optimizing the plant operation. One shortcoming of state of the art plant controllers is that they only use the DNI measured at one or a few positions in the solar field. Due to the spatial variability of the DNI throughout the solar field this DNI information can be misleading. In this paper, we investigate the optimization potential of solar field control strategies with access to spatially resolved DNI information from all sky imagers (ASI). Uncertainties of the ASI system are considered by introducing additional independent spatial DNI information from a shadow camera system. The spatial and temporal DNI variability of the DNI seen by the controller is classified in distinct DNI variability classes. Two new control strategies are developed, with optimized control parameters for distinct combinations of the spatial and temporal DNI variability classes. These new variability class dependent control strategies are benchmarked in a simulation environment. A relative increase in revenue in excess of 1.9% is observed over a test period with 22 days, compared to a state of the art reference controller."
1630,I,"This study reports for the first time the use of thermoplastic hollow microspheres (THM) in combination with a perylene bisimide pigment (Paliogen (R) Black L0086 (P-black)) for the preparation of acrylic coatings with near-infrared (NIR) reflecting and cooling characteristics. VIS-NIR spectra showed that P-black solid dispersions provide reflectance values in agreement with the P-black content and its crystalline nature. The introduction of THM with average diameter of 25 +/- 5 mu m with the same weight content of P-black did not substantially affect the crystalline nature of the pigment within the organic coating even if a decreasing of the long range order in the molecular packing of the perylene chromophores emerged from XRD and solid-state NMR investigations. Noteworthy, the addition of the THM successfully contributed in the exponential raising of the solar reflectance (SR) of coated black substrates, i.e. reaching up to the 22% at the highest organic layer thickness of 255 mu m. The effective combination between THM and P-black was well reflected on the temperature of the back side of the coated surface after irradiation with a solar simulator, i.e. with a maximum cooling effect of about 6 degrees C."
1631,I,"Energy is now intrinsically linked to technological development, given it powers all such systems. The use of fossil fuels to supply the required energy is causing global environmental and health issues and is impacting on all life forms on the planet. Given increasing energy consumption, anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are consequentially increasing. Therefore, it is necessary to replace fossil fuels with renewable energies, biofuels and eco materials and related technologies and to try and find a way to develop sustainable zero emission solutions for all areas including constructions, transport and water resources. A critical and evolutionary way of thinking about the energy (and other resources) demand, management and supply is necessary because there are clear concerns about irreversible impacts to the world and a scarcity of the resources as well. Energy supplies should be mostly or entirely through renewable resources and highly efficient technologies put in place to achieve solution such as nearly Zero Energy Buildings (nZEB). At the same time, all the energy and resource use processes should be optimised in order to maximise the benefits, reduce the costs and promote stakeholders (consumers, companies or governments) network, toward a circular economy. This could be the way to supply the demand without increasing the scarcity of the resources and to simultaneously achieve environmental benefits. Therefore, it should be possible to improve productivity with the same amount of resources, by e.g. maximising the potential of smart grids and heuristically develop solutions with stakeholders. The concept of Demand Side Management (DSM) emerged after the energy crisis and it employs solutions such as reducing the daily peak load. At the same time, creating an educational grid is important to change the established paradigms, in order to promote critical thinking about the wasted resources and thinking holistically about overall consumption. This paradigm shift is changing the market, making it more competitive and reducing inefficiency by promoting the efficient use of resources including the deployment of energy storage during the periods of low consumption in daily peak shift. All these issues present a new way of thinking in the path towards sustainability, maximising the circular economy and reducing environmental impacts, making connections and using the Internet of Things to provide more information to all stakeholders. All these changes in social behaviour are related to the rational use of resources and make it easier to improve the existing infrastructures instead of building new ones. This paper analyses the state of the art at the European level in the production and use of renewable resources. A survey and analysis of the incentives to consumers and the policies to encourage the circular economy, and parallel analysis of benefits and drawbacks, was made. It is intended to identify the main forms of intervention and improvement, culminating in a reflection on how they should be applied to improve the expected results and make them more efficient and sustainable. This is intended to be an evolutionary framework of this concept, from the first stage of use of energy to its final utilisation. By approaching the task in a heuristic fashion, it is hoped to make the environment healthier, and it is envisaged that this concept will evolve from a linear to a life cycle approach."
1632,I,"In this work, we investigate the influence of the internal electric field induced by the polarization inside the active region of the p-i-n photodiode on the characteristics of InN/InxGa1-xN quantum dots intermediate band solar cell. Considering the conduction and valence band offsets, the electron and hole energy levels have been determined by solving analytically the corresponding Schrodinger equations. The hole level, usually neglected in similar studies, is taken into account to determine all the intermediate transitions. All parameters of multiple quantum dot solar cells such as open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current density and photovoltaic conversion efficiency are determined as functions of the indium content, the internal electric field, inter-dot distances and dot sizes. Our calculations show that determining the photovoltaic conversion efficiency (eta) without taking into account the internal electric field leads to an overestimation of eta."
1633,I,"To maintain the energy quality with high temperature and reduce the energy loss of seasonal heat-storage in solar-assisted ground-source heat pumps (SAGSHPs), a novel SAGSHP system with the heat-cascading of borehole heat-exchangers was designed and its field-test was conducted in this paper. The borehole heat-exchangers were divided into two regions: the core region and the peripheral region. The core region can maintain a high temperature (e.g. 45 degrees C), which is much higher than in previous studies, and the heat from this region can be used directly, without the operation of a heat pump. A field-test was conducted in a community in the province Shandong, China. The results indicate that a sufficient soil-temperature gradient (the temperature is high in the core but low at the periphery) can be created and maintained. The monthly averaged borehole-wall-temperature difference between the borehole heat-exchangers (BHEs) at the core and the periphery can be as high as 30.1 degrees C. This means that both cascaded heat-storage and heat-utilization can be realized. In addition, an average performance of CCOP = 5.15 and SCOP = 4.66 can be achieved. Compared with previous studies, despite the lower CCOP, a higher SCOP can be attained, thanks to heat cascade storage and -utilization. The novel approach described in this paper represents a viable alternative for space heating in North China."
1634,I,"This paper introduces a novel technique to assess the alignment quality of heliostats in operation. This technique combines theoretical imaging with aerial vision of an object heliostat reflecting the back of a neighbor target heliostat. An accurate optical model is developed to generate the theoretical images that allows to detect alignment errors by superposition on actual photographs. The resulting code is grounded in geometric transformations between systems of coordinates, and makes use of the pinhole camera model and the geometric determination of reflection points in concave mirrors. The optical model is experimentally validated with real heliostats at the National Solar Thermal Test Facility (NSTTF). In terms of pixel shifts in the target-reflected image, a sensitivity analysis of the technique is performed. The influence of several geometric factors is researched: camera position, camera focal length, heliostat-to-camera distance, and curvature of the facets. Preliminary analysis shows that canting errors as low as 0.25 mrad can be detected by facet framing."
1635,I,"The temperature dependence (in range from 24 to 290 K) of Raman spectroscopy of the Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) films with Zn-rich (series A) and Zn-poor (series B) composition obtained on a Ta foil is investigated. Analisys and approximation by the Lorentz function of the CZTSe Raman spectra suggests that the CZTSe most intense Raman peak consists of two modes (at 192/189 and 194/195 cm(-1)), which are slightly shifted from each other. In addition, the Raman peaks around 192 and 189 cm(-1) lead to asymmetric broadening of dominant peaks at 194 and 195 cm(-1) in Raman spectra of the CZTSe films series A and B, respectively. In the case of the Sn-rich CZTSe films, we attribute of Raman peak around 189 cm(-1) to SnSe2 compound. However in the case of the Sn-poor CZTSe films, the observable shift is too high to assign confidently the 192 cm(-1) band to a SnSe2 compound, which was not detected by XRD analysis. We suppose that this mode is attributed to disordered kesterite structure. The temperature dependence Raman spectra for both series of the CZTSe films shows that a change temperature from 290 to 24 K leads to position shift and narrowing of the CZTSe Raman A-modes. The calculated temperature coefficients and anharmonic constants in Klemens model approximations for temperature dependence of shift position and FWHM of the CZTSe A-modes shown that four-phonon process has dominant contribution in damping process and as a consequence in Raman spectrum changes for two series of the CZTSe films."
1636,I,"In photovoltaics, light harvesting is one of the critical factors for the enhancement of power conversion efficiency (PCE). Photon harvesting can be carried out by various methods in perovskite photovoltaic. The improved light harvesting can also be achieved by trapping the light by incorporating metallic nanoparticles at the interface or in the perovskite active layer itself. Either light is absorbed or scattered by metallic nanoparticles depending on the particle size. When light is absorbed by the nanoparticles (size < 20 nm), it behaves like a sub-wavelength antenna due to localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) excitation and hence near field effect of plasmonic particle will be interacting to CH3NH3PbI3 active layer. Larger particles (> 20 nm) act as subwavelength scattering centers of light and help in trapping incident light. In order to make use of dual effect poly-dispersed spherical aluminium nanoparticles (AlNPs) (size - 20-70 nm) were incorporated in the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cell at the PC61BM/Al electrode interface. As a result, there is an increase in the optical absorption in the AlNPs embedded device. A detailed study of optical absorption, absorbed light emission characteristics charge trap density and carrier concentration studies, photovoltaic property measurements indicates, improvement in power conversion efficiency arise due to enhancement in J(SC). Evaluated device properties indicate that enhancement in JSC arises due to improvement in the active layer photon absorption by both scattering and plasmonic effect in addition to reduced series resistance."
1637,I,"In real engineering of solar thermal applications, it needs considerable effort to determine the incidence angle modifier (IAM) of flat plate solar collectors, according to the test standards (BS EN ISO 9806, 2017; ASHRAE 93-2010, 2014). And the available method in the test standards is usually inapplicable to measure thermal performance of installed solar collectors with dust deposition effect in service. A quick measurement method is therefore presented to identify the IAM of flat plate solar collectors with less effort using a spectroradiometer. The quick method developed was validated with optical tests of a solar panel under the conditions of different incidence angles. It is inferred that the method not only helps to determine the IAM of flat plate solar collectors quickly without needing to run the collectors by energy power input, but also provides a pathway for assessing dust deposition effect on the thermal performance of installed flat plate solar collectors in service, as well as for determining the optical property attenuation of solar collectors in the long-term running."
1638,I,"To utilize nanofluids for direct absorption solar collectors (DASCs), they need to maintain their performance and physicochemical stability with exposure to solar radiation. In the present studies, three water-based nanofluids were characterized under light exposure, including silver nanoprisms (AgNPrs), silica coated silver nanoprisms (SiO2@AgNPr) and silica (SiO2) nanoparticles. Their temperature profiles and stability were monitored using simulated sunlight (SSL) and natural sunlight exposure (NSL), quantified by UV-vis spectroscopy and, in the case of SSL, characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). With SSL both silver nanofluids showed an increase in maximum temperature of approximately 40-45 degrees C, with a photo-conversion efficiency of about three times greater than the SiO2 nanofluid and water base-fluid. Stability tests showed the SiO2@AgNPr nanomaterial to be morphologically unstable, with the AgNPrs etching over a period of several hours. The AgNPrs showed a higher tendency to aggregation than SiO2@AgNPr nanofluids when exposed to NSL sunlight over a two-week period. Contrarily, the latter exhibited notable changing in shape, consequently effecting the absorption band position. The results highlight strongly the need for stability trials under realistic conditions for the development of nanofluids for direct solar absorption."
1639,I,"The built environment is particularly sensitive to elevated temperatures across urban areas. Furthermore, engineered materials usually amplify surface overheating, exacerbating urban heat island and cooling energy needs. In the last decades, the scientific community introduced a new class of materials, i.e. cool materials, in the attempt of mitigating these phenomena. In this context, this work investigates the hygrothermal and radiative potential of phosphorescent-based paving solutions and benchmarks their performance against commercially available cool concrete. To this end, an extensive outdoor monitoring campaign was carried out in terms of surface/air temperature, relative humidity, reflected solar radiation and wind speed/direction during summer 2019. Phosphorescent-based fields were found to maintain lower superficial temperature than the reference during the hottest hours of the day, by up to 0.9 degrees C and 3.3 degrees C in terms of average and absolute values, respectively. Even though other cooling techniques have been found to have higher cooling effect, the outcomes of this study, reveal for a first time, (i) the promising thermal behavior of phosphorescent-based pavements, as well as (ii) their potential for developing advanced cool materials equipped with both radiation reflection and reemission mechanisms."
1640,I,"Ferroelectric semiconductors like BiFeO3 are increasingly being investigated for applications in solar energy conversion and storage due to their intrinsic ability to induce ferroelectric polarization-driven separation of the photogenerated charge carriers resulting in above-bandgap photovoltages. Nevertheless, the BiFeO3 has been commonly prepared using complex and expensive fabrication techniques, e.g., epitaxial growth, radio frequency sputtering and pulsed laser deposition, which are not economically viable for large-scale production. Herein, we report a facile and scalable method for the fabrication of porous perovskite BiFeO3 photoanodes, as well as sequential interfacial engineering methods to enhance their photoelectrochemical performance for water splitting. Upon atomic layer deposition of a TiO2 overlayer and photo-assisted electrodeposition of a cobalt oxide/oxyhydroxide co-catalyst, the photocurrent density of the engineered photoanode for oxygen evolution reaction (1 M NaOH) significantly increased from negligible photocurrent of the pristine BiFeO3 to 0.16 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under simulated 1 sun irradiation (100 mW cm(-2), AM1.5G spectrum). Furthermore, such functionalization of the BiFeO3 photoanodes shifts the photoelectrochemical oxidation onset potential by 0.7 V down to 0.6 V vs. RHE. The significantly enhanced photoelectro-oxidation activity is facilitated by the improved charge transfer and electrochemical kinetics."
1641,J,"Zn2+ is involved in a number of biological processes and its wide-ranging roles at the subcellular level, especially in specific organelles, have not yet been fully established due to a lack of tools to image it effectively. We report a new and efficient modular double 'click' approach towards a range of sub-cellular localised probes for mobile zinc. Through this methodology, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria and lysosome localised probes were successfully prepared which show good fluorescence responses to mobile Zn2+ in vitro and in cellulo whilst a non-targeting probe was synthesized as a control. The methodology appears to have wide-utility for the generation of sub-cellular localised probes by incorporating specific organelle targeting vectors for mobile Zn2+ imaging."
1642,J,"Herein, an efficient asymmetric aminoalkylation of pyrazolones with alpha-amido sulfones catalyzed by a quinine-derived squaramide in dichloromethane/aqueous media has been established. A variety of chiral amines were obtained with high yields (up to 98%) and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee). The corresponding products are transformed into optically active acetylated pyrazoles after treatment with Ac2O/Et3N, because of the instability of some adducts. The reaction tolerates a wide range of alpha-amido sulfones and different pyrazolones."
1643,J,"E1cB and E2 eliminations have been described as competing mechanisms that can even share a common pathway when the E1cB/E2 borderline mechanism operates. A suitable case study evincing such a mechanistic dichotomy corresponds to the elimination reaction of beta-phenylmercaptoethyl phenolate, since its mechanism has been thought to be an E2 elimination. Nonetheless, according to the computational assessment of the substituents on the leaving group, we demonstrate that the reaction proceeds via a borderline E1cB mechanism. Stabilization of the carbanion was provided not only by substituent effects tuning the nucleofugality of the leaving group, but also by a base, since distortion/interaction-activation strain and Natural Bond Order (NBO) analyses suggest a stabilizing interaction between the base and C-beta of the E1cB intermediate. In order to gain insights into these results in a more general context, we have rationalized them with a qualitative picture of the E1cB/E2 mechanistic dichotomy using simple relationships between diabatic parabolas modeling the potential wells of reactants, intermediates, and products. In this Diabatic Model of Intermediate Stabilization (DMIS), the borderline E1cB mechanism for the elimination reaction of beta-phenylmercaptoethyl phenolate was discussed in terms of bonding and dynamic stepwise processes. The conceptual model presented herein should be useful for the analysis of any reaction comprising competing one- and two-step mechanisms."
1644,J,"Collagen is an abundant component of the extracellular matrix and connective tissues. Some collagen-mimetic peptides (CMPs) that do not form homotrimers can anneal to damaged tissue. Here, through a computational screen, we identify (flpHypGly)(7) as an optimal monomeric CMP for heterotrimer formation. We find that (flpHypGly)(7) forms stable triple helices with (ProProGly)(7) but not with itself. The nonnatural amino acid HflpOH, which is (2S,4S)-4-fluoroproline, is not toxic to human fibroblasts or keratinocytes. Conjugation of (flpHypGly)(7) to a fluorescent dye enables the facile detection of burned collagenous tissue with high specificity. The ubiquity of collagen and the prevalence of injuries and diseases that disrupt endogenous collagen suggests widespread utility for this approach."
1645,J,"The stereospecific gold(i)-catalyzed nucleophilic cyclization of beta-monosubstituted o-(alkynyl)styrenes to produce C-1 functionalized 1H-indenes including challenging substrates and nucleophiles, such as beta-(cyclo)alkyl-substituted o-(alkynyl)styrenes and a variety of alcohols as well as selected electron-rich aromatics, is reported. DFT calculations support the stereochemical outcome of the process that involves the formation of a key cyclopropyl gold carbene intermediate through a regiospecific 5-endo cyclization."
1646,J,"A water-soluble pillar[5]arene, decafunctionalized with thioether and carboxylate fragments, was synthesized as a structural analogue of Sugammadex. Its ability to restore the contraction of the diaphragm muscle by encapsulating the muscle relaxant rocuronium bromide was demonstrated. Using UV-vis, NMR and fluorescence spectroscopy, it was shown that the muscle relaxant is associated with the pillar[5]arene with an association constant of 4500 M-1 and a stoichiometry of 1 : 1. The structure of the inclusion complex of the pillar[5]arene with rocuronium bromide was additionally investigated by quantum chemical methods."
1647,J,"Diversely substituted 1,2-oxathiine 2,2-dioxides, including 3,5,6-triaryl-, 3,6-diaryl-, 3,5-diaryl-, 5,6-diaryl- and selected fused heterocyclic analogues, have been efficiently obtained by the application of a mild Cope elimination of a 4-amino moiety from the requisite 4-amino-3,4-dihydro-1,2-oxathiine 2,2-dioxides, which themselves were readily obtained by the addition of sulfenes to enaminoketones."
1648,J,"1,2-Oxathiine 2,2-dioxides have been obtained from their respective 3,4-dihydro-4-dimethylamino precursors, for the first time, by a mild Cope elimination of the 4-dimethylamino function. The application of the 1,2-oxathiine 2,2-dioxide scaffold in materials chemistry is exemplified by the efficient P-type photochromism of the 5,6-bis(2,5-dimethyl-3-thienyl) substituted oxathiine 2,2-dioxides."
1649,J,"This study investigates the synthesis of beta-branched amines and beta-branched quaternary ammonium chloride ionic liquids as novel extractants. The synthesis methodology was tailored to facilitate the reaction scale-up and the use of biorenewable starting materials. The developed process is an overall green, easy and straightforward synthesis of beta-branched amines, and ammonium salts, starting from linear aldehydes. In order to evaluate the potential of the synthesised materials in applications, the rheology, density, thermal stability, chemical stability, phase transitions, and mutual solubility with water of the novel extractants was studied."
1650,J,"5,7-Di-N-acetyllegionaminic acid (Leg5,7Ac(2)) is a bacterial nonulosonic acid (NulO) analogue of sialic acids, an important class of monosaccharides in mammals and in some bacteria. To develop efficient one-pot multienzyme (OPME) glycosylation systems for synthesizing Leg5,7Ac(2)-glycosides, Legionella pneumophila cytidine 5 '-monophosphate (CMP)-Leg5,7Ac(2) synthetase (LpCLS) was cloned and characterized. It was successfully used in producing Leg5,7Ac(2)-glycosides from chemoenzymatically synthesized Leg5,7Ac(2) using a one-pot two-enzyme system or from its chemically synthesized six-carbon monosaccharide precursor 2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxymannose (6deoxyMan2,4diNAc) in a one-pot three-enzyme system. In addition, LpCLS was shown to tolerate Neu5Ac7NAc, a C9-hydroxyl analogue of Leg5,7Ac(2) and also a stable analogue of 7-O-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,7Ac(2)), to allow OPME synthesis of the corresponding alpha 2-3-linked sialosides, from chemically synthesized six-carbon monosaccharide precursor 4-N-acetyl-4-deoxy-N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc7NAc)."
1651,J,"Phosphocholine is a small haptenic molecule that is both a precursor and degradation product of choline. Phosphocholine decorates a number of biologics such as lipids and oligosaccharides. In this study, an air and bench stable phosphocholine donor has been developed and evaluated with a number of alcohol acceptors. Using a one-pot, three-step sequence, (phosphitylation, oxidation, and phosphate deprotection) phosphocholine derivatives are synthesized in high yields. Of particular interest is the synthesis of miltefosine, the lone oral drug approved to treat leishmaniasis. Due to its prohibitive expense ($1500 per g), miltefosine is not accesable for the majority of the world's patients. Based on the described reaction sequence, this drug can be produced for $25 per g."
1652,J,The linear synthesis of the N-terminal domain of mISG15 has been developed which enables the synthesis of full-length mISG15 and the activity-based probe Rho-mISG15-PA via native chemical ligation. Pilot experiments showed that the synthetic proteins were properly folded and recognized by endogenous enzymes. Our synthesis strategy allows the generation of other mISG15-based probes and reagents that can accelerate the research in this field.
1653,J,"A one-pot procedure for preparing a series of chiral imines by direct condensation of d-glucamine with 2-hydroxyacetophenones is described. Under conventional acetylation an unexpected mixture of two different peracetylated molecules is obtained, one with an open enamine structure, and the other incorporating an N-acetyl-1,3-oxazolidine into the acyclic skeleton. Surprisingly, both molecules coexist within the crystal's unit cell, as inferred from single-crystal X-ray analysis of a 5-bromo-substituted aryl derivative. Moreover, the 1,3-oxazolidine ring exists as rotational conformers (E,Z) owing to the restricted rotation around the N-acetyl bond. The equilibrium involving imine and enamine structures has been assessed in detail, providing in addition linear free-energy relationships between the tautomerization constants (K-T) and the electronic effect of the substituents."
1654,J,"This study extends our interest in the synthesis and conformational behaviour of all-syn multivicinal fluoro alkane motifs. Specifically an all-syn 1,2,3,6,7,8-hexafluorooctane chain was assembled with a run of three fluorines, of the same stereochemical sense (syn) to the direction of the chain, on each side of an ethylene (-CH2CH2-) spacer to explore if the helical sense of the chain crosses the ethylene bridge. The solid state (X-ray) structure indicated a continuous helix however in solution (NMR) and by DFT computation, although the individual all-syn 1,2,3-trifluoro motifs maintain good helical integrity, the molecule is much more dynamic across the ethylene bridge. It was notable however that a low energy, non-helical conformer has a high molecular dipole (mu = 7.15 D) indicating a role for this skipped motif in soft materials such as liquid crystals or polar polymers."
1655,J,"Nine modified nucleosides, incorporating zinc-binding pharmacophores, have been synthesised and evaluated as inhibitors of the DNA repair nuclease SNM1A. The series included oxyamides, hydroxamic acids, hydroxamates, a hydrazide, a squarate ester and a squaramide. A hydroxamic acid-derived nucleoside inhibited the enzyme, offering a novel approach for potential therapeutic development through the use of rationally designed nucleoside derived inhibitors."
1656,J,"Identification of pheromone receptors plays a central role for uncovering signaling pathways that underlie chemical communication in animals. Here, we describe the synthesis and bioactivity of photoaffinity probes for the ascaroside ascr#8, a sex-pheromone of the model nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. Structure-activity studies guided incorporation of alkyne- and diazirine-moieties and revealed that addition of functionality in the sidechain of ascr#8 was well tolerated, whereas modifications to the ascarylose moiety resulted in loss of biological activity. Our study will guide future probe design and provides a basis for pheromone receptor identification via photoaffinity labeling in C. elegans."
1657,J,"Cholera is a potentially fatal bacterial infection caused by the cholera toxin (CT), an AB(5) toxin secreted by Vibrio cholera. GM1 has long been known as the receptor of the cholera toxin in the intestine. However, increasing evidence is pointing towards the role of fucosylated conjugates as additional attachment options of the toxin. In the present paper we have synthesized a polymeric hybrid which can inhibit both modes of attachment."
1658,J,"A ruthenium-catalyzed cycloisomerization of 3-amino-4-alkynyl-2H-chromen-2-ones via 1,2-carbon migration was developed. Various 1-arylchromeno[3,4-b]pyrrol-4(3H)-ones were synthesized in good to excellent yields. The reaction was applied to the formal total synthesis of marine natural products Ningalin B and Lamellarin H. The efficient synthesis of gamma-butyrolactone-fused pyrrole derivatives was also achieved."
1659,J,"The self-assembly of small peptides into larger aggregates is an important process for the fundamental understanding of abiogenesis. In this article we demonstrate that blends of cyclic dipeptides (2,5-diketopiperazines - DKPs) bearing either histidine or cysteine in combination with a lipophilic amino acid form highly stable aggregates in aqueous solution with esterase-like activity. We demonstrate that the catalytic activity is based on an intermolecular cooperative behavior between histidine and cysteine. A high control of the molecular arrangement of the peptide assemblies was gained by C-H-pi interactions between Phe and Leu or Val sidechains, resulting in a significant increase in catalytic activity. These interactions were strongly supported by Hartree-Fock calculations and finally confirmed via(1)H-NMR HRMAS NOE spectroscopy."
1660,J,"2,7-Disubstituted oxazolo[5,4-f]quinoxalines were synthesized from 6-amino-2-chloroquinoxaline in four steps (iodination at C5, substitution of the chloro group, amidation and copper-catalysed cyclization) affording 28 to 44% overall yields. 2,8-Disubstituted oxazolo[5,4-f]quinoxaline was similarly obtained from 6-amino-3-chloroquinoxaline (39% overall yield). For the synthesis of other oxazolo[5,4-f]quinoxalines, amidation was rather performed before substitution; moreover, time-consuming purification steps were avoided between the amines and the final products (38 to 54% overall yields). Finally, a more efficient method involving merging of the last two steps in a sequential process was developed to access more derivatives (37 to 65% overall yields). Most of the oxazolo[5,4-f]quinoxalines were evaluated for their activity on a panel of protein kinases, and a few 2,8-disubstituted derivatives proved to inhibit GSK3 kinase. While experiments showed an ATP-competitive inhibition on GSK3 beta, structure-activity relationships allowed us to identify 2-(3-pyridyl)-8-(thiomorpholino)oxazolo[5,4-f]quinoxaline as the most potent inhibitor with an IC50 value of about 5 nM on GSK3 alpha."
1661,J,"The design of glycogen phosphorylase (GP) inhibitors targeting the catalytic site of the enzyme is a promising strategy for a better control of hyperglycaemia in the context of type 2 diabetes. Glucopyranosylidene-spiro-heterocycles have been demonstrated as potent GP inhibitors, and more specifically spiro-oxathiazoles. A new synthetic route has now been elaborated through 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of an aryl nitrile oxide to a glucono-thionolactone affording in one step the spiro-oxathiazole moiety. The thionolactone was obtained from the thermal rearrangement of a thiosulfinate precursor according to Fairbanks' protocols, although with a revisited outcome and also rationalised with DFT calculations. The 2-naphthyl substituted glucose-based spiro-oxathiazole 5h, identified as one of the most potent GP inhibitors (K-i = 160 nM against RMGPb) could be produced on the gram-scale from this strategy. Further evaluation in vitro using rat and human hepatocytes demonstrated that compound 5h is a anti-hyperglycaemic drug candidates performing slightly better than DAB used as a positive control. Investigation in Zucker fa/fa rat model in acute and subchronic assays further confirmed the potency of compound 5h since it lowered blood glucose levels by similar to 36% at 30 mg kg(-1) and similar to 43% at 60 mg kg(-1). The present study is one of the few in vivo investigations for glucose-based GP inhibitors and provides data in animal models for such drug candidates."
1662,J,"We herein report a novel entry towards chiral alpha-SCF3-beta(2,2)-amino acids by carrying out the ammonium salt-catalyzed alpha-trifluoromethylthiolation of isoxazolidin-5-ones. This approach allowed for high enantioselectivities and high yields and the obtained heterocycles proved to be versatile platforms to access other targets of potential interest."
1663,J,"A robust lipophilic dye, based on the structures of the benzothiadiazole heterocycle, was shown to be a potent fluorescent stain for the selective imaging of lipid droplets (LDs) within both live and fixed human cells. Its small molecular framework, large Stokes shift, and vastly improved photostability over that of the current status quo, Nile Red, highlight its tremendous potential as a versatile chemical tool for facilitating LD imaging and research."
1664,J,The growing threat of antibacterial resistance is a global concern. The so-called calcium-dependent lipopeptide antibiotics (CDAs) have emerged as a promising source of new antibiotic agents that are rich in structural and mechanistic diversity. Over forty unique CDAs have been identified to date and share a number of common features. Recent efforts in our group have provided new mechanistic and structural insights into the laspartomycin family of CDAs. We here describe investigations aimed at probing the role of the three glycine residues found in the laspartomycin peptide macrocycle. In doing so laspartomycin analogues containing the achiral 2-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB) as well as l- or d-alanine in place of glycine were prepared and their antibacterial activities evaluated.
1665,J,"Mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase (MDD) catalyses a crucial step of the mevalonate pathway via Mg2+-ATP-dependent phosphorylation and decarboxylation reactions to ultimately produce isopentenyl diphosphate, the precursor of isoprenoids, which is essential to bacterial functions and provides ideal building blocks for the biosynthesis of isopentenols. However, the metal ion(s) in MDD has not been unambiguously resolved, which limits the understanding of the catalytic mechanism and the exploitation of enzymes for the development of antibacterial therapies or the mevalonate metabolic pathway for the biosynthesis of biofuels. Here by analogizing structurally related kinases and molecular dynamics simulations, we constructed a model of the MDD-substrate-ATP-Mg2+ complex and proposed that MDD requires two Mg2+ ions for maintaining a catalytically active conformation. Subsequent QM/MM studies indicate that MDD catalyses the phosphorylation of its substrate mevalonate diphosphate (MVAPP) via a direct phosphorylation reaction, instead of the previously assumed catalytic base mechanism. The results here would shed light on the active conformation of MDD-related enzymes and their catalytic mechanisms and therefore be useful for developing novel antimicrobial therapies or reconstructing mevalonate metabolic pathways for the biosynthesis of biofuels."
1666,J,"Double hydrothiolation of bis enol ether macrocycles was achieved under photo-mediated conditions. The thiol-ene reactions afford a fully regioselective anti-Markovnikov post-functionalization. Thanks to the use of ethanedithiol as reagent, moderate to excellent diastereoselectivity was accomplished leading to macrocycles containing four defined stereocenters in only three steps from 1,4-dioxane, tetrahydrofuran (THF) or tetrahydropyran (THP)."
1667,J,"We have developed a carbonylative approach to the synthesis of diversely substituted 2-aroylbenzoate esters featuring a new protocol for the carbonylative coupling of aryl bromides with boronic acids and a new strategy to favour carbonylative over non-carbonylative reactions. Two different synthetic pathways - (i) the alkoxycarbonylation of 2-bromo benzophenones and (ii) the carbonylative Suzuki-Miyaura coupling of 2-bromobenzoate esters - were evaluated. The latter approach provided a broader substrate tolerance, and thus was the preferred pathway. We observed that 2-substituted aryl bromides were challenging substrates for carbonylative chemistry favouring the non-carbonylative pathway. However, we found that carbonylative Suzuki-Miyaura couplings can be improved by slow addition of the boronic acid, suppressing the unwanted direct Suzuki coupling and, thus increasing the yield of the carbonylative reaction."
1668,J,"1,2-Bis(2-allylphenyl)ethynes undergo cycloisomerisation reactions in the presence of Cp*Ru(ii) catalysts to produce 2,2 '-dimethyl-3H,3 ' H-1,1 '-biindenes. On the other hand, tandem ring-closing metathesis of 1,2-bis(2-allylphenyl)ethynes using the Hoveyda-Grubbs 2nd generation catalyst led to the formation of 2,2 '-unsubstituted biindenes. Various symmetrical and unsymmetrical bicyclic dienes were prepared by these ruthenium-based cyclisation methods."
1669,J,"Here, we report that the combination of cationic iron porphyrins with sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) gives rise to efficient micellar catalysis of cyclopropanation reactions of styrene derivatives, using diazoacetates as carbene precursors. This simple, yet effective approach for cyclopropanations illustrates the power of micellar catalysis."
1670,J,Computed association strengths for 43 purine and pteridine quartets (38 to 100 kcal mol(-1)) show excellent linear correlation with pi-conjugation gain in the assembled monomers (r(2) = 0.965). Even quartets having the same secondary electrostatic interactions can display very different association strengths depending on the pi-conjugation patterns of the monomeric units.
1671,J,"Density functional theory (DFT) at the SMD/M06-2X/def2-TZVP//SMD/M06-2X/LANL2DZ(d),6-31G(d) level was used to explore the regioselective double oxidation of phenols by a hypervalent iodine(v) reagent (IBX) to give o-quinones. The oxidative dearomatization commences with the ligand exchange between IBX and phenol, yielding a phenolate complex, followed by the first redox process, which reduces iodine(v) to iodine(iii). Both the processes (the ligand exchange and the first redox reaction) were found to be mediated by a less stable isomer of iodine(v) species. We found that although the first redox process preferentially proceeds via an associative pathway, an electron withdrawing substituent on the phenol ring decreases its accessibility. The inspection of the electronic structure of the redox transition state indicates that the phenolate involved in the iodine(v) reduction has some phenoxenium character. The intrinsic stability of a phenoxenium ion is calculated to be highly sensitive to the substituent on the phenol ring. Since the electron withdrawing substituents considerably decrease the stability of the phenoxenium, they render the iodine(v) to iodine(iii) reduction energy consuming. Once the first redox step has completed, a catechol-iodine(iii) complex is formed, from which the second redox process produces the final o-quinone product via a carboxylate-assisted transition structure. This transition structure gains stability by hydrogen bond interaction between the catechol OH and carboxylate group. Such an interaction results in the phenolate not having any phenoxenium character in the transition structure, thus making the activation barrier to the second redox step independent from the substituent on the phenol ring."
1672,J,"The Glaser-Hay bioconjugation has recently emerged as an efficient and attractive method to generate stable, useful bioconjugates with numerous applications, specifically in the field of therapeutics. Herein, we investigate the mechanism of the aqueous Glaser-Hay coupling to better understand optimization strategies. In doing so, it was identified that catalase is able to minimize protein oxidation and improve coupling efficiency, suggesting that hydrogen peroxide is produced during the aqueous Glaser-Hay bioconjugation. Further, several new ligands were investigated to minimize protein oxidation and maximize coupling efficiency. Finally, two novel strategies to streamline the Glaser-Hay bioconjugation and eliminate the need for secondary purification have been developed."
